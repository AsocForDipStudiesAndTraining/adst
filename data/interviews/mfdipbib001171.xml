                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fred, why don't we start at the beginning. Could you tell
                        me when and where you were born and a bit about your family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I was born on 15 November 1927. My father was then stationed at Fort
                    Huachuca, Arizona. He was a first lieutenant of cavalry. He was a troop
                    commander there with the buffalo soldiers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, these were the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: The black soldiers, 10th Cavalry. He also commanded what was left of the
                    detachment of Apache scouts. It was an interesting post, and I'm now working on
                    some history of that for my grandchildren.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went down there and saw it about four years ago. They've
                        got a nice museum there and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: He lived in what is now a general-officer's house. These were the old
                    officers quarters there on the post that faced on to the parade ground. I was
                    born in the dispensary there.</p>
                <p>I was a baby, I think six or eight months old, when he was transferred to Fort
                    Des Moines, Iowa, where he became an officer in the 14th Cavalry. We were there
                    for maybe four years, where two of my sisters were born.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>The horse cavalry was breaking up; my dad didn't like tanks, so he thought he'd
                    try the Army Air Corps. He'd come out of the Naval Academy; because he was
                    chronically seasick, he took a commission in the Army. We went down to Randolph
                    Field, Texas, but he ended up having the same trouble flying airplanes that he
                    had riding on ships. Then he took a transfer to the Quartermaster Corps and
                    became a supply logistics contracting officer. He got in a big fight, I remember
                    as a boy, with the Borden milk people at Randolph Field, because he insisted
                    upon giving the contract for the milk there to a local dairy that was
                    underbidding Borden. They went after him. They sent people to try to bribe him
                    and to threaten him. They said they'd get him out of there, which they did.</p>
                <p>They had him transferred to the Philippines. My mother's health wasn't good, and
                    the Army had promised not to send him to an unhealthy post. Despite this
                    promise, we were transferred to Fort Mills, Corregidor, which was the island in
                    the entrance to Manila Harbor. It was a great adventure for a boy of my age at
                    that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this, in the early '30s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: This was the mid-'30s. I had a horse, and I remember going up to Fort
                    Stotsenberg to visit some of my parents' friends, who were there with the 26th
                    Cavalry, and going on maneuvers with the regiment to Lingayen Gulf and back
                    through Bataan peninsula. Down from there when the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's where the Japanese invaded.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: It was a very adventuresome time for a boy, let's put it that way.</p>
                <p>We came back after a two-year assignment there; my father was assigned to the
                    quartermaster school, as a student, in Philadelphia. I spent a year in the south
                    side of Philadelphia learning what it was to be around tough gangs and how to
                    get along in a school where you had gangs. It was mostly Italian and black
                    toughs. But I had to learn to use my fists, and that was another sort of
                    educational experience. We lived in a middle class ghetto called Girard Estates
                    that had been built there by Mr. Girard for preachers and soldiers, military
                    officers. It was in the middle of this very poor section of the city; so you had
                    this real mixture.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>From there, his next assignment was a place called Jeffersonville QM Depot,
                    Jeffersonville, Indiana. It's right across the river from Louisville. He was a
                    major by then. I can still remember, there, he got in a lot of trouble with
                    Senator Minton. It was because he was trying to prevent the sale of cast iron to
                    the Japanese. He had a lot of this under his control. There were local
                    commercial interests that would have profited from this sale; therefore they
                    went after him through this senator. A big investigation. It was all over the
                    front page of the papers. In the end, they had to apologize. The apology was
                    carried in the back pages, in small print. The usual thing.</p>
                <p>I was brought up in what you might say was family where honesty and courage as a
                    government servant meant something.</p>
                <p>There, he became sick, very sick. There is still a lot of question in my family's
                    mind as to why. There was a lot of experimental medicine going on, and there
                    were a lot of people, because of this political thing, that wanted him out of
                    that post. He ended up at Walter Reed, with a complete nervous breakdown. This
                    just didn't fit. They'd shot a lot of stuff into him. I'm asking for records
                    now; I'm looking into all this, to try to find out more of really what went
                    on.</p>
                <p>He'd been highly decorated in World War I, and he'd been the only cavalry officer
                    to be decorated for cavalry action in World War I. His troop commander, when he
                    was a 2nd lieutenant and had a platoon, was by then a major general and was
                    going to Europe in the Second World War. He came to see my Dad. I was present
                    when he was there. He told my father there were two stars waiting for him if
                    he'd get out of the hospital and take over a division. But his health never came
                    back.</p>
                <p>Then he was forced into retirement, with complete disability. We moved to a small
                    town, temporarily, to find out what we wanted to do, called Cambridge, Ohio. We
                    stayed there a year, and then we went on to Lewisburg, Pennsylvania because we
                    found a house my mother liked. Because he thought he was going to die, we bought
                    this house. He had to crawl up the stairs, he was in such bad shape.</p>
                <p>I was sent to a military prep school (Augusta Military Academy, Fort Defiance,
                    Va.) because of the problems he was having. I had three younger sisters. I, of
                    course, like my father, wanted to be a military officer. I really didn't belong
                    being one; I was about 110 pounds, soaking wet, and didn't have the physique for
                    it. But I managed to graduate first in my class (June, 1945) from a military
                    school in Virginia and got the honor-graduate appointment to West Point.</p>
                <p>When I arrived at West Point, the doctors looked at where I was born and said,
                    “You're an Army brat.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes.”</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>And they said, “Well, you're 15 pounds underweight, but we're going to cut your
                    height by two inches.”</p>
                <p>So I was officially two inches shorter than I really was, and they let me in. But
                    I didn't last but a month or two. I just physically passed out. And so they told
                    me, if I resigned and got my health and some size on me, I could come back.</p>
                <p>I resigned and was very unhappy and very disappointed with myself, like a lot of
                    people can be at that age.</p>
                <p>We lived in Lewisburg where Bucknell University is located.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's have a date or two here. When did you go to West
                        Point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Nineteen forty-five.</p>
                <p>When I returned home, I entered Bucknell. I had just barely finished the summer
                    out at West Point. They asked me what I wanted to take; I was typically cocky,
                    thinking no private college could be as tough as a service academy, as my father
                    had been a Naval Academy man. So I said, “What's the toughest course you folks
                    give?”</p>
                <p>They said, “Electrical engineering.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I'll take that.”</p>
                <p>Even though I had no idea what I was getting into, I signed up for a course in
                    electrical engineering.</p>
                <p>At the end of my first year, I still had this hope to go back to West Point. To
                    try to get my health up and get to be a bit bigger, I enlisted in the Army,
                    hoping to get an Army appointment.</p>
                <p>When boarding the special train of recruits and draftees in Harrisburg bound for
                    Ft. Meade, Md., the non-com at the train station put me in charge of the train
                    because of my previous service at the military academy. It was October 1946 when
                    I arrived at Fort Meade, Maryland, There, I took the AGC tests and received very
                    high scores. They shipped me off to engineering basic training at Fort
                    Belvoir.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>At Fort Belvoir, there was great pressure from returning veterans who wanted out
                    of the service. They didn't want to take the time to train new recruits. This
                    created a shortage of training cadre. For example in our training company, we
                    had only one officer who was my company commander, a captain. He noted I had
                    previous service. He sent for me and asked me my background. He said, “Well,
                    hell, you could train people in basic training. You know all this stuff.” (A
                    cadet out of VMI was there with me who was given the same treatment. They needed
                    cadre sgts.)</p>
                <p>So I was suddenly made a cadre sergeant, and I ended up training troops rather
                    than being given training. I had my own platoon, which consisted of 90 people.
                    Forty-five of them were toughs from New York and from Philadelphia. The other 45
                    mostly had doctorate degrees. They had been exempt all during the war because of
                    their education, and they were already working on the Manhattan and the rocket
                    projects. But the Army had suddenly decided to draft them at the end of the war.
                    They were due to be made senior sergeants the minute they got out of basic
                    training, but they had to go through basic training. I ended up being their
                    cadre sergeant.</p>
                <p>I called these fellows together because I knew I was dealing with two different
                    types of people; because they were a lot older than I was, maybe ten years my
                    senior, I said, “Look, you're married, you want your wives to come here, and
                    there's a lot of horse shit that goes on in this place. It's the nature of basic
                    training. I'll make sure you get to see your wives on the weekend if you make
                    sure that we do this horse shit right. When I blow that whistle, I want
                    everybody out there in line first. Now you guys ought to be able to figure out
                    scientifically how to do it that way.”</p>
                <p>Well, it was a great experience, because these fellows did figure it out. When
                    some of these kids tried to create problems, they made sure the problems didn't
                    exist. I made a compact with those fellows; some of them offered me jobs
                    later.</p>
                <p>Anyway, it was an interesting experience. By the time that one tranche of people
                    went through the system, they began closing my company down; I stayed with the
                    unit until the end. My CO had recommended to the post commander that I be given
                    an Army appointment to West Point. Again I was found wanting in weight.</p>
                <p>Then I was ordered to go to the West Coast, to a replacement depot, for shipment
                    to the Far East. I took leave and I ended up at Camp Stoneman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went through Camp Stoneman in early '52.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I got into Stoneman in early '47, maybe the 1st or 2nd of January. But I
                    kept being held up; I wasn't put on the ship. And I kept complaining. They had
                    me in this sergeant's barracks. But it gets very discouraging when you just sit
                    there and people go through.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know, because there's nothing to do there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Nothing to do and no place to go. At last, I got a call from the orderly
                    room of this holding company I was in to come down. And here was a Colonel
                    Fisher, who was chief of chaplains for the West Coast. He said, “You know, I
                    baptized you.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Oh, yes, I remember Mother talking about you.”</p>
                <p>My mother had written to Colonel Fisher. My father didn't know about it. Colonel
                    Fisher had placed a hold on me, that is, until he lined up a job for me there on
                    the West Coast, as a chaplain's assistant. I looked at him and I said, “I'm my
                    father's son. I don't want a job like that. You get me on the first ship out of
                    here. The first ship.”</p>
                <p>We went out to dinner; he took me home. He agreed to that, so that ended that
                    business.</p>
                <p>I ended up on the first ship out. I was made the sergeant in charge of the
                    Military Police detachment. My superior was a Military Police Captain. There was
                    a major who was troop commander on the ship. It was a military transport, and
                    you had all these different messes. You had an officers' mess, an enlisted men's
                    mess, a ships officers' mess, and they had all grades of food. I was brought up
                    by my old man who used to say, “You feed the horses, then the men, and then
                    yourself.” They put us all up in the fo'c'sle of this ship, all together, the
                    MPs. The food in the enlisted men's mess was crap, so we had a ratline, and we'd
                    go and steal food from the ships officers' mess. I can still remember being
                    called in by this captain, who said, “Do you need more Military Policemen?
                    There's a lot of pilferage going on from the ships officers' mess.”</p>
                <p>I looked at him and said, “Captain, any more men in my detachment and that
                    pilferage will get worse.”</p>
                <p>He got the point.</p>
                <p>It turned out that ship was going to Korea. We landed in Inchon, Korea sometime
                    in January of '47. And it was colder than hell; I nearly froze to death. Anyway,
                    I was due to be sent to an engineering construction group headquarters, at a
                    place called Yongdungpo, Korea. You've been in Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, it's just south of Seoul.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: It was pretty bleak. The present ambassador to Korea and I were
                    bunk-mates.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who's that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Jim Laney, a native of Arkansas and a Yale graduate. He later became a
                    missionary out there and more recently was President of Emory University. The
                    present administration appointed him ambassador to Korea. But then we bunked
                    next to each other and became very close friends.</p>
                <p>I'd only been there a month or two when a call came from 24th Corps headquarters
                    in Seoul for me to report to the sergeant major of the Corps. Verbal orders. I
                    went up there and I said, “Well, what's this all about?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Your name came out with two other names when we ran the computer...”
                    They had these punch cards. “With a very high AGC score.” He said, “We need
                    somebody like you to be attached to the United States-Soviet Joint Commission,
                    which is reopening. He ordered me to report to Brigadier General Weckerling at
                    the Duksu Palace. The Duksu Palace was just across and down the street from the
                    Bando Hotel, and inside a big compound.</p>
                <p>I reported to General Weckerling, who was a brigadier general directly assigned
                    from G-2, Washington, intelligence. He took my stripes off and put U.S.s on my
                    collar and said, “From now on, you're Mr. Thomas, and you'll eat and be housed
                    with the special troops for the 24th Corps; they'll give you a room out there.
                    I'll send a car for you every morning.” It was the damndest thing. My company
                    commander had a Jeep to run around in, and I was being picked up by a fancy
                    sedan. Anyway, that was my introduction to political work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously, you were seeing this from an enlisted man's
                        viewpoint, but I want to catch your viewpoint at various times. What was
                        Korea like in 1947?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: It was so backward; it reminded me of China in the 1930s, when my father
                    and I visited China. Beggars everywhere, filth. You'd come to work and go
                    through that gate, and here'd be people dead in the gateway, in the wintertime,
                    corpses. The smell of feces everywhere. The dust. It was just backward Orient at
                    that time. It was the worst of the worst.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, during the interim between when I was assigned this job,
                    when I was sitting out there at Yongdungpo, this fellow Laney and I dreamed up a
                    scheme to get out of Korea by enlisting in the paratroops. Neither one of us was
                    very big, about my height(5'10”); I was pretty skinny and so was he. There were
                    no paratroopers in Korea. The closest units were in Japan. We went to this
                    recruiting sergeant where they were looking for paratroopers, at 24th Corps
                    headquarters in Seoul. Well, this paratrooper looked at the two of us and told
                    us, “You don't belong in the paratroopers. You guys are much too little.” So
                    that ended that.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As soldiers, did you have any contact with Koreans,
                        particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Not immediately but later on in that job. I started out with Weckerling,
                    and I was doing sort of gofer work with the command, but intelligence command
                    work, digging up...</p>
                <p>The Draper Report, I remember that was a big report at the time. The Draper
                    Commission Report. It was all top secret. Draper was Under Secretary, or an
                    Assistant Secretary of Defense, who was visiting various places around the Far
                    East. The Defense Department's instructions indicated that the report concerning
                    the situation in Korea was to include many multi-colored charts to make quick
                    reading and comprehension possible.</p>
                <p>So I was given the job of arranging the publishing of these many multi-colored
                    charts and getting the job done in a hurry. It was done by a topographical unit
                    located on the outskirts of Seoul. I went out there and introduced myself.
                    General Weckerling called ahead and said I'd be coming, “Mr. Thomas.” When I
                    arrived, they said, “What do you want? We'll do anything you want.” So I had
                    this group of young people there working about 24-hours a day, with shifts
                    going, putting out these top-secret charts, in color, of everything that you
                    could think of, economic data, etc., to get it done in time for this Draper
                    Report. I can sort of remember falling asleep in the big, fancy room, trying to
                    get it all put together, because I'd been working long hours through the whole
                    three-week period.</p>
                <p>Once it was together, General Weckerling gave me some money to buy a few cases of
                    beer and some snack food to give these guys a party. As I was leaving this beer
                    party, they handed me an envelope, and they said, “Don't open this until you get
                    back to your room.” When I got home, I learned the great advantage of
                    first-class documentation. It turned out this unit not only made maps and
                    charts, but also made all the documentation for everything we did in Korea. In
                    this envelope was a mess pass for every mess in the command, with my name on it,
                    including a pass for the general officers' mess, and every other officers' mess.
                    Several extra PX ration cards were included so I could get extra cigarettes,
                    everything you needed. It was a real education on the value of good
                    documentation.</p>
                <p>Out of this, I began to notice these guys when I'd go to the PX. There they'd be
                    with duffel bags repeatedly going through the cigarette line and filling the
                    duffel bags... They could buy a carton of cigarettes for 90 cents, and they
                    could sell it for maybe $5 to $10 dollars in military scrip. They were all
                    making a quick profit. But you couldn't move this money out of the country
                    because you couldn't account for it; it was that funny money. They'd take this
                    money and buy the fanciest things in the PX, like fancy cameras. They all had
                    lockers full of fancy stuff.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>But by then, Jim Laney, who had been with me at the engineering unit had become
                    an agent in Army CIC. As an agent they make you a “Mister” CIC agents worked for
                    us. They came in and we gave them their orders of what we wanted collected, and
                    they collected it. Jim and I were sitting in my office, which was in a vault in
                    the basement of the museum building there. It was an actual vault. It was a
                    weekend evening, when suddenly the fire engines alarms went off. You could hear
                    it all over town. The fire was out at the edge of town. We were fire chasers and
                    we wanted to find out what was going on, so we jumped in Jim's Jeep and rushed
                    out there. This same topographical unit was burning to the ground. All these
                    guys lost all their loot. They never profited from it all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any contact with the Korean Army?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Oh, yes, later. Then I was moved to another job because Weckerling went
                    on to something else. I became the Boy Friday to a man named Dr. Ernst
                    Frankel(Ph.D.). Ernst Frankel was later among those who founded the Free Berlin
                    University. He was a noted scholar on constitutional law, and he helped write
                    the Korean Constitution. He was a GS-18 or equivalent in those days. But he was
                    a typical nice Jewish man who didn't know how to handle the military. He didn't
                    know how to use his rank. He and his wife had no children. They treated me as a
                    son, in a way. I was invited for Sunday dinners. I worked for him for a couple
                    of months, and then he was off to something.</p>
                <p>There was a group there that was doing the legwork for the POLAD. It was called
                    Political Advisory Group. It was made up of ex-State and -Foreign Service types
                    who had been in the military when they joined the group. Some of them had been
                    with OSS, left State during the Second World War. The head of group had been a
                    State officer, had his doctorate in Chinese studies and was the son of
                    missionaries to China, named Clyde Sergeant. He got to know me there on the
                    Joint Commission because we were all working in one area. He asked me to join
                    his group as the biographic officer. I was to set up the biographic files for
                    Korea (they didn't have anything like that), with the idea that these would end
                    up being the embassy's biographic files.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>When I started doing this, I quickly realized that if you tried to do this the
                    normal government way, with a lot of liberal people around, especially in many
                    of these government departments, you'd get nowhere. This was “spying.” So I was
                    not above a bit of prevarication, if I had to, to get my job done. I remember
                    going into the Ministry of Health, in this military government, and I'd deal
                    with, let's say, the advisor to the deputy minister. The deputy minister was a
                    Korean, but the advisor was the guy you talked to, because we were running the
                    place. And so I'd say, “The Ford Foundation is planning to give medical
                    scholarships here; however, we want to know the level of medical education of
                    all the doctors in the country.” I wanted help to make up a proper form, both in
                    English and in Korean, that would give me that data. Then I asked it sent all
                    over the country, filled out, and returned. With the police force, it was a
                    similar approach. With the military, it was a different form; everyone was given
                    a different story.</p>
                <p>The only person who ever questioned me, who ever said, “Hey, is there any truth
                    in what you're telling me?”, was the colonel who was the advisor to the military
                    - the Korean Constabulary, they called it. He wanted to know who the hell I
                    really was. So I gave him Mr. Sergeant's number, and he called Sergeant up. And
                    after he got it straightened out with Sergeant, he agreed to go along with what
                    I was doing.</p>
                <p>I collected, in every profession, in every area, masses of files. I was then in
                    the process of getting them translated and put into some organized fashion,
                    because everything was Dewey Decimal System. I had clerks working for me.</p>
                <p>I was still a sergeant, but with a “Mister,” status; then my enlistment was up.
                    My boss said “We want you to continue here; the State Department wants you to
                    continue. State is willing to put up a P-1 slot,” (which was the lowest
                    professional grade) “for you to become a professional here.” So I took a
                    discharge. But I had to get my parents' permission, because I still wasn't 21. I
                    became a P-1 in the State Department and continued to do just what I'd done.</p>
                <p>I then began to work with a man named Leonard Bertsch. He was sort of the senior
                    political officer for the command. I'd go to meetings with him with Koreans, and
                    we'd meet with people such as Kim Kyu-sik, Kim Ku and other leaders of the
                    Korean Independence movement. I'd listen. We had interpreters, because neither
                    one of us spoke any Korean, to speak of. Bertsch was a Holy Cross/Harvard Law
                    graduate, who'd arrived in Korea in either late 1945 or early '46 and had been
                    with the Commission from the beginning. He was the action officer for the State
                    Department on what had then been the policy of supporting the coalition effort
                    for a coalition government. This effort was very anti-Rhee. Rhee was considered
                    a right-wing extremist, and the State Department looked on him that way. Now
                    Hodge didn't. Hodge was a very right-wing guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was General Hodge.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>THOMAS: General Hodge, yes. “Hodgie, Bertschie, Lurchie” they used to say. Hodge
                    was the commanding general of XXIV Corps, a lieutenant general; Lurch was the
                    military governor of Korea, a major general; and Bertsch was a first lieutenant.
                    He was later a P-5; he took a discharge there. He was the guy who was managing
                    this whole coalition effort. I got to meet many Koreans, moving around with him,
                    during my last six months there; that's after I became a civilian and worked
                    with him.</p>
                <p>But the whole thing blew up. After that article by George Kennan in Foreign
                    Affairs under the pseudonym, Mr. X, Sources of Soviet Conduct, you could just
                    feel it in the Commission; you could feel there was this complete change in
                    attitude about this whole effort of ours to work with the left and to try to get
                    the left and the right to work together for a unified Korea. We'd been trying to
                    do this.</p>
                <p>Somebody had to be the scapegoat for this change in policy. Bertsch was very
                    bright, but also irritated the hell out of some of these older officers, who
                    couldn't keep up with him. He had a photographic memory. He'd read something and
                    he'd remember it. Anyway, he ended up having to take the fall for this coalition
                    effort. By then, they had closed the Commission down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the Soviet...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission. And they'd pulled those of us who were over
                    at the Soviet Commission, who had been with Political Advisory Group, the few of
                    us who were left. Sergeant had left there by then. Most of them had gone back to
                    the States, gotten out of the military, that type of thing. I was given a desk
                    in the G2 bullpen, along with all these lieutenant colonels. Bertsch was made my
                    assistant. They were really going to knock him down, until they could ship him
                    out of there. So, for about three weeks, he ended up working for me. It was very
                    degrading, because I felt he was a first-class man and what they were doing to
                    him was unfair. He was being accused of mollycoddling Communists and all of
                    this. There was an awful lot of corruption going on among some of the officers
                    there, stories that you heard within the intelligence community. There was a
                    fellow named Goodfellow, who'd gotten in trouble. Even the CIC was selling stuff
                    on the black market to obtain extra-operational funds. This spilled over and had
                    a detrimental effect on intelligence operations that were going on at that time.
                    They tried to implicate him in currency exchange corruption.</p>

                <p>But it was years later that some Koreans talked to me about Bertsch and those
                    meetings. I was asked to do some research about this period. The grant that was
                    to come from Korea University suddenly was cancelled because a new dean had been
                    appointed. I just didn't have the money to go running around without some
                    support. Bertsch's widow offered to let me see all of the personal letters that
                    he'd written about that period to her, which nobody had ever seen. They
                    concerned the first year of the Joint Commission and all his efforts working
                    with the Korean political leaders who were on the Coalition Committee. Maybe
                    later, when there are fewer financial demands on family resources, I will be
                    able to do this on my own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling, in your position, while you were
                        working with the Joint Soviet- American Commission? How did you feel about
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Well, I felt that it was a very frustrating thing. The Soviets were not
                    about to compromise. That was very obvious. This was all an exercise in
                    futility. I felt we were dealing with people, as a country, that were much more
                    sophisticated, in terms of double dealing and all these things that were going
                    on, than we were. Compared to both the Soviets and the Koreans, who'd lived
                    through the Korean provisional government, where they were killing each other
                    and fighting the Japanese through assassination and all this, we were sort of
                    babes in the woods. I felt this, in terms of most of the things we attempted.
                    And a lot of the information we were obtaining was colored by our own
                    perceptions of what Asia was.</p>
                <p>I can still remember the night of the Korean election to elect the National
                    Assembly of Korea. It was to be overseen by the U.N. All American troops were
                    under curfew; they weren't allowed out. I was put on detail to UNTCOK to observe
                    that election. There was this group of people including UNTCOK delegates and
                    staff that was allowed to act as observers; I was one of the observers. There
                    were an awful lot of shootings and fighting at the polls. But the election went
                    off. And it was a very adventurous day for me.</p>
                <p>That evening, I went to an early-evening movie. Because Jeeps were stolen, we had
                    a parking lot that was guarded; my Jeep was parked in a parking lot. As I was
                    going to get it, the lights of a car flashed on a man whose face was bloody and
                    he was staggering. His coat flew open, and here was an American .45 hanging on a
                    lanyard underneath his coat. I knew civilian Koreans (he wasn't in the military)
                    weren't supposed to be armed. I wasn't armed, but I started to follow him. We
                    went down one of these little back alleys, where it was blacker than hell. I
                    could hear the click of this thing. When it stopped clicking, I'd stop. Every
                    time I did, I backed against the wall. One time, I backed into somebody. And it
                    was a policeman back in there.</p>
                <p>By the time we got things straightened out (he spoke some English, I spoke
                    practically no Korean), we went to a police station outside of there. There was
                    somebody there who spoke good English, and I explained what I'd seen. So we all
                    went back together.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>I can still remember being back in there. They gave me a pistol. On the ground,
                    they'd found this guy hidden behind a log with his pistol. In the end, they
                    talked him into backing out. He came out with his hands up, and they hit him. I
                    never saw somebody beaten up so badly in my life. I felt sick about it. They
                    took him to the police station.</p>
                <p>The next morning, I can still remember, Colonel Watlington, who was the G2,
                    calling me in and saying, “Well, we got somebody out there doing his own
                    arresting. You shouldn't be doing this type thing. You'll get yourself
                    hurt.”</p>
                <p>But I can still remember that was the election day, that first election. There
                    were a lot of problems on both sides. I couldn't say it was a completely fair
                    election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm speaking as a former enlisted man, too, and I know
                        there are guys who do nothing but just horse around and have a good time.
                        But there are also the ones who are sort of observing things around them and
                        all. And you were with a group that was doing that. What was the impression
                        of the men and the officers of General Hodge and his rule at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: A lot of the people I was moving with were what you'd call the bright
                    guys. The enlisted men in a headquarters engineering battalion had to be
                    somewhat educated even to be there except for the truck drivers. The
                    professional people at the Commission were all very bright. Among the troops I
                    was living with, you had the band living out there, but I didn't get to know
                    them. You had one or two other people who had come for the same reason I'd come,
                    with high AGC scores.</p>
                <p>One fellow, Charles (Chuck) Allen, was out of Swarthmore. His father was a
                    medical doctor in Swarthmore, Pa. He was assigned to write the nightly
                    intelligence newsletter for the top officials, the general officers, that came
                    out early every morning. He had access to all the intelligence going on in
                    Korea, everything. He was a liberal guy, and he saw an awful lot of this as
                    being crap, as being unfair. You know, right-wing extremism. He felt some of
                    these people we'd thrown in jail were being falsely accused, and he didn't like
                    it; so he started writing letters to these people in these jails down in
                    southern part of Korea. Suddenly, when the authorities realized this guy, Allen,
                    who was responsible for writing and had access to all the top secret stuff, was
                    the author of these letters, they canned him. Allen was not happy with the Osu
                    Rebellion and all those things that went on at the time and how it was
                    handled.</p>
                <p>I got to know people who were working in the information and the education end of
                    the command, they were soldiers who worked for STARS &amp; STRIPES. Someone in
                    the U of Maryland program there asked me to teach a course in analytical
                    geometry which I did for one semester. Fellows such as these were in the
                    educational program. Therefore they were much more liberal in their outlook.
                    They didn't think too much of Hodge and the whole approach to how we were
                    handling Korea or the Koreans.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know, when Hodge first came in, it was said he sort of
                        brushed aside the Koreans and went to the Japanese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: What he did was to go to the people who spoke some English; he went to
                    the extreme right-wing landlords who'd participated and worked along with the
                    Japanese. He looked on them as being Western educated and they could do the most
                    good.</p>
                <p>The people who'd fought for Korean independence and who'd been in all types of
                    troubles (such as a man named Cho Pong-am, with whom I later got very much
                    involved; he'd been in prison and been tortured by the Japanese; he became the
                    first minister of agriculture in the first Rhee government in 1948 and later ran
                    against Rhee; I was the American who had the closest relationship with him),
                    were not asked for anything or talked to any extent.</p>
                <p>The only time we were involved with those types of people was this
                    Coalition-Committee effort on the part of Bertsch, where I got to know Kim Ku.
                    If you know the history of Korea, Kim Ku was a revolutionary who planned the
                    assassination of one of the Japanese princes, by his assassination squads in
                    Shanghai. Kim Kyu-sik was a gentleman-scholar type who was sort of the scholarly
                    Confucian who headed the Coalition Committee. And then you had Yo Ung-hyong, who
                    was another one of the leaders who was somewhat left and a scholar anti-Japanese
                    type. They were all in this thing called the Coalition Committee. Kim Ku and Yo
                    Ung-hyong were both assassinated with Rhee's sponsorship.</p>
                <p>When the Coalition Committee was ended, when Bertsch and that whole effort was
                    shot down, that effort, (which the State Department had been pushing up until
                    then) went out the window, Bertsch took the fall.</p>
                <p>I was just young enough and junior enough that I didn't get hurt in all this. But
                    I could see people above me who were getting hurt, and very unfairly hurt. And
                    this went on for years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a part of this group assembling this biographic
                        data.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I was the head of that group. Sergeant ran the whole political
                    intelligence effort of which this project was just one part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the status, at this very
                        important period, the post-World War II, the de-occupation of Korea by the
                        Japanese and all, of the educational situation in Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>THOMAS: Well, that's a very interesting and excellent question. Out of my
                    experience there (and not just out of this first tour there, but I was there a
                    good many years over the period, off and on until '59), I came to the conclusion
                    that the Japanese, as imperialists, were really probably better in some ways
                    than the Brits, the French, or the Dutch, for this fundamental reason: they took
                    all the good jobs for themselves—the president of this, the president of that,
                    the head of the bank, but they also felt that if Korea and Taiwan were to be
                    properly exploited, you had to have an educated work force. So they pushed basic
                    education. That, along with the Confucian value system that pushed education,
                    made it so that the Koreans, when we went in there, had a 90-percent literacy
                    rate. This was true also, I understand, in Taiwan. With that as a background,
                    even though these people didn't have experience as head of the bank, you could
                    create leaders more quickly in that situation. Whereas, in India, where I later
                    served, you had a few top people and then the rest; the few at the top became
                    the new domestic imperialists which creates a wholly different situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A very, very interesting insight into that. Our
                        intelligence, at least the part you were dealing with, where was it focused?
                        Was it on what was happening within South Korean ranks, or were we looking
                        at North Korea? What were we looking at?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: It was my impression that we were at the most basic level of trying to
                    understand Korea and the Koreans. That is why I was involved in the more
                    bureaucratic aspect of assembling this basic form of data. It took some doing,
                    and it took a lot of organization, a lot of forms and a lot of time getting them
                    printed. I knew I didn't know the right questions to ask for a doctor's form,
                    but I knew where to go to get it. So I was managing this thing.</p>
                <p>Along with this (because that got to be dull at times), I was going with Bertsch
                    to these meetings and listening to all this stuff. I would be reading all the
                    latest minutes from what was happening, and the fights over the political
                    parties and whom we were going to recognize as a political party, and the
                    registration of political parties.</p>
                <p>You can say the whole period there, in terms of what I was doing, was a mixture
                    of things, with biographic form collection as my base. But people would come to
                    me and say, “Can you find out...” I remember a lieutenant colonel of military
                    intelligence (MI) coming to me and saying, “I hear you have a connection into
                    Khabarovsk, Siberia. Can you find out so and so.” Well, my connection there was
                    a connection with a Korean, whom I knew, had some connections there. So I went
                    and threw the question at him. I don't know how he got his answer, but he got me
                    an answer. It was that type thing. So, in time, you got to know people, and
                    people got to know you.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>After this many years, I don't remember the names of some of these people. I can
                    remember some of the people who were on the Commission, like Monegan and Paul
                    Sturm, who was a Foreign Service officer. Some of them were economists, some of
                    them political types. Some of them had been with OSS, but they'd previously been
                    with the Foreign Service or State. So you had a real mixture, a mixed bag.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about north of the 38th Parallel at that time, was
                        that completely cut off?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: No, we had an operation running there, a big operation, being run by a
                    Colonel Ko</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A Korean colonel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: He was running this for G2 XXIV Corps, in terms of order of battle. He
                    had a whole slew of agents, and this thing developed over the years. But it was
                    going back then, and I knew about it. And it was probably the most effective
                    low-level-order of battle intelligence operation going.</p>
                <p>Now the highest-level thing going that I got wind of... And I didn't get wind of
                    this in terms of North Korea. Some of this, it's hard for me, in telling
                    stories, to keep it all exactly chronological. But this happened in a period
                    that I wasn't there. You see, I left right before the government was formed.
                    After the election, I was offered a job in our embassy, but I came back to go
                    back to school. But after the government was formed and the first cabinet
                    appointed (and this has to do with North Korea, because you asked about North
                    Korea), Rhee was looking around for people who had the capability to be cabinet
                    ministers. He had a limited number of educated people to call on. One of the
                    people he'd heard about was a captain in the British Royal Navy(Reserve),
                    Captain Shin Song-mo, who had commanded merchant ships, but under military
                    control, during World War II. Of course, how many Koreans get to be a captain in
                    the British Navy, even as a reserve? So the word got back, somehow, I think,
                    through the British Embassy, that they had this captain who was an educated man.
                    And then they had another man who was educated, named Yi Kuk-no, who had been to
                    school in England, I think to the London School of Economics. And they might be
                    helpful to the Korean government in forming a new government.</p>
                <p>In my research on what was happening, after I got back there in '52, I started
                    noticing that Shin Song-mo was no longer in the cabinet, but he had been the
                    second minister of defense, just as the war was breaking out. There were all
                    sorts of stuff in the files, and from people I talked to, about the fact that
                    he'd been accused of corruption in smuggling between North and South Korea.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>When I started looking a little deeper, I found out that he'd been on a ship
                    coming out and had bragged he was working for MI6, British intelligence. Here he
                    was no longer anything, but he was still around there. While reading these older
                    files that we had in the embassy, most of which we'd gotten from US CIC, and
                    trying to fit pieces together in terms of what had happened while I was away, in
                    terms of cabinet personalities, the files indicated that this friend of his, Yi
                    Kuk-no, who had been mentioned by the British, instead of coming south to help
                    in the government, had gone north. And he became minister without portfolio in
                    the North Korean government.</p>
                <p>It also was strange to me to find that the two ends of this smuggling route, one
                    had Yi Kuk-no on it, and the other had Shin Song-mo, the defense minister. So I
                    started thinking double-think. I thought there might be more to this than just
                    smuggling, especially since MI6 is maybe involved here. There were some files
                    that indicated that Shin Song-mo had been warning the command and everybody else
                    that there was a war coming with North Korea.</p>
                <p>After I retired, I went to the Archives and pulled some files on Shin Song-mo
                    because some of that stuff had been declassified. These files clearly indicated
                    that Shin was predicting the coming of the war constantly during the spring of
                    1950. Embassy reporting indicated this fact. However, much of it was discounted
                    as scare tactics to obtain more military aid. My guess is that if we were to
                    just try to find out where we had the hardest information that said a war was
                    coming we should look at what we were obtaining from the British from their
                    clandestine sources via CIA liaison with them. Because, as I've learned since,
                    the Armed Forces Security Agency failed to predict the Korean War. I was the
                    first one at the Archives after they opened these files, and they showed them to
                    me. They said, “We just opened this stuff up, so you can see it.” And they gave
                    me these documents that showed that NSA was created because of the failure of
                    ASA. And the failure of ASA was that nobody was allowed to put any requirements
                    on them but the military. We, in the State Department, had been saying, “Look,
                    Korea is a problem.” But they weren't listening. If they had been listening to
                    their radios out there, they'd have known this thing was coming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the security agency, the people who
                        eavesdrop on communications, essentially, and decoding...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Sure. But you can tell a war is coming if you're told to do it and you're
                    doing it in any depth, because you get tactical stuff. They knew what was wrong,
                    and that was why, in these documents NSA was set up. They said, “You boys
                    failed, and the State Department wanted you to do this.” When they set NSA up,
                    State became one of the organizations which could place requirements on NSA.
                    This change came out of the Korean War.</p>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>THOMAS: I went back home. Because I wanted to get away from home, I applied to
                    Princeton and was accepted. But then I realized my father had three other
                    children in school. Since I had the GI Bill and if I went to Bucknell, which was
                    in my hometown, I could afford to join a fraternity and have some spending
                    money, but if I went to Princeton, I'd be the poor boy. So I decided I'd rather
                    be better off, and I stayed at home and went through Bucknell where I received a
                    degree in electrical engineering. I was, frankly, a bit bored with it all. But,
                    because my father had been in the military, I joined what was called the PLCs. I
                    don't know if you ever heard of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Well, that's the Marine Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that's the Platoon Leadership Course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: So I went through that program and was to be commissioned a second
                    lieutenant of Marines when I got my degree. You had to have your degree to get
                    your commission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got your degree when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Well, I was due to get it in June of '51.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was high Korean War.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I was at Quantico when the war broke out, summer 1950, in the Marine
                    Corps for my PLC training. And I remember the colonel there, hearing about me
                    and my Dad, said, “We're thinking of starting a horse Marine to go to Korea.
                    Would you be interested in a horse Marine regiment?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Sure, but, you know...”</p>
                <p>They were just starting to fool around with helicopters at this point.</p>
                <p>I came back from that Marine assignment that summer, and it was in the fall of
                    that year I got a letter from Douglas Heck, who was chief of the biographic unit
                    in INR in State and later ambassador to Nepal, I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He just recently died.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I got a letter from Doug Heck, who'd talked to all these people about my
                    work setting up all those biographic files and doing all that work as a P-1 in
                    State out there many years before, and he asked me down for an interview. Well,
                    I came down here; he wanted me to quit right away and go to Korea. Well, I
                    didn't have my degree, and my father said, “Hell, no, you've got to get a
                    degree.”</p>
                <p>I went back and talked to the president of Bucknell, a fellow named Hildreth, who
                    later was ambassador to Pakistan, and he said, “If I were you, young man, I'd
                    just quit college and go take that job.”</p>
                <p>But Heck said, “Well, we'll try to hold it for you.”</p>
                <p>So I went back to Bucknell and was finishing out, when a strange thing happened.
                    I took a final exam in a course called Transient in Electrical Circuits. This
                    was a high-level mathematical course, where you had to solve using differential
                    equations, heavy-sides methods, and Laplacian transformations. You had to solve
                    these problems that you ran into in the laboratory situation, all three ways,
                    and turn them in.</p>
                <p>The lab instructor in this course was in the same church as my father but he
                    hated my father and my father hated him. Professor Miller was very disliked on
                    the campus.</p>
                <p>I was loaning my lab reports to a physics major, who was taking his master's
                    degree in physics at Bucknell. All this mathematics he'd never had, and he was
                    having a hell of a time, so I just loaned him my papers; he was copying my lab
                    reports. Well, he was getting “A's” and I was getting “D's”, on the same
                    reports. I could see this, but I couldn't tell, because I'd ruin the other
                    guy's... So that was that.</p>
                <p>Anyway, on the final exam for this course, which was not a take-home, you had to
                    do it there, and it was under high-pressure speed, I solved the problems. Two of
                    them, I jumped a lot of places to come up with my answers. I did it in my head,
                    and I came down here and came up with the right answer. But the professor didn't
                    want to believe that I had. He figured I'd copied this from somebody, because
                    there were chunks missing. But it was a matter of speed. So he gave me a
                    flunking grade. I argued with him but he said, “The grades are already in. You
                    flunked.” And you had to have this course to graduate. When I showed him how I'd
                    done this, mentally, he still said, “Okay, I made a mistake, that's too bad, but
                    that's that. I'm not going to do anything about that guy who gave you these bad
                    lab grades.” It was crap.</p>
                <p>Well, as a matter of fact, it ended up with a hell of a big fight, with people
                    going to the president of the university on my behalf.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>But, anyway, as someone later put it, it was a blessing in disguise. I was due to
                    be commissioned a Marine lieutenant, but I couldn't be commissioned because I
                    didn't have my degree. I went down to Drexel, which was an engineering school in
                    Philadelphia, and took the same course, Transient in Electrical Circuits, and
                    got an “A”.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, I was in touch with Heck. Heck said, “We've still got this job
                    slot for you in Korea.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I've got the Marine Corps on my back.”</p>
                <p>He said, “I think we can handle that. Since you're going to Korea, I think we can
                    handle it.”</p>
                <p>In the end, there was an argument, but the Marine Corps wrote me and said we
                    understand you're going to Korea with the State Department, and that they have a
                    more important job for you.</p>
                <p>So I ended up with that job rather than being commissioned a second lieutenant.
                    In a few months, I was taking training here in Washington. While I was in my
                    training course to get ready to go abroad, they wrote a letter and asked me to
                    resign my commission because they couldn't call me to active duty. So I ended up
                    being a non-Marine at that point.</p>
                <p>I was shipped off to Korea as a staff officer, and I didn't know the difference.
                    The State Department was always sort of Greek to me. I knew what these “P”
                    ratings were, but I got to Korea and assumed I was no different from these young
                    officers who were all FSOs but some of them weren't about to give me the time of
                    day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got to Korea when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I got to Korea in May 1952. I'd been told here in the Department that
                    Muccio soon would be transferred out of there but it wasn't known there
                    publically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time, the embassy was back in Seoul.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: No, it was in Pusan, Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But we held Seoul, didn't we?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>THOMAS: We'd gone back in. We'd lost Seoul, but had gone back into Seoul. But we
                    weren't back in there as an embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was stationed, as an airman second class, at Yangtze
                        University. I was with the Air Force Security Service, a Russian
                        monitor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Is that right? Well, then, having been with that, you might want to read
                    those papers I saw, because they talk about that's how the NSA got started. It
                    was because of the fact that they weren't listening for that, before the
                    war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were working in Pusan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I was the biographic officer, because that's why they'd hired me. I set
                    up the biographic files, plus I did domestic political work. We had a chief of
                    political section named Rolland Bushner. Did you know Rolland at all?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Well, Rolland was a first-class officer, but he resigned later and went
                    with FOREIGN AFFAIRS magazine. We didn't have any American women in Pusan when I
                    first got there; it was terrible. There were no women clerks; you couldn't find
                    anything in the file room. It was a mess. The embassy was in an old bank
                    building. Lightner, who was the DCM, was a breath of fresh air compared to
                    Muccio. Muccio was dour, in a way. I tried to make a joke the first day I
                    arrived, and he said, “Well, if you don't like it here, get on an airplane.” It
                    was just a joke. But he wasn't there that long until he was called back for a
                    consultation.</p>
                <p>I got there about May 20th. We were in the middle, or soon thereafter, of one of
                    the biggest political crises that had ever occurred, in terms of President Rhee
                    wanting to make sure he got reelected president of Korea. Soon thereafter, we
                    put Chang Myon on a hospital ship, to hide him from Rhee's goons. We were
                    manipulating a great many things. I was involved in this, with the rest of the
                    political section.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>First of all, let me tell you, the political section was made up of, I think,
                    four or five officers. I'd been hired because I knew something about politics
                    there and people in the Department talking about my moving around with Bertsch
                    and the Coalition Committee. So I knew some people there, and I knew my way
                    around. This place didn't floor me. They had a fellow named Walter Drew, who
                    would read newspapers all the day long, translations of newspapers, and then
                    write up political stuff. It was pretty dull stuff, but he wrote well. Although,
                    Drew had spent many years in Korea from MG days, he was very introverted and
                    didn't get to know people. Another officer was Phil Manhard, who was a
                    first-class collector and people person. He and I hit it off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had just, not too long before, been in Shandong.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: That's right, and he was a Chinese-language officer. He'd been down on
                    Koji-do, or one of those islands, with a general, looking after the Chinese
                    prisoners of war. But he and I became sort of buddies in the political
                    section.</p>
                <p>I shared a house with the head of the economic section, a fellow named Gordon
                    Strong, who was a State officer and the labor attach�'.</p>
                <p>It became pretty obvious to me that there was a group of women there called the
                    Nak Nong Club, which was basically an intelligence organization being run by
                    Rhee's people. These were grass widows, upper-class types.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Korean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Koreans, who were sort of sicced on lonely American senior officers.
                    Gordon Strong had a live-in girlfriend, who spoke pretty good English, and he
                    was telling her everything that went on in that embassy, every night.</p>
                <p>I reported this to Lightner. From then on, at our staff meetings, nothing of
                    importance was discussed. Then there would be a rump staff meeting, with
                    Bushner, Lightner, Drew, Manhard, and myself, around Lightner's desk. We only
                    had one staff room we could all get into. If you went in there, everybody knew
                    it. So the only way you could have a meeting without the rest of the embassy
                    realizing you were having a meeting was to go up to Lightner's office, which was
                    next door to the ambassador's. By then, I think he had taken over as charg� and
                    taken over what had been the ambassador's office, which was no great shakes
                    either.</p>
                <p>But that's how we ran the place. We each had assignments, picking up stuff. I
                    would be out talking to people. I knew some military officers that I'd gotten to
                    know before, both in the Navy and in the Army.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about Koreans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Koreans, yes. And politicians I'd gotten to know.</p>
                <p>I can still remember a funny story, if funny stories have their place in this. I
                    was out one night, and I had a Jeep station wagon I'd taken out there so I could
                    get around. With me was the labor attach�, and we were out visiting a Korean
                    politician in the National Assembly. It was out in one of these back districts
                    where you had to crawl up a mountainside and go into a shack, because that's the
                    way everybody was living. I'd parked my car down here, but on the telephone
                    poles were these big signs, in yellow, saying: OFF LIMITS DISTRICT. NO AMERICAN
                    TROOPS. Since it was raining hard, I said, “No sense both of us getting wet.”
                    Our car was parked where it was somewhat protected; I pulled up and parked right
                    below this area to wait for him to come down. As I sat there, parked, there was
                    a bang on my window. I looked up and there was a big burly American MP sergeant
                    who said, “Don't you know you don't belong here? This is off limits.”</p>
                <p>I looked at him and I said, “I don't think you understand, sergeant. You have no
                    jurisdiction. I enjoy diplomatic immunity.”</p>
                <p>He looked at me for a few moments, and said, “I don't give a damn when you got
                    your shots. Get the hell out of here.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Rhee government sitting
                        down in Pusan? By this time, in the summer of '52, essentially South Korea
                        was as South Korea is today, although the country was devastated, the
                        embassy was in Pusan, and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: The embassy was very anti-Rhee, the whole group of us were; Muccio hadn't
                    been. Muccio had gone with Rhee out of Seoul, he and MacDonald and a few other
                    officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Donald MacDonald.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>THOMAS: Yes, we were friends. (He was one of the best Korean specialists in the
                    service, and a very fine man. He should have been made ambassador there.) They'd
                    gotten out of Seoul and stuck together. So they'd been through the hard times
                    together, with this fellow Shin Song-mo, the then defense minister, whom I was
                    talking about, and many in the cabinet, they all went south. They suffered
                    together, so there was a certain amount of camaraderie there. But Muccio was
                    pulled out of Korea and sent back to the States. He'd been trying to protect
                    Rhee and had done everything he could, but Rhee misread what was going on. Rhee
                    felt that Muccio had done him in, and went after him, using money, because Rhee
                    understood the system of using money with politicians in the U.S. Congress. He
                    had his connections with the extreme right wing of the American government,
                    including Stiles Bridges and others. Many of these names I don't remember
                    anymore, because we're talking a long time ago. But at the time, I knew pretty
                    much. There were people I knew of at that time within the government whose names
                    I don't remember now.</p>
                <p>Let me preface this, in terms of my approach to a country like Korea. If you paid
                    for much information, you really didn't get what you really wanted. You had a
                    lot of intelligence agencies there, of all numbers and stripes, collecting
                    information, most of them buying it. I could go into war stories about various
                    ones and stupid things. I'll give you one as an example a little later.</p>
                <p>Anyway, because of this, I came to the conclusion that most of what they were
                    furnishing was either concocted or was manipulated, because these people were
                    much more used to manipulating others, in terms of the type things they'd been
                    involved in, especially Rhee. Rhee was manipulating our government back here. I
                    was trying to find out all I could about that, for my own protection and our
                    embassy's protection, because I knew that we weren't going to be popular due to
                    the fact that we were not siding with him in this fight with the National
                    Assembly. That was very obvious.</p>
                <p>Rhee suddenly turned to a person named Lee Bum Suk. Lee Bum Suk was a Korean
                    general in Sian China who had been commander of Kwangbok Army under the OSS,
                    Eagle Project, I think it was called, in China, which had a youth corps
                    connected to it.(Later known as the Northwest Youth Corps. He had been the first
                    minister of defense in the Rhee government.) The Kwangbok Army had worked with
                    our OSS against the Japanese. Clyde Sergeant, my boss in the Political Advisory
                    Group, had been the American OSS officer in charge in Sian. I had gotten to know
                    Lee Bum Suk through Clyde Sergeant back when I'd been there in '48, and I knew
                    his background. He was another Chiang Kai-shek, sort of what I call a Christian
                    fascist. You know that type? He was very straight and reminded you of Chiang
                    Kai-shek, very military in his bearing and very black and white. Well, he was
                    brought in to be the hatchet man for Rhee.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>The National Assembly, in the past, had elected the president. The president, by
                    this time, had come to the conclusion that there was not going to be any
                    presidency for him if he had to depend upon that damn National Assembly. So he'd
                    better get the constitution changed to make it a popular election for president.
                    The whole issue was to change the constitution. This took a good many votes, a
                    lot of arm twisting and bully-boy tactics. We were trying to protect the
                    majority of the members of the National Assembly, including Chang Myon and
                    others that we considered democrats, against this pressure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I was trying to put out my basic theory in terms of how you got decent
                    information. We had all this stuff coming in from every intelligence agency, but
                    it was all paid for. In a country as poor as Korea, you could hire anybody.
                    Agents for intelligence services were cheap, and you could have hundreds of
                    them, but it didn't mean you were learning anything of any importance. So I
                    decided that the best thing to do was to read their stuff with a grain of salt,
                    but to really get to know the players as best I could, and get to know people
                    around the players, who would have reason to truly know what they were talking
                    about.</p>
                <p>I soon realized that, in a place like Korea, there's a loyalty on the part of the
                    Koreans to Korea. But there is no loyalty to a government. Governments come and
                    go, and it's politics. So if you could get the Korean you were dealing with to
                    feel that your interests were the same as his, as it related to country, but
                    maybe not the government in power, you could learn a hell of a lot, and they'd
                    tell you anything you wanted to know. So this was the approach I took.</p>
                <p>Most Americans equate government and country. Therefore, if you feel that way,
                    you'd treat a guy who was telling you things out of school as a traitor. But you
                    just can't do that. If you do that, you're hobbling yourself, and that's not the
                    truth of the matter. I mean, who in the hell could be, in a big way, loyal to
                    Mr. Rhee, except a few of the hangers on of Mr. Rhee?</p>
                <p>Out of all this, I wanted to find out what he was up to, so I got people who were
                    on his staff, male secretaries on his staff, I got to know people in
                    politics.</p>
                <p>I didn't mess with the Foreign Office. I soon realized that the Foreign Office
                    was not in the power loop.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's so often the case, in many countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>THOMAS: And yet I couldn't convince my fellow Foreign Service officers who were
                    used to that. They thought they'd deal with the American desk chief. I remember
                    Bill Jones; I had trouble trying to convince him. He later became chief of the
                    political section, and he wouldn't listen to me. He was a State officer who came
                    out there, first post.</p>
                <p>I used to say to anybody who wanted to know anything about Korea, “You don't deal
                    with the ambassador from Korea, ever, if you really want to know what's going
                    on, in terms of a feedback from their own government. The guy who counts is the
                    DCM. The DCM got his job because Rhee put him there to keep an eye on the
                    ambassador. The ambassador is a Foreign Office front man to go to parties, but
                    he doesn't have the power.” This was the way that government operated. I could
                    talk to a guy like Manhard, because he understood this. But you'd go to a lot of
                    these people who came out of Europe, they didn't have a clue. And it was very
                    hard to tell them.</p>
                <p>Out of all this, we were trying to protect ourselves. So I was getting
                    information from talking to various people (it was so long ago, I don't remember
                    who). But I was getting a good deal of information on Rhee, because he was mad
                    at the embassy. He was mad at Muccio because he thought Muccio was screwing him
                    back here. Muccio was not but he wasn't willing to accept that; at least that
                    wasn't what he was hearing. He was going after Muccio and going after us; I was
                    collecting all the data I could on that. And it was all sensitive, because we're
                    talking about American politics, and money going to American politicians, and
                    who and what and when.</p>
                <p>When I got it all together, there was a chief of political section there, named
                    Rolland Bushner, and he and I got along great, because I'd pointed out to
                    Rolland that... in his political section, for my money, was... because my
                    function was basically the biographic function and to get all this data on
                    people together and to find out what was happening and to also liaise with the
                    intelligence organizations that were there, for the embassy, like INR does it
                    back here. I'd go to the CIC chief and talk to him, get their stuff, and they'd
                    send stuff over, and the military intelligence people, and the CIA had a big
                    station there, and they'd send stuff over, and NSA people would come in with
                    their little satchel. It was ASA in those days, but still war period.</p>
                <p>Anyway, out of all this, we got to know an awful lot about what was happening.
                    And if you knew who you were talking to and could sort of cull this information,
                    cull the good from the bad, you could come up with a reasonable picture.</p>
                <p>But just at this point, we got a new DCM and ambassador. He took a dislike,
                    immediately, to the chief of the political section, Bushner. Bushner could feel
                    it, and so could I. He didn't take a dislike to me, but he took a dislike to
                    Bushner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The new ambassador was Ellis O. Briggs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>THOMAS: Yes, and the new DCM was Niles Bond. Briggs seemed to like me, but it was
                    still too early to know. But we could feel that we were going to get a new
                    political chief, even though Bushner hadn't been there that long.</p>
                <p>So I said to Bushner, “What are we going to do with all this information?”</p>
                <p>He said, “You know we're not going to get it by Briggs. He's not going to want to
                    put all this stuff down and send it in. But you know you've got the right, as
                    biographic officer, to send biographic reports. And nobody even bothers to read
                    them.”</p>
                <p>So we sat down and put all this data in a biographic format, using the names of
                    people. But it was really what was going on there, including who was buying whom
                    and where the money was going and all this. An update on Rhee, an update on this
                    guy, anybody who was involved, in a batch of these biographic reports. We got it
                    all typed up, and I made up an INR pouch, directly to INR, for this stuff.
                    Didn't even take it to the ambassador—it's just biographic reports. And we
                    shipped it all out. Didn't say a word.</p>
                <p>Within two weeks of getting it all out of there, Bushner was out of there
                    himself. As we were going to the airport, he was dictating to me the last of
                    this stuff that he knew, so I could use it later.</p>
                <p>Anyway, it got to Washington. And Bushner, in the meantime, who was better known
                    (because this was my first post and I didn't know my way around Washington, to
                    speak of), wrote somebody in the Department that he knew, saying, “Go over and
                    get your hands on those bio reports at INR.” Well, they went over to INR, which
                    I think was in Annex I, that brick building on the corner there, and got in. The
                    reports were Top Secret, but they got to them. Well, here all this data was. It
                    told exactly how they were going after Muccio, etc., and this stuff was put
                    away. This will come up later in my story. That's the reason I tell it, because
                    it helped save an ambassador's career later.</p>
                <p>Anyway, they kept going after Muccio, and they were after Lightner. But, a guy
                    like Rhee, didn't know who we were; we were just little lieutenants. But the
                    whole system was against him.</p>
                <p>In the end, Lee Bum Suk, using strong arm methods, was able to bully the National
                    Assembly into changing the constitution. And Rhee got reelected president.</p>
                <p>But in that election, a popular election, a man named Cho Pong-am had the
                    audacity to run against him. Cho Pong- am had been a real patriot. He'd joined
                    the Communist Party and then left the Communist Party. But all during the ''30s
                    he was thrown in jail, beaten, starved, tortured by the Japanese. He was Rhee's
                    first appointed minister of agriculture, and got himself fired for trying to
                    look after the agricultural interests of the poor farmer. Of course, they were
                    out to rob the farmer of everything they could; he fought them, so they ended up
                    getting rid of him.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>CHO Pong-am comes along in my story later. I didn't get to know him at this
                    point. I got to meet him, but I didn't get to know him. We met and talked, as
                    diplomats talked to people at parties. I can still remember the first party
                    where I met him, an UNCURK party. But it wasn't until a few years later that I
                    got to be his friend although we were acquaintances; he knew who I was, and I
                    knew who he was. That was in the summer of 1952.</p>

                <p>THOMAS: Ellis Briggs and I got to be friends. Very few Foreign Service officers
                    know how to shoot a gun; I was brought up around a cavalry post, so I could
                    hunt. And Ellis was a great hunter. He had expensive shotguns and he liked to
                    hunt. When I hunted with him, I had to dress like a gentleman, not like a... you
                    know. Anyway, I arranged for hunts for him. He had a daughter and a wife who
                    came out there. I think his daughter was sort of interested in me, and the
                    Briggs family liked me. So I was a favored fellow there with Briggs. I found his
                    daughter charming, but she didn't turn on my chemistry, so I wasn't going to get
                    involved. I'd take her out to parties and that type thing. He liked to drink
                    martinis. He'd been in Czechoslovakia, and he didn't believe in big embassies;
                    he disliked them. When he first got there, he announced that although he
                    couldn't cut the embassy , he was going to cut it his way. In other words, he
                    would create a circle of people, and the rest of the place could just float. I
                    was one of the favored few in that circle. Our staff meetings were usually held
                    at the residence. It was in Pusan; he moved to Seoul before I did. He made me
                    the political representative for our government, in Pusan, and gave me his house
                    and his chauffeured car. I was living pretty high on the hog. I had this big
                    place that was an embassy residence in Pusan for a few months, while he was in
                    Seoul. All the official guests had to come through Pusan to get to Seoul. I can
                    remember I had Bill Bullitt as a guest. Do you remember Bullitt?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, William C. Bullitt.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>THOMAS: He came through. I can still remember him. The first evening he was
                    there, I had a dinner for him and he asked me my background. I told him, and
                    you've heard it all. He said, “What are you doing in the Foreign Service? You
                    have no money. To be a Foreign Service officer, you've got to have some money.
                    You don't belong in this business.” Well, he took off one night and went to
                    Seoul on a train. When he came back, he became ill with the flu. I ended up
                    having him for a week. By the end of the week, he decided I was all right, but
                    he was a bit of a snob.</p>
                <p>Another such guest was Mrs. Robert Low Bacon, whose house is now the home of
                    DACOR. She was a lot of fun and saved a fancy table cloth, which had been used
                    at the dinner in her honor. Some red wine was spilled on it. She went to the
                    rescue with the salt shaker- she emptied it on to the stain so that it couldn't
                    set and be permanent. Later in the States, she had me to a small luncheon in
                    honor of Eisenhower's chief of staff who got in trouble over the fur coat. She
                    proposed I join the Cosmos Club and lined up a invitation to join but I wasn't a
                    joiner. She was called the Perle Mesta of the Republican Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bullitt also became sort of the darling of the right wing.
                        In fact, I've heard it said that if MacArthur had been elected president,
                        Bullitt would have been his secretary of state.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I believe that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel about how Bullitt looked at Rhee and
                        the situation in Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Oh, they were all pro Rhee. By then, the Republicans were in; the
                    Eisenhower crowd had taken over. We'd had G. David Schine and Roy Cohn come
                    through. And, boy, did that sicken me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we talk about that a little?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>THOMAS: Sure. When they came through, I can still remember Lightner calling me.
                    It was Sunday. By then, something had happened and I'd moved out to a place
                    called Hialeah Compound. We were still in Pusan, Briggs hadn't arrived yet, and
                    Lightner was still charg�. This whole thing was on against homosexuals and
                    corruption in the system, but basically it was big on “going after”individuals.
                    I got this call asking me and the consul, Charlie Borell to come in and could
                    the consul come in (the consul and I lived in the same house) for an emergency
                    staff meeting at the embassy. Charlie Borell was well connected. He was the
                    consul, but his brother had been best man at one of the Rockefeller's weddings,
                    and another one of his brothers had been chairman of General Motors. So Charlie
                    was sort of the little guy with a family that had a lot of power. Anyway, it was
                    Charlie and me. The security officer didn't live out there with us, but I
                    remember he was there. The political chief was there and the economic chief. I
                    don't think they had anybody else, because it was a meeting to talk about what
                    these guys were supposedly interested in. Well, I just wished I'd had a tape
                    recorder. Q: We're talking about Cohn and Schine.</p>
                <p>THOMAS: Yes, at this meeting, these guys sat there and told stories that just
                    sickened you. I can't remember them now, but they were so sickening, I said,
                    “Oh, for a tape recorder.” And these guys are investigating us!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean Cohn and Schine were telling stories.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: About what had happened in their previous posts. And everybody was
                    running scared. They were being given VIP treatment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were...</hi>

                        themselves.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: But I didn't know this at the time.</p>

                <p>THOMAS: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Roy Cohn became sort of a cult figure for being the

                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Yes, that's what I felt, listening to these guys. I'd hear these terrible
                    men. And we looked at each other, but nobody was going to say anything, because
                    we knew these men were there to play hatchet jobs, so we just listened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were enjoying the power of what they had done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>(In retrospect, the policies concerning homosexuals adopted by the administration
                    were terrible. Many fine and capable people were ruined by those policies. Over
                    the years, I learned of several persons, whom I had known, who were forced out
                    of the Foreign Service because they were considered a security risk. The worst
                    security risk I had observed was Gordon Strong who drank too much and told all
                    to his Korean mistress while in bed with her. Because I didn't procure
                    prostitutes along with the other young men then in Korea, I was placed under
                    surveillance by the embassy security office. When I realized what was up, I
                    invited a young pretty Korean girl to my home one evening. I kept her there late
                    looking at slides and then spirited her out of my house in a suspicious manner.
                    The surveillance of course was meant to see it all. They did and I was not
                    bothered further. Years later, after our marriage, that same security officer
                    and his wife came to dinner at our home. After dinner, when we were alone, I
                    kidded him about his false suspicions.)</p>
                <p>THOMAS: Their power. And all I hoped for was a tape recorder.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>A story I forget to tell you in terms of this, because of what was happening, is
                    the corruption had gotten worse. At this time we were negotiating an economic
                    agreement. I was not a person who really took much interest in the economic
                    agreements; I had my hands full doing what my job was. But I did know that there
                    was a lot of hanky panky going on in it. I got word that there was going to be a
                    sellout of American interests at a meeting, a clandestine meeting, off the
                    record. And this came from some Koreans I had talked to. I mentioned it to
                    Lightner, and he said, “If you can find out more, do so.” Well, I found out when
                    and where this off the record meeting was to take place. This retired American
                    admiral, who had been sent out from Washington to negotiate this agreement,
                    turned out to be a very corrupt guy, one of those right-wing types. The details
                    are lost from my memory at this point. I'd gotten this from Koreans that he was
                    going to sell out the American side, and there was real, personal corruption
                    involved. This clandestine meeting was between him and a man named Paek Tu-chin
                    who was at the time the finance minister. He had been stealing us blind. It
                    involved the American AID program. The only American present would be the
                    admiral, but there would be some other people there, because this admiral didn't
                    speak Korean.</p>
                <p>Somehow or the other, somebody there had been able to get the use (and this was
                    very strange) of the kitchen of the U.N. mess hall in Hialeah compound. Around a
                    big working kitchen table, on a night that the kitchen was empty and there were
                    no cooks there. It was a summer evening, not cold or rainy, and they had these
                    steel windows that opened up. I went and planted myself outside the windows of
                    that kitchen. I lived a block away. I sat there on a little stool. It was dark
                    and nobody could see me, and I could hear what was going on inside. Once again,
                    I said, “Oh, for a tape recorder here.” In those days, you didn't have something
                    like this, you had these big things, you had to have a power source; so no
                    way.</p>
                <p>The day after hearing all this and taking a few notes, I went in to talk to
                    Lightner. And he said, “Well, it's your word against his, and you know where
                    this is going to go. If we try to say this, why, it's going to cause all hell a
                    poppin' and what have we proved.” It was terribly corrupt, and there was nothing
                    I could do. I was there alone; it was my word against this man's word.</p>
                <p>Out of that experience, Lightner decided that since I was learning things and
                    keeping him informed, I would handle any of the hot items that came along. I
                    remember one item came along that Lightner asked me to take care of, and I said,
                    “Well, why don't you ask the security chief to do this?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Because the security chief has got a problem of his own.” Which I
                    didn't know. The security chief was a bachelor and was womanizing in a big
                    way.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Anyway, it turned out that the Defense Department came to the embassy for
                    support; a cable that went directly to him which he showed me, asked the embassy
                    to look into what was wrong with the American Military Police unit in Pusan.
                    They thought something was wrong there, but they had to have outside opinion.
                    They gave some clues. They said they knew some of these people were involved
                    with an American there who was in the foreign-trading business, who had a big
                    house there and a yacht. And they gave his name and who he was.</p>
                <p>I started moseying around; I got in with the crowd and got to know him. and was
                    invited to his house. There were girlie parties pretty much every evening there.
                    And here was the whole Military Police unit, of all levels and ranks, at these
                    girlie parties, at this man's house; it went on constantly. It was a bit like a
                    nightclub, really. He was smuggling all types of stuff in and out of Korea.</p>
                <p>I wrote up my report about what I'd found and who was at these parties. I said,
                    “I can't prove anything, but it would indicate that he's got them all bought off
                    with booze and women.”</p>
                <p>The embassy suddenly got a cable, a couple of weeks later, asking me to arrange
                    for embassy trucks (we had a whole fleet of trucks there of our own) to be at
                    this military airport outside of Pusan. To tell no one, but to be there with
                    this many trucks. I got out there, and off these military aircraft came a whole
                    company of MPs, including their commanding officer. I was in a staff car, and
                    the company commander got in with me and said, “Take me to the MP headquarters.
                    We're going to arrest everybody right now, on the spot!” They turned the place
                    over, and that whole MP unit went out on the same planes, that same day. It was
                    the fastest thing I ever saw.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, back to Cohn and Schine. Besides hearing these two
                        young twerps talking about their escapades, did they come around? Did we

                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: No, they didn't want to read anything. They didn't want to look at any
                    files. They just wanted to sit around and shoot the bull for a couple of hours,
                    and then they were on their way. A complete waste of time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: All right. I was in my office the morning that happened.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was around the summer of '52.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: In the summer of '52. I was in my office one morning, and it hadn't
                    happened yet. The military attach� for Korea was a colonel named Anderson, a
                    very fine man. I liked Anderson and I'd developed a good relationship with him.
                    I'd obtained his permission to photograph his military biographic files for the
                    embassy's biographic files, so we'd have a set down there. I'd come to know him
                    when I'd go up to Taegu, because his offices were not in Pusan but in Taegu. He
                    would come down to visit regularly. He had a light plane that could take him in
                    and out, so he could get around. I had been out the night before and had talked
                    to some people I knew and had been told that this was going to happen. I was
                    weighing what letting these prisoners loose was going to do, what the
                    significance of this was.</p>
                <p>To understand the total background, right before this happened, which tipped off
                    some of us that something was going on, Rhee created a new command (The Provost
                    Marshal General Command) outside the regular command which was under the U.N.
                    commander, an American general, which meant that every military unit in Korea,
                    including the ROK Army's Military Police (ROK Army MP's guarded all prisoner of
                    war camps), was under his command. So then Rhee decided to create a new command,
                    outside of the U.N. command, which was a political command responsible only to
                    him. He appointed a man, a lieutenant general, Won Yong-dok, who was a physician
                    by training, to be the commander of this national provost marshal general
                    command, which was completely separate from the ROK (Republic of Korea) army.
                    Suddenly, with a stroke of the pen, Rhee, on one day, announced he'd transferred
                    all military police units in the ROK army to the new provost marshal general
                    command.A big fight occurred; you can't do that; we need the military police.
                    They were fighting over this issue.</p>
                <p>What he was doing was giving cover to his ROK Army MP officers, who'd be taking
                    orders from General WON.</p>
                <p>When this happened, some of my Korean friends who were involved in all this said,
                    “This is a way of getting the military police out from under the U.S. command so
                    that when they get their orders to let the prisoners go, they'll get them from
                    General Won Yong-tok, who is only responsible to Rhee. Then, when it's all over,
                    they'll transfer the military police back. But it gets this little dirty deed
                    done, and everybody's home free.”</p>
                <p>I listened to all this and thought; this is a very interesting little maneuver
                    that's going on. It was early in the morning, (ambassadors didn't come in until
                    later) and in walked Anderson into my office. My office was on the same floor as
                    the ambassador's, but down the hall. He said, “Have you heard anything about
                    this letting prisoners loose?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes, I was told that last night.”</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>I told him my story, and he told me his — the stories coincided. I said, “Let's
                    see if the ambassador's in.”</p>
                <p>We called his secretary. “Yes, he just got in.”</p>
                <p>We went down to see him, and he said, “Have you gentlemen put anything out on
                    this? Have you written a cable yet?”</p>
                <p>I said, “I haven't had time, sir. I'm telling you now because Colonel Anderson
                    came in. I was going to write a cable for you.”</p>
                <p>He said, “This is one of those things I would like to handle myself if you two
                    gentlemen don't mind.”</p>
                <p>Anderson said, “No, we don't mind. You're the ambassador.”</p>
                <p>We went on our way. We figured he'd probably report it, by his own closely held
                    channel.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, the prisoners were loose, and Washington went wild. I ran into the
                    ambassador that morning, and he winked at me and said, “Oh, the Communists
                    aren't going to do a damned thing. You watch.” He knew what he was doing. In
                    other words, we knew, but he sat on it. Brigg's analysis was right. Rhee's move
                    got those prisoners free and it solved the problem. Briggs said that communists
                    will threaten, but they're not going to block this peace agreement, and they
                    didn't. But Washington was all upset.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might add, for the researcher, that we had North Korean
                        prisoners of war. And there would been tremendous, excruciating negotiations
                        going on at P'anmunjom over how to separate the ones who wanted to come back
                        from the ones... And Rhee just opened up the gates, and almost all of them
                        ended up staying in the south. It was a fait accompli, but it was felt at
                        the time that it would blow the whole peace thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: That's right. And, of course, there was a man named Kenneth Young out
                    there, who was later an ambassador someplace else. He was deputy to the fellow,
                    I think named Arthur Dean who was sent there as the negotiating ambassador for
                    the U.N.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The negotiating man, I think, at one time, was Turner
                        Joy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>THOMAS: Oh, yes, he was a military type, but there was also a State-appointed
                    officer. Anyway, Young was his deputy, and they were there to negotiate in terms
                    of this. Young was so mad, he said to me, “You know, I've got a good mind to go
                    out to JACK and see if they can do something about...” JACK was the “Joint
                    Advisory Commission Korea”. That was the CIA unit there. He said to me, “Do you
                    know anything about JACK?”</p>
                <p>I said, “I know some of their people, because they bring intelligence into the
                    embassy. But most of their interest is in North Korea.” They had a policy where
                    their people served six months and depart. So, people rotating through every six
                    months, what the hell. They were just buying information. They didn't know what
                    they were buying.</p>
                <p>He said, “I'd like to see them get rid of Won Yong-tok.” Because Won Yong-tok had
                    done this deed. “See if we can have them blow Won Yong-tok away.”</p>
                <p>I said, “That's crazy. Won Yong-tok is not a sadist. He did what he was ordered
                    to do. The guy that did this was President Rhee. So quit blaming the action
                    agents.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel, as things developed, how Ellis
                        Briggs felt about Rhee and the political situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: First of all, he told me some war stories about his career, being sent
                    off to China and his fight with the Rockefellers. He said to me, “You've been
                    here a long time, relative to most people. You know all these...” Because I knew
                    a lot of names. I mean, when you deal with biographic, you're meeting a lot of
                    people. He said, “You know that we cannot, as a political section, do what was
                    done under Lightner. But we can do some things. I think the first thing I'd like
                    is for you personally to get to know this man Cho Pong-am.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, that's going to cost some money. I've never spent any
                    entertainment allowance. You haven't given me any. I spend my own money. Do you
                    know what a kisang party costs in this country?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kisang is equivalent to a geisha party.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: That's right. He said, “No, but you go find out.”</p>
                <p>I asked an interpreter who worked for me, to find out what a kisang party in
                    Seoul would cost.He came back with the word, “Two or three hundred dollars,”
                    which was pretty big money. I went to Briggs and said, “Can we afford two or
                    three hundred dollars?”</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>He said, “Yes, I'll get you two or three hundred dollars. You just set yourself
                    up a kisang party; I want you to get to know this Cho Pong-am who ran against
                    Rhee”.</p>
                <p>I was still living in Pusan at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be late '52ish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Late '52ish. So Mr. Shin and I went to this kisang party at a small
                    kisang house in Seoul. Present were Cho Pong-am and maybe two other people,
                    friends of his that he brought along. We just had a good drinking evening. Cho
                    Pong-am was a heavy drinker, and he could hold his liquor well. He had a great
                    sense of humor, was bright, and had courage galore. We talked about his career;
                    it was just a get-to-know-each-other evening.</p>
                <p>I went back and told Briggs what I thought of the man, and wrote up some stuff
                    for his biographic file, which is, I'm sure, in files now. I said, “Well, I'm
                    going to try to do what we can to make sure he doesn't get into any
                    trouble.”</p>
                <p>Every time something would go wrong, I would go to the head of the USIS, and I'd
                    tell him the ambassador was interested. I'd say, “I want you to interview this
                    man on Voice of America.” Nowadays we don't have Voice of America there any
                    longer. So I'd get Cho interviewed. Then they'd back off. Soon the then chief of
                    police, Cho Chi-hwan, apologized for suspecting me of tipping Cho off that they
                    planned to arrest him; he had learned that it had been one of his drivers - well
                    I had also been guilty. This was years later, after Briggs left there. But I
                    kept this up for many years, looking after him. I'd see Cho on occasion; he'd
                    see me, but not too often. He'd keep me informed of what he was doing.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>I wrote a response to a questionnaire from a Korean magazine named “MAL”(which
                    means language) of which I can furnish a copy to you. This monthly political
                    journal in Korea, two years ago, asked me if I would be willing to be
                    interviewed. I said, “Yes, on paper. I want to see the questions on paper and
                    answer them on paper.” It all had to do with my relationship with Cho Pong-am. I
                    answered the questions in English. I had been reasonably fluent in Korean, but
                    I've forgotten it all. I can't remember any Korean now. I remember Chinese now,
                    but not Korean. Anyway, I shipped it out there; some pictures they wanted, and
                    they published an article all about my, and some other people's involvement with
                    Cho Pong-am. It took a while before FBIS got around to translating it. It was
                    sent to me a year later. Of course, I read it. They made a few mistakes in what
                    I'd said. They kept calling me an intelligence officer rather than a political
                    officer. They wanted to make my relationship with Cho appear to be a clandestine
                    one. (It sells magazines!) I wasn't so worried about that as I was worried about
                    the fact that they indicated in the article that my analysis of U.S. policy was
                    in error as to American interest in Korean unification. During that period
                    (1958-59) I had indicated in my response to their questions that American policy
                    interests were not focused on Korean unification. Since I was the closest person
                    in the American government to Cho Pong-am and had known about his interest in
                    the reunification of Korea. They quoted other Korean sources whose stories
                    contradicted mine. According to this source, named in the article he and Cho had
                    met with Political Counselor Phillip Habib at the Ambassador's residence and
                    discussed the unification issue. I later sent them proof of the fact that Habib
                    did not arrive in Korea until two years after Cho's execution.</p>
                <p>Another thing, Briggs also told me, “You run the embassy's limited involvement in
                    the Korean domestic politicasituation. Just keep me out of trouble. I'm going to
                    keep the political section busy on Japan relations, North Korea's problems, and
                    the international problems. But I'm going to keep all these other political
                    officers out of the domestic scene, because it'll just get me in trouble with
                    all those right wingers like Walter Robertson back in the Department.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Okay. I'm going to do everything I can to ameliorate what Rhee is doing
                    here.”</p>
                <p>It came time to elect a chairman of the National Assembly. The chairman was third
                    in line to take over the presidency in that country, after the vice
                    president.</p>
                <p>Lee Bum Suk, I always felt, was on CIA's payroll, but I can't prove that. He'd
                    had this long-term connection with OSS, and he ran this bully-boy youth group
                    (Northwest Youth Corps), he had been a general, and the first Minister of
                    Defense in first Rhee government. I always had a suspicion that U.S.
                    intelligence was behind him. After he'd helped save Rhee, because he'd been the
                    hatchet man in the 1952 political crisis, he was running to be the chairman of
                    the National Assembly. The assemblymen had to vote, and it looked like he was
                    going to win it because he had Rhee's anointment and all that stuff.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>There was another man there named Yi Ki-pung. He was Western educated, he had a
                    Western-educated wife, and he was a Christian. He was a nice man, a decent man.
                    He had been in the National Assembly, and he had been part of Rhee's entourage.
                    But he was one of the moderates in Rhee's entourage. So I decided that he was a
                    better choice for the American government than this Lee Bum Suk, even though I
                    was up against maybe other aspects of the American government.</p>
                <p>The night before the election was to go off in the National Assembly (I by then
                    had moved to Seoul and was living in the smallest house in Compound I; the DCM
                    lived in that compound), I held a cocktail party, and Yi Ki-pung was the guest
                    of honor. I invited all the power brokers from the National Assembly to that
                    cocktail party that evening, and I flattered Yi Ki-pung. The ambassador dropped
                    over for a few minutes, from his residence, to the party. The next day, Yi
                    Ki-pung was elected chairman of the National Assembly.</p>
                <p>Yes, we were involved. But it was low key, not in a way that you could get in
                    trouble in Washington, and Rhee couldn't accuse us of going after him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the whole time you were there in this '52 to '58
                        period, there was a looking over one's shoulder at Washington, with Walter

                <p>I'm just looking at the time. I think we'd better quit at this point.</p>

                        together at some later date, but do you want to mention what you talked
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Oh, yes. First of all, he got off on the war and what I might know about
                    prisoners and who I knew in the way of people who might be able to tell him.
                    Then he got to talking about people he'd already talked to who'd been there at
                    the time, including a man named John Hart, who claimed he'd been chief of
                    station there, over a 500-man CIA station. When he brought it up, I remembered
                    John Hart. Hart had brought up a man named Haney, who had been his predecessor.
                    And Hart had said to this guy that Haney had been more or less pushed out of
                    there for being ineffective. I said, “Well, I can understand that.”(Hart was a
                    breath of understated competence after the colorful hyperbole prone Al Haney)
                    That brought back an incident of importance in terms of the history at that
                    period. I didn't know Haney until this event occurred, but I got to know him out
                    of it because there was so much noise made.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>The embassy got a lot of intelligence from the CIA and from the MI units and from

                <p>THOMAS: The people they had there were on six-month rotations. This chief they
                    talked about, Haney, whom I met later, was a big, affable Irishman who tended to
                    be an exaggerator, and I never took him too seriously. He always bragged about
                    how many agents he had. But I knew, from looking at reports, that he'd bought
                    into what I call the professional intelligence network that had been there for
                    years, and he was paying people who were either controlled by Rhee or controlled
                    by the other side. There was a lot of that with intelligence, and you had to
                    know it. But you still had to get along with those people, because if they had
                    something you were interested in, you didn't want to make enemies of them.</p>
                <p>It was mid-summer 1952 when we got a report in the embassy, from three different
                    intelligence units, talking about a possible coup d'�tat, top secret. These
                    reports all read about the same. You'd have thought they'd come out of the same
                    printing mill. But they came from, supposedly, three different agencies, with
                    different sources.</p>
                <p>The majority of the political people there at the time were new, but Lightner
                    wasn't new, and I'd been there and knew what the score was. But Lightner, who
                    was DCM and charg�, wasn't sure of me, because I was new, as far as he was
                    concerned.</p>
                <p>This whole situation, I think, solidified my position with Lightner. This report
                    had come in, and we'd all seen it. They used to bring all these things to my
                    office, because I was the INR guy, as the biographic officer, and had the
                    responsibility of liaison with the various intelligence units there; then it was
                    distributed throughout the embassy. I got to know all these people who would
                    come in with these reports. Generally, they weren't high-level people, they were
                    liaison people. I never commented on this stuff, because it was better not to,
                    even though you thought it was crap.</p>
                <p>Lightner read this report. We hadn't discussed this. He read it and I read it,
                    separately. I looked at this thing and I thought, “Jesus, this is baloney. This
                    is a feed.” But I didn't make any more noise about it than that, and Lightner
                    didn't either.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Major General Herron had just taken over what was known as KCOMZ, the
                    communications zone for the rear area in Korea; he, of course, was very
                    interested in this report. He was an old friend of my Dad's. I didn't know him,
                    but he'd heard about me through the Army grapevine, that I was out there and
                    knew something about Korean politics.</p>
                <p>He came in to call on Lightner, as a courtesy call to get to know the charg�; at
                    the same time, he brought up that he had read this report and was worried about
                    it. He knew that there was a man named Fred Thomas on Lightner's staff who had
                    been in Korea and knew something about Korean politics. Would he mind if Fred
                    Thomas wrote him a memo giving his views on this report?</p>
                <p>Lightner sent for me, and in front of Lightner, because we'd never discussed it,
                    the general said, “What do you think of it?”</p>
                <p>I said, “I think it's a feed.”</p>
                <p>Lightner had the same opinion, which I didn't realize.</p>
                <p>Then the general said, “Would you mind if I have young Fred here write me a
                    letter, telling me why and detailing all this, so I can study it?”</p>
                <p>Lightner said, “No. You go do that.”</p>
                <p>I wrote the letter and sent a copy to Lightner first. It went off, under my
                    signature, to General Herron, explaining why this report was full of crap.</p>
                <p>Remember, I talked, the last time we talked, about a man named Lee Bum Suk?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Lee Bum Suk was the at the center of this. In other words, he was one of
                    the coup plotters. Remember the British guy who took Lee Bum Suk's job as
                    Minister of Defense, named Shin Song-mo? They had the two of them in bed
                    together. When you start plotting a coup d'�tat in a place like Korea, you don't
                    get two enemies together plotting a coup. There's just no way. This was the
                    fundamental flaw in the report.</p>
                <p>This was all explained in detail, with a lot of stuff at the time that we knew
                    and which I can't remember at this point. Anyway, I sent it off to General
                    Herron.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Suddenly, the whole balloon burst, because the liaison guys from these three
                    intelligence units started coming into my office and giving me a hard time
                    because their bosses were madder than hell, because Herron had brought and
                    showed this letter to their bosses, with my saying their stuff was full of crap.
                    We had a little problem from then on with some of these people until they left.
                    Of course, Haney was one of these people. I met him later at a social reception,
                    and he jumped all over me about saying his report was full of it. It turned out
                    it was just that way, nothing but feed. But it did worry the devil out of the
                    military command there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, it did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: That was one story, but another story had to do with the reporting going
                    on in the press at the time in the States. It was a real education for me, being
                    a young Foreign Service officer, because I didn't really understand how badly
                    the American press at that time was biased; in the way the publisher wanted it
                    to be biased.</p>
                <p>There were two reporters there from TIME, a fellow named Jim Greenfield and a
                    fellow named Dwight Martin. They came in to call on Lightner and said they were
                    to write a full story on President Rhee for a cover issue, which was going to
                    have Rhee's picture on the cover of TIME Magazine. Lightner called me in and
                    said I could give these gentlemen access to Rhee's file. I looked at Lightner
                    and said, “There's an awful lot of very classified stuff in that file.”</p>
                <p>He said, “It doesn't matter. You can give them access.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes, sir,” and took them back to my office and gave them a desk over in
                    a corner. The two of them sat at one desk across from each other; I handed out
                    the dossiers on Rhee. They spent maybe a week there going through this stuff.
                    Then they went off on their own and came back about a week later with a draft
                    dispatch to go to TIME; they asked me to go over it for facts. I went over it
                    and made a few corrections , and it went off.</p>
                <p>When this article came out in TIME Magazine, it was 180 degrees out of phase from
                    anything they had in that draft article. If Time-Life kept copies of drafts that
                    were sent back and didn't destroy them, it might be worthwhile for a scholar to
                    go in and look at their draft, because they had access to everything we had at
                    the time, and it was a very good article as originally written.</p>
                <p>Now the last story was a humorous story. Phil Manhard and I had become good
                    friends. He was a sophisticated fellow among the people in the political section
                    at the time. But they split everybody up, and we lived all over the place. I
                    lived out next to the general in command of the port, on what had been a base
                    that the embassy had owned called Hialeah Compound. We had two houses out there
                    housing embassy people, and I lived in one of them. The way everybody lived, you
                    had a bedroom and you shared a house with other people. I shared the house with
                    the consul, Charlie Borell.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I worked for Charlie. He was one of my first bosses, in
                        Frankfurt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Is that right? Oh, he was quite a character. There's a funny story about
                    Borell I'll tell you on the side sometime. We got Charlie drunk one night, and I
                    had a tape recorder going in the house.</p>
                <p>Because of location, to go back home for lunch, because my place was pretty far
                    out of town, was inconvenient, yet a lot of people did. It was a Saturday, and
                    on Saturdays, we came informally to the embassy, usually in the morning. The
                    political crisis of 1952 had just ended, and everything was still very touchy.
                    We'd all worked long hours, and Lightner decided to have a party. He lived in
                    the residence. He and the ambassador shared the residence up on the
                    mountainside; it was a very nice place. That morning, he turned to me and said,
                    “Oh, Fred, I'm having a little fun party at my place, starting this afternoon
                    about two. Why don't you drop by?”</p>
                <p>It was to be drinks and dancing and women. He was a bachelor. We were mostly
                    bachelors at the time. So I said, “Sure.”</p>
                <p>In the meantime, though, I always had a standing invitation to have lunch with
                    Manhard on Saturdays at his place, which was not very far from the embassy. He
                    shared it with two or three other officers. One of them was a junior officer in
                    the economics section, just arrived, fresh out of Yale. He was like a brand-new
                    second lieutenant who was sort of naive but nice. Dull bright, extremely
                    academic bright, you know the type. Manhard treated him like you would a
                    shavetail. Manhard would call him, “Bache”. Anyway, we were sitting there having
                    a drink before lunch at Manhard's place that same Saturday, and I said, “I'll
                    see you this afternoon up at Lightner's place.”</p>
                <p>He said, “What's going on at Lightner's?”</p>
                <p>I told him, “A party”.</p>
                <p>He said, “That son of a bitch didn't invite me.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I'm sure he just forgot it, an oversight, Phil.”</p>
                <p>He said, “I'll fix him.”</p>
                <p>At this point, Bache walks in from off the street, coming home.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>He said, “Bache, come here! Bache, Mr. Lightner is having a party this afternoon
                    at his house. He's asked me to ask you to bring your cello and your girlfriend.
                    (Bache had a girlfriend who played the piano, and he played the classical
                    cello.) at five o'clock this evening, and play the cello for the guests at the
                    residence.”</p>
                <p>I listened to this and I didn't say a word, I just grinned. Manhard said, “You
                    watch.”</p>
                <p>So that afternoon, I was at the party. There was a good-looking lady there who
                    looked something like one of the characters out of “Terry and the Pirates,” the
                    Dragon Lady, a beautiful Chinese-looking woman, young. She seemed to take a
                    shine to me, and she sort of moved in on me fast when I got to the party. Well,
                    I learned later that this was Lightner's girlfriend!</p>
                <p>Anyway, about five that afternoon, in walked Bache with this little Korean girl;
                    she sat down at the piano. The jazz music is out on the terrace, where
                    everybody's dancing and drinking. But he's sitting there in the living room
                    (it's June), by this grand piano, sawing away at the cello for an hour, nobody
                    paying any attention. He got up and left an hour later with his girl.</p>
                <p>On Monday morning, at our informal staff meeting after the formal one, in
                    Lightner's office, Manhard walked in, looked at Lightner, and said, “Did you
                    enjoy the cello music? You won't forget to invite me next time.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, last time, we had you sort of leaving Korea, and
                        then where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: No, no, I wasn't leaving Korea. We'd just gotten the ambassador there.
                    We'd gotten up to about 1953. By 1954, we had the whole thing going on with the
                    Geneva Conference, if you remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah, yes, this was really over Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: But for some reason, and it slips my memory now, they wanted people from
                    Korea who had some experience in that situation to participate in Geneva.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's where we were talking to the Chinese, for the first
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Oh, yes, and another funny thing in terms of Manhard at the time.
                    Suddenly, because Manhard was a Marine Reserve officer and they wanted to use
                    him for these talks with the Chinese at P'anmunjom, they called him back to
                    active duty and put his uniform back on. I lived next door to the British MI6
                    for a while there, and the MI6 guy looked at me and said, “Well, this Manhard,
                    he's more than meets the eye.”</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>I said, “Well, may be, I don't know. But I like him; he's a lot of fun.”</p>
                <p>Anyway, Manhard, for that reason, got the reputation as being more than met the
                    eye. But Manhard sort of enjoyed that, anyway.</p>
                <p>Another problem was that when we had this new political chief, we had Manhard,
                    who could learn anything. He was always on the streets; he made all types of
                    contacts. But he hated to sit down in front of the typewriter. We also had
                    another fellow there, named Walter Drew. Walter was an academic sort of fellow,
                    who read the newspapers, never left the office, and turned out volumes of stuff
                    to go back to the Department, which was a regurgitation of what was in the
                    translation of the press. Which was sort of worthless; you could get that out of
                    Washington. So I made a comment to Bushner, who was then chief of political...
                    because we got to know each other socially, and we were dating two girls and
                    showing up at things together. He said, “You know, that Manhard, you like him,
                    but he doesn't write anything.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “He doesn't write anything, but he learns everything. And look at
                    Drew, he writes everything, but it's worthless. The trick is to get Manhard to
                    tell Drew what he's learning, and get Drew to write it up. And then you might,
                    you know...”</p>
                <p>So that's what happened. I can still remember being in Bushner's office when Drew
                    came in with his first dispatch going out that he'd learned from Manhard, but
                    his name only was on the bottom. With this, Bushner called both of them in, and
                    he said to Drew, “Did you learn this someplace?” (He knew where he learned
                    it.)</p>
                <p>Drew said, “I learned it from Manhard.”</p>
                <p>Bushner said, “I don't see Manhard's name on here anyplace.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, I wrote it.”</p>
                <p>Bushner said, “Well, that doesn't matter. You didn't learn it. I want you two to
                    work as a team. And if it's going to be a team, I want both names down
                    there.”</p>
                <p>From then on, that's the way it worked, and a lot more information got sent to
                    the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ambassador in '54...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>THOMAS: It was still Briggs. A fellow named Lacy didn't get there until after I
                    left. But I knew, from what I was reading when he was due to go there, that he
                    wouldn't last long, because there would been all this rumor that he'd been one
                    of the people that had changed governments in Manila and had been part of that
                    whole intelligence operation there.</p>
                <p>Rhee was very suspicious of our intelligence people. And from what we knew in the
                    embassy, at some point along there, because of it all, he'd kicked this whole
                    intelligence station out of Korea. What happened was, Rhee liked to go fishing,
                    and these intelligence people controlled a lot of small islands off the coast,
                    for smuggling and for intelligence purposes. Of course, they were considered
                    sensitive bases; any boats that got too near got fired at. It turned out that
                    Rhee was out there fishing off one of these places where the intelligence (I
                    think it was the CIA) had one of their bases, down off Pusan someplace; he got
                    too close to this island, and people fired on his fishing boat. There was hell
                    to pay, when it was found out who it was. Suddenly, Rhee said, “Get them all out
                    of here!” And so the whole station, I gather, left.</p>
                <p>Rhee was always suspicious that we were out to get rid of him. So when this
                    fellow Lacy later arrived, he didn't last long, because that's what Rhee thought
                    we were out to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about Briggs. As he settled into his job, how did
                        he relate to Korea and the Koreans, Rhee and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I'm trying to think of the man's name he got in as chief of his political
                    section, Arch Calhoun. There was a man he liked, who was very brilliant. He
                    could dictate a dispatch or cable and not need to edit it. I didn't have that
                    talent.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the ambassador told him, “Stay out of Korean domestic politics. We'll
                    only get ourselves in trouble with the Department. Let Fred handle it because
                    he's been here for a long time. And make sure that anybody who writes anything
                    on domestic politics is cleared by Fred. We're just not going to mess with
                    domestic politics, because there's not too much we can do. We don't particularly
                    like Rhee, but we've got Walter Robertson to deal with back home.”</p>
                <p>He had them busying themselves with the P'anmunjom talks, what was going on
                    there, what was going on with reference to Korean-Japanese relations, which were
                    terrible and were going to remain terrible, and still to this day, aren't the
                    best. This was due to the history of the relationship between the people of
                    Korea and Japan and what happened there during the occupation. But that's what
                    they busied themselves with. They didn't get involved. I was the one who was
                    involved, what little involvement there was. You could just try to ameliorate
                    the situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>It was like that story I told you about Yi Ki-pung and how I gave a cocktail
                    party for him and he became the speaker of the National Assembly. He was an
                    attempt to ameliorate the fascist tendencies of the Rhee regime, rather than let
                    Lee Bum Suk, who was a strong-arm type, get that job. But you couldn't really do
                    much more than that.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, Briggs was probably the most capable and courageous ambassador I
                    served under in my career; he also was such a good writer that he could sell the
                    most outrageous ideas as being logical.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Briggs cotton to Korea and the Koreans at all, or was
                        he more a European hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: He was more a European hand. Most of the ambassadors we sent there were
                    European hands. (In retrospect, this will always be the case. The politically
                    appointed ambassadors with real clout with the White House serve in the European
                    capitals. They look after the career types who work for them and there are few
                    other places they can serve as important as Asia.) Briggs liked to have his true
                    staff meeting at four or five in the afternoon, over martinis, by the fireplace
                    at home, with a few people that he liked. That was the way the embassy ran. He
                    wanted to cut the hell out of that embassy, but they wouldn't let him. So he
                    just let most of the staff float. He always harked back to his experience in
                    Czechoslovakia, where they kicked everybody out. They forced that embassy down
                    to 15 people; he said it was the most efficient embassy he ever had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, okay, we're up in the mid-''50s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: In 1954, Rhee was due to make a presidential visit to this country. My
                    two-year tour was just about up; I was put on a commercial flight going back
                    with Rhee's advanced staff. I got to know them and talked to some of his Western
                    advisors that I didn't know before. It had already been set for me to go into
                    Korean-language school. I left there sometime in July; it's hazy now. Anyway,
                    Rhee was to come about a week later. I went off to Korean-language school; I
                    wasn't there from '54 through '56. That's when Lacy came in and took over from
                    Briggs. Then Lacy got bumped out of there. I think, at the time I got back
                    there, he was not there, but I don't think the new ambassador had arrived yet,
                    as I remember it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about Korean-language school. Where'd you
                        take it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Many people had been sent to Yale. FSI didn't really have a full course
                    in those days. They were fiddling around, talking about it. So they decided,
                    because of my military background, to send me to Monterey.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah, yes, ALS. I'm an alumnus of it. I took a year's
                        Russian there, back in '51.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Is that right? This was '54, and I can still remember, it was sort of
                    fun. There was one other Foreign Service officer on the post, a guy taking
                    Cantonese, named Ainsworth. I didn't get to know him because our overlap was
                    just a month or so and then he was gone. I was in the Korean department.</p>
                <p>The Koreans liked me. I knew how to get along with Koreans. I already knew the
                    drill and had gotten along very well. The Korean teachers and everybody found me
                    very interesting, and I got to know them. The colonel in command of the post put
                    out a post order. It caused me to kid these guys, some of my West Point
                    classmates there who were lieutenants and captains. There was one who was a
                    lieutenant colonel; he had been pushed out before he graduated, for getting
                    married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For getting married at West Point. You couldn't do that in
                        those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: In his first class year, he got kicked out of the Academy. So he enlisted
                    in the Army, went through OCS, was commissioned, and was a second lieutenant
                    with a Quartermaster unit in Japan when the Korean War broke out. He went AWOL
                    and joined a regimental combat team in Korea, as an officer, but just joined
                    them on his own, and took command of a platoon, ending up being highly decorated
                    and battlefield promoted up to the rank of lieutenant colonel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: So here he was, the highest-ranking member of his West Point class. It
                    was a year before my class, I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your class was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Mine was '48 or '49. It was a split class. I think his was maybe '47.
                    Anyway, he was at the language school along with some of the guys that were in
                    my class. I kidded them because they put out a post order giving me the personal
                    rank of full bull.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was full colonel.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>THOMAS: Yes, full colonel, on the post, for social purposes. They had to do this,
                    because the post commander held special “attach� parties” to teach the attach�s
                    how to get along at diplomatic functions. As a means of limiting the size of
                    these parties, only full colonels were invited unless an officer of lesser rank
                    already had an assignment as an attach� to a diplomatic mission abroad. They
                    gave me this rank since most attach�s were full colonels; they wanted me to go
                    to these parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I was the one State Department person there.</p>
                <p>I spent a full year there and got the rudiments because Korean is a very
                    difficult language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's very situational, and it depends on the social rank
                        and male-female. I spent two weeks studying the language while I was in
                        Korea, and once I got a feel for what the problem was, I said, “Screw
                        this.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Oh, it's terrible. They had people trying to commit suicide there, from
                    the pressure. Guys who were honor graduates of the War College were flunking out
                    of language school, because they weren't good at language. The smartest guy in
                    my class, in Korean, was some hillbilly from West Virginia who hadn't finished
                    high school, but he was a natural linguist. He's an interesting story, a
                    Pygmalion story. The Korean teachers, many with advanced college degrees from
                    our best universities, said that when he spoke English they tended to look down
                    on him as being an uneducated hick, but when he spoke Korean, he became an
                    educated Korean because of his spoken command of that language. It led later,
                    after his assignment to Korea, to his marriage to an upper class Korean young
                    woman from a wealthy family.</p>
                <p>I guess there must have been 400 people studying Korean in my class, mostly ASA,
                    NSA, and the intelligence people for the...</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Teaching language goes through all types of permutations and combinations. At
                    that point, they were teaching it by treating you like a child. They wouldn't
                    tell you anything. You'd learn it like a child learns English. They'd pick up a
                    pencil, and they'd say, “This is a pencil.” They'd pick up a pen and say, “This
                    is a pen,” in the language. And you were to figure out, from hearing this over
                    and over and over, what was the pen and what was the pencil and what “this is”,
                    just from hearing it and doping it out. Well, that's all right, maybe, for kids,
                    but adults just get very frustrated with that approach. It was very frustrating
                    for most of us. And they had all the rooms bugged, so that if a teacher started
                    doing anything different, it was known down in the office and they'd get hell
                    for it. So they had to stick to this routine drill. Then they had a damned
                    military vocabulary you would have to learn; it was crazy because you barely
                    knew how to speak the language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Take me to your 166th millimeter regiment, that type
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: You couldn't say toilet yet, and here you were... The craziest damn
                    method... A year of this was very frustrating.</p>
                <p>I rented a small cottage in Carmel, which was very nice. I became the darling of
                    what I call the divorcee set. As a single man, I was invited to a lot of
                    parties. It was an interesting year. I got to know some of the arty types around
                    Carmel, and went to the club. Every year the club had a function where each
                    language department was to put up a booth to make money for charity. A major in
                    the Asian Department there was a part-time student, part-time administrator, an
                    official interpreter, and an excellent linguist. He also ran the club. The next
                    morning after this function was over, I said to him, “I didn't see a Korean
                    booth here last night”.</p>
                <p>He said, “Oh, that's a funny story. It tells the difference between the Koreans,
                    the Chinese, and the Japanese. Yesterday morning, the Chinese arrived early in
                    the morning and started hammering and sawing and putting everything together to
                    build their booth to sell Chinese food. And by six in the evening, when the
                    benefit opened, they were finished. About three in the afternoon, the Japanese
                    arrived; everything precut, bang, bang, bang, it's up, and they're done. About
                    six in the evening, the Korean Department head came in and said, 'Where's our
                    booth?' He expected somebody to build it for them.”</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Anyway, it was an interesting year to be there, with so much going on in Asia at
                    the time, with our first getting involved with Southeast Asia. I felt that there
                    were better ways to learn a language. The teachers were good, but they should
                    have been left alone to teach language rather than the time spent teaching
                    military vocabulary. Korean is such a complex language, but the vocabulary will
                    come if you've got command of the structure and command of the fundamental verbs
                    of the language. That became obvious later, especially when I was learning
                    Chinese. I realized that if you can really handle Chinese fluently, the needed
                    vocabulary is easy to add. The problem is getting the structure down and
                    handling it fluently with ease. Korean is a much harder language to learn to
                    speak than Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After a year at the language school, where did you
                        go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I went back to the Department, and there were some arguments over whether
                    I was going to go back to the political or economic section, because some people
                    said, It might be better if he did some economic work for broadening, or some
                    consular work.” I didn't want to do consular work. Because I was young, there
                    also was some worry among some of the senior guys that my experience in Korea,
                    combined with my language training might upstage them; I had already made some
                    enemies for these reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure you had.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Thank God I had an ambassador who appreciated me, but some of the people
                    in between didn't. By the time it was straightened out and the arguments
                    settled, nearly a year had passed. I was glad to have that time to see my family
                    because my parents were getting older. I left in the late summer of '56.</p>

                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: They were then in the middle of an aid program, big aid programs, and a
                    lot of money being wasted. There were a lot of questions in people's minds about
                    the corruption, tremendous corruption, in Korea. Sort of like you have in China
                    today. An awful lot of stealing. Because Rhee was always balancing forces
                    underneath him, it didn't matter whether you were corrupt. The issue was, if
                    your group got too powerful, he'd put another group in. When you're playing that
                    balancing act, you've got to put up with a lot of bad apples. And he had lots of
                    them.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>There's one other story that I think should be told because it has to do with
                    that corruption problem. Just after Briggs arrived, this was the late summer of
                    '52, Strong was the economic chief, the fellow who used to get drunk and tell
                    everything to his mistress; shortly thereafter a man named Sydney Mellen, who
                    was a very nice man, arrived to head the economic section. His wife was Italian,
                    and he was a European diplomat, very sophisticated, very charming, but he really
                    wasn't used to dealing with Asian subterfuge (although I felt, after Italy, he
                    should have had some knack).</p>
                <p>Anyway, he was at a staff meeting, where he told the brand new ambassador that
                    the Koreans had managed a recent currency exchange, that is currency reform,
                    beautifully, and it was a massive success.</p>
                <p>What it amounted to was that on one day they suddenly announced that you had 24
                    hours to turn in all your currency and get new currency. You'd get one-for-one
                    up to a certain level, then you'd get...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The currency being the wan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: You'd get less as the amounts went up, so it was a way of contracting the
                    money out there, which would indicate that the rich were going to get hit this
                    way, especially the black marketeers.</p>
                <p>So this was “beautifully run.” Sydney announced the date the decision was made,
                    the date of the decision, which I didn't know. I hadn't been following economics
                    that much; I was a political officer. The decision had been made three months
                    before, and he gave the exact date that he'd been told by Korean officials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about 195...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Two. Had been made several months before. And he gave the exact date that
                    he'd been told by the finance ministry, then. Not at the time, because this was
                    all done, supposedly, on the q.t. by the Koreans. The exact date of this
                    decision, that is the date it was made.</p>
                <p>Mr. Shin, who worked with me, was the top translator/interpreter, the
                    highest-paid Korean on the political section's payroll. I asked Mr. Shin, “Could
                    you locate and a day-to-day listing of the price, on the black market, of gold,
                    diamonds, and dollars for the past four months? If you could do that and get it
                    translated into English for us, that would be great.”</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Because I had my suspicions, and I wanted date-by-date, from black marketeers.
                    Mr. Shin got it all. The inflation rate on the wan to dollar on the wan to gold
                    was going like this, see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're demonstrating a very slow... just basically almost
                        flat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Flat, but going up slightly, the change in rate of exchange on these
                    items. When you hit the day that this decision was made, that curve goes
                    straight up. I said, “Mr. Shin, can you go to the graphics people in USIS and
                    get this all put on charts for us?”</p>
                <p>He did, in English. At the next staff meeting, a week later, I came in and I said
                    to Sydney, “Sydney, I've got something I want to show you and the ambassador
                    because I think you made a comment that the Koreans told you how honestly this
                    currency exchange was carried out, and what a great job they did. Let me show
                    you something.” When we got to the conference room, I showed this chart to
                    everybody. It told the whole story. These newcomers needed to understand how
                    Korea worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It endeared you, obviously, to Sydney.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Actually, we got along very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned something, and I think it's a part of the
                        thing that's very seldom mentioned. It's always a topic of interest. And
                        let's talk about, in the ''50s, at your embassy, sex at the embassy. Because
                        having served in Saigon, during the ''60s, I see what happened there. What
                        was the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: All right. Sex at the embassy. First of all, there was a long period, and
                    it was the period when I first arrived when there were no American women in our
                    embassy. So you had “Rhee's offering”, a group called the Nak Nong Club, that
                    was made up of grass widows from the Korean War, younger women whose
                    husbands...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Koreans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Koreans, who were more or less educated, who knew some English. And they
                    were sicced on the embassy as basically an intelligence operation. So you had a
                    lot of these Korean women running around, and they were the ones, for instance,
                    at Lightner's party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nak Nong means what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>THOMAS: Nak Nong, I think it was the name of a river, the Nak Nong River. But I
                    don't know where they got the name. Manhard and I used to kid about these Mata
                    Hari's from the Nak Nong Club. Well, that was the situation. We had all male
                    clerks in the registry and in the code room. You could never find anything.</p>
                <p>Oh, a story that illustrates the Wild West atmosphere that prevailed in an
                    embassy without women; there was a fellow named Doyle Gentry, who was a lot of
                    fun, a file clerk in the code room. Doyle was a big, hulky man. We all carried
                    pistols in those days. He got drunk one night, when he was living in this
                    barracks-like place, which was of Japanese construction. The rats could be heard
                    running across in the overhead between the roof and the ceiling. He was in his
                    bed, drunker than the devil, trying to shoot the rats. He couldn't see them, so
                    he'd shoot at the noise...This held until the women arrived.</p>
                <p>At first, there were no wives, only female secretaries and clerks. There was one
                    woman officer, who I started to date. Margaret Booth, Peg ended up marrying
                    Manhard. She's a very nice woman. Peg was personnel officer. Then we had new
                    secretaries in the ambassador's office and in the consulate. There must have
                    been a dozen women who came in, which brightened the place up.</p>
                <p>At the same time, there always were some nurses with the U.N. around. And some of
                    the more aggressive fellows that were... I was 25 and I was interested in women,
                    but I wasn't ever the type that would go out and introduce myself on my own, or
                    go try to pick up some girl someplace that I didn't know. That just wasn't my
                    style. I guess I'd been brought up sort of proper, and I just didn't do it that
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the Korean mistress permeated the system, did you
                        think, or not at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: We had several people, like Strong, who had a mistress. Most of them, I
                    think, were just one-night stands, that type thing, with most people there. But
                    you've got to remember, the two top officers were bachelors—Lightner and Muccio;
                    they had their Korean girlfriends.</p>
                <p>There was another woman officer who arrived there on TDY from Tokyo. She was a
                    reserve officer from the Department, who was very good looking. I dated her, but
                    she later married Muccio. She was a sophisticated looking woman.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>It was sort of wild and wooly after the first American women arrived. I can still
                    remember some of the parties were a bit on the... I think there was a lot of...
                    You know, women and men, there's a lot of interest in sex, and things went on. I
                    dated Margaret, but my relationship with her was rather proper. She was a nice
                    person, and I didn't want to get married. I was the type of guy that believed if
                    you got to fiddling with a woman, you had to... I was old fashioned in the
                    old-fashioned way. Manhard started to date her; they fell in love and were
                    married in Seoul.</p>
                <p>I remember some of the girls were, well, rather proper. There was a Jewish girl
                    there who worked as the ambassador's secretary, very bright, and she had a
                    quick, sharp wit, but she could also be nasty at times. She lived in the house
                    behind me, where Peg lived. I was over there all the time, visiting with Peg.
                    One morning I was coming out of my place; I was generally cheerful, and in such
                    a tone offered her a ride, in my jeep station wagon. She was waiting for an
                    embassy car to pick her up, the car hadn't come yet. And so I said, “Do you want
                    to ride with me?”</p>
                <p>She said, “What are you so cheerful about?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, it's a nice day.”</p>
                <p>She said, “You wouldn't be so goddamned cheerful if you had to sleep alone every
                    night.” She was a very rigid girl.</p>
                <p>We lived back to back, these two houses. A retired lieutenant general from the
                    British Army lived on one side of me; he headed UNKRA. He was a very nice guy.
                    He liked us and we liked him. And then there was a brigadier general in the
                    American Army who lived cater-cornered from us, who was the Pusan Port
                    commander. He disliked State Department people with a passion; he didn't like
                    having us there in the first place.</p>
                <p>The interesting thing was that the entire compound on which we lived was embassy
                    property. It had been in the embassy's hands as a base for storing stuff coming
                    in at the port of Pusan to be shipped to Seoul, Hialeah Compound. With the war
                    on, we'd turned it over to the military to use, but we'd kept control, in the
                    sense that we still had title to it. On that base, we allowed the U.N. UNKRA to
                    build a lot of brand-new housing for its employees who were to be part of their
                    aid mission. Part of the deal was that, for letting them do this, they would let
                    us have two of the houses to live in. We were given houses near the UNKRA-Club
                    (mess hall), the prestige houses right next to the general. I lived in one of
                    these houses.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>General Lestayo, who was the port commander, disliked us all, but his colonel,
                    his chief of staff, was friendly with all the girls in the embassy. He would
                    report back to the girls in the embassy what was going on in Lestayo's office.
                    Lestayo was always cussing the embassy people, that they were terrible people,
                    etc. etc. All these young people living like senior officers, etc., etc. He was
                    a character. He was a West Pointer but he'd only made brigadier general; I think
                    he was frustrated and unhappy with his career.</p>
                <p>In the summertime, he would have movies in his garden, and the volume was so loud
                    that you couldn't hear yourself think in the neighborhood. He'd invite nobody to
                    come to watch these movies. He'd just be there alone. None of us liked Lestayo.
                    One summer evening, a whole group of us were drinking at Peg's house. She had a
                    little German-made cap pistol. When fired, wadding would come out of the barrel.
                    It was powerful enough that the wadding could break a champagne glass. I was
                    brought up around the military; I shot pistols and rifles, and I'd hunted. And
                    so here I was, with this pistol that belonged to Peg; We'd had enough to drink,
                    and I was shooting out champagne glasses on the table with this cap pistol.
                    These glasses were cheap to buy at the commissary or the PX; they were Japanese.
                    Anyway, everybody was laughing and having a good time; suddenly a siren went off
                    for an air raid, and all the lights were turned off everywhere. We were waiting
                    around; we went out on the porch of her house. I was firing this pistol in the
                    air, and she said to me, “General Lestayo probably will be raising hell about
                    this, Fred.”</p>
                <p>I said, “If that son of a bitch comes around here, I'll shoot his ass.” It was
                    just a cap pistol.</p>
                <p>It turned out he was around the corner, listening to all this. He'd come over
                    there, and he'd heard all this.</p>
                <p>He went to the general in charge of the UNKRA (Sir Arthur Rucker, Lt Gen., Ret'd,
                    B.A.). He badgered him because UNKRA owned the houses we lived in; that is,
                    UNKRA was, in his view, our landlord and they should do something about these
                    embassy people who were firing firearms in the compound. It was very
                    dangerous.</p>
                <p>Because I lived next door to the general who headed UNKRA, he asked me what all
                    that noise was about. I told him exactly what had happened, that it was a cap
                    pistol. He laughed, and said, “I just got a letter from General Lestayo
                    complaining, wanting me to give you folks hell about all this. I'm going to go
                    back to him and say that's not our business because, although we do own the
                    house temporarily, you own it all as the embassy; therefore, he should deal with
                    you folks.”</p>
                <p>Then we got feedback from the colonel in his office that Lestayo was madder than
                    hell at this British general for not doing anything and forcing him to write a
                    letter to the embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>The letter came to the embassy, complaining. Cassidy, the administrative officer,
                    brought it up to me and said, “Would you answer this in the name of the embassy,
                    for my signature. You know what happened.”</p>
                <p>So I wrote one of those very serious letters saying, “This is serious. We have
                    investigated, and we feel that, if what you had to say here were true, it would
                    be a very serious situation. However, from our investigation, it's very hard for
                    us to believe that you, a professional military man, cannot tell the difference
                    between a real firearm and a cap pistol.”</p>
                <p>The feedback from the colonel indicated that the General was livid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's go back. You came out of the Army Language
                        School and you had a year in Washington. What were you doing in

                <p>THOMAS: I was assigned to a couple of courses at FSI and writing some reports

                    leave I had. Then there was serious discussion concerning over where in the

                    the end, I went back to the political section.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, was the embassy back in Seoul?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Yes. When I went back to Seoul the first time, I was living over in what
                    was called Compound I, in one of the smaller houses over there. When I came back
                    the next time, I shared a house with two other bachelors, on embassy row in
                    Compound II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That had been an old Japanese...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Banking...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Banking... I lived in Compound II for three years.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>THOMAS: Most of the people did. When I first went up there, I think everybody
                    lived in a big house that was sort of treated like a hotel, which had a big
                    garden around it. You had a room in it until they could find a place for you.
                    They had a club there on the premises, an embassy club, and a commissary, with a
                    bar. Even then, the majority of the people in the embassy were single people. As
                    a matter of fact, there are friends in the Foreign Service who say that I taught
                    them how to be a political officer in the '52 to '54 period. Manhard knew how to
                    do things; you didn't have to teach Manhard anything. But you had a lot of
                    people coming in, for whom this was their first or second post; it was their
                    first post in a place like Asia. Roy Haverkamp always says to me, “Well, you
                    taught me how to be a political officer.” Do you know Roy?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I don't. Where is he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: He's retired here now, but he served in Japan and in Korea. I think he
                    also served in Sweden. His last position before he retired was with Defense in
                    one of these liaison posts with, I think, the Navy. I think for a while he was
                    charg� or maybe number-two man in the Bahamas or one of those places in the
                    Caribbean.</p>
                <p>And then there was a fellow named George Barbis who was there at the time, and I
                    sort of helped him learn something about Korea. Then there was O'Mahoney, who
                    was an economic officer. They were all bachelors there with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation in '56?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>THOMAS: Did I tell you the story about the military getting involved with
                    political reporting, and Briggs wanting that straightened out? Within a few
                    weeks of the end of the war, that is summer 1953, Eighth Army G-2 suddenly began
                    to send long political analyses concerning the local scene to Washington. The
                    views expressed were off the wall. Briggs was fit to be tied and so was the
                    Department. He liked the CG Max Taylor but he didn't have too much respect for
                    the military in general. He sent for me and said “Fred you come from a military
                    family; do you think you could do anything to stop this foolishness?” I asked
                    him to loan me his long black limo. He agreed; flags flying I arrived at the
                    “Bunker” at 8th Army Hq. Breezed in, left my calling card and asked for an
                    appointment to see the G-2, a full colonel. By the time I returned to my office
                    in the Embassy the colonel had called and set an appointment for the next
                    morning. The meeting was a real pony show. I was ushered into a large conference
                    room full of mostly Lt. Colonels. The G-2 was a very affable man. In response to
                    my question concerning how they came to the conclusions concerning the local
                    political situation which they were forwarding to Washington, the answer was
                    mind boggling! As the Colonel explained, each intelligence report no matter from
                    which service had a “Grade for example varying from A-1 to F-6”. A-1 meant the
                    source was an A source or the finest, and the information being a 1 was solid,
                    no question about it accuracy. These various agencies gave their own reports
                    these grades before they distributed them. Many of these Lt. Colonels were
                    trained in higher math. They used a computer to average these grades on all such
                    reports and come up with an analysis which was therefore “objective”. I couldn't
                    believe what I was hearing. I convinced the colonel that he should allow some of
                    his officers responsible for this reporting to join me on a regular basis at my
                    home for dinner when I was entertaining Korean politicians. Within a short
                    period, they were bringing their analyses to me for review before sending them
                    to Washington. From then on we didn't have the same problem with the military. (
                    In retrospect, on reading recent comments in the press about the failures of the
                    intelligence community over the past twenty years and remembering the series of
                    debriefings done by CIA and INR over my own career, it is my conclusion that the
                    “academic” system done here in Washington of arriving at political assessments
                    was and is doomed to failure. One must be there, have command of the language,
                    diplomatic access to the government in question including all aspects of the
                    local political spectrum and have the courage to tell it as it is, not as is
                    wanted, either by powerful special interests here, or the Department which is
                    reflecting the desires of the Establishment. My experiences in both Korea and
                    Pakistan clearly indicate the foundation for my opinion.)</p>
                <p>But the Rhee government was constantly shuffling people around, to keep Rhee in
                    power. He was a great revolutionary, but a hell of a poor administrator of a
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As so often happens.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>THOMAS: This resulted in our aid being stolen blind. Really, in big money.
                    Corruption was rampant. Three hundred, four hundred million dollars, back in
                    those days, was pretty big money. That's what we were putting up a year. I
                    remember the figure $360 million, or something like that, a year, in terms of
                    aid.</p>
                <p>By then, a new ambassador had arrived, by the name of Dowling. I liked Dowling,
                    but in the end, I didn't get along very well with Mrs. Dowling. I was brought up
                    around the military, and I had a code of ethics, from my father, a cavalry
                    officer, that went, “The horses, the men, and then yourself.” You know how
                    administrative officers are, money comes in, and it's supposed to be used, let's
                    say, to upgrade the heating systems in the small houses for the clerks. Get rid
                    of space heaters, which were very dangerous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could be asphyxiated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Asphyxiated, or they could start a fire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Carbon monoxide and the whole thing. Those were
                        dangerous.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: A lot of people were living with space heaters in these little houses in
                    Compound II. As I remember it, there were several issues. First of all, I ended
                    up being elected president of the embassy club, by all the single people. Now
                    you had just enough married people there that they wanted special privileges for
                    themselves; I was the bulwark against being that black and white. But, at that
                    point, in terms of problems, there was money that came in to put steam heat or
                    boilers in, for these smaller houses that all the secretaries lived in, in one
                    section of that compound, Compound II. They were little, teeny houses. It was
                    spent instead to put in a greenhouse or something like that, or a solarium, for
                    Madam Ambassador. I got wind of this, and I started raising hell, “This is
                    wrong.” Well, she got wind of my raising hell about it all because I went to the
                    administrative officer and said, “This is wrong. This should not be.” The word
                    got back; it didn't make me too popular with her. The ambassador had not been
                    involved in all this. She'd been the one who pressured or pushed for this; the
                    administrative officer, instead of telling her this money was for something
                    else, just did it. It also didn't make me very popular with the administrative
                    officer.</p>
                <p>But you had that type situation; you had a lot of corruption. You had the U.N.
                    using our club, and the Turks, including the Turkish ambassador, who were
                    selling stuff out of the club to beat hell. I went to our ambassador, Dowling,
                    about it, and Dowling said, “Well, cut him off.” So I cut him off. He went to
                    the ambassador about not being allowed to shop at our club, and the ambassador
                    said, “The president of the club cut you off for reasons, I understand.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Yes.”</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>He said, “I can't change that. He's in charge of the club. I can't do anything
                    about that.”</p>
                <p>And that ended it.</p>
                <p>But you had a lot of that going on.</p>
                <p>I remember one of the first things that happened. It was not the same as under
                    Briggs any longer, because I didn't have that type protection. But I had a lot
                    more knowledge and I had the language. I liked to travel, anyway. In those days,
                    traveling around Korea took weeks. And I had my own four-wheel-drive station
                    wagon Jeep.</p>
                <p>We had a new economic officer and a new security officer, who shared the house
                    with me. We were all bachelors.An economic officer who shared the house with me
                    said, “Look, I'd like to go on a trip around this country. Will you take me on
                    one of your trips? I want to do some economic stuff.”</p>
                <p>He accompanied me on the next trip. After the trip, we wrote a dispatch. I said
                    “Look, don't try to put this in a cable. You'll never get it out of the embassy.
                    Just write a dispatch on everything we've learned. They won't bother to read it,
                    you know, all the details. It'll get sent. Then we'll write a letter to somebody
                    in the Department, telling them to get hold of that dispatch.”</p>
                <p>This dispatch told about how all this money, our AID money, was being siphoned
                    off by Rhee's party, the Liberal Party. It involved fertilizer sales. The
                    fertilizer was to be sold at a price based on the official rate of exchange.
                    This pricing was rationalized on the basis that it would help the farmer. The
                    official rate of exchange was less than half of the black market rate. For
                    example, say a bag of fertilizer at the official rate of exchange was to sell
                    for 200 won; it actually was sold to the farmer for lets say 440 won. USAID was
                    reimbursed the 200 and the remaining 240 was siphoned off to the Liberal Party.
                    This corruption involved tremendous amounts of money, in the hundreds of
                    millions of dollars.</p>
                <p>It turned out that the AID director was back in Washington at the time this thing
                    hit the fan, and Congress got a copy of it. USAID Washington sent cables to the
                    embassy, asking the embassy to disavow this dispatch, to say it wasn't true. Of
                    course, the ambassador took one look at it, as did Ed Cronk, the economic chief,
                    who was at a recent cocktail party, said, “Oh, we didn't dare do that. We knew
                    damn well it was the truth. But it would have never gotten out of there if it
                    hadn't gotten out of there that way.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would that have been? I'm trying to get down how
                        things worked. You've got massive corruption.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>THOMAS: You have these people who always want things to look like they're going
                    well. I was in Vietnam when the whole thing fell apart; that's another story
                    that we'll get into later. But I've come to the conclusion that, when you get up
                    there in the stratosphere as a senior in this place, it's a mutual back
                    scratching thing. People sit on each other's boards; they don't want to create
                    problems for each other. You don't want to tell Washington too much that makes
                    anybody else look bad. ...what went on and what came out of the dispatches from
                    our embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While we're on the corruption thing, you were there, this
                        second tour, from '56 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Fifty-eight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To '58.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Oh, there's a story out of that whole thing I've got to tell, because it
                    becomes important by the time '58 comes around. It happened before then, and
                    this is very important as the lead-up.</p>
                <p>In the '53-'54 period, my father (Who by then was retired as a colonel in
                    Pennsylvania, his health having come back to a degree) became very involved in
                    the Kiwanis Club of Pennsylvania. After being president of his local town
                    Kiwanis, he was elected as a lieutenant governor of the state district. Out of
                    being involved with the Kiwanis, he became involved in local politics in
                    Pennsylvania. He was a good Republican, who met various Republicans, including a
                    new, reform mayor (because a lot of Democratic politics in Pennsylvania was very
                    corrupt) in Philadelphia named Dilworth. He wasn't mayor at that time, but
                    later, became mayor.</p>
                <p>My father also developed an interest in Korea, because I was there. I had access
                    to the APO system where you could mail big packages for practically nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might just mention, APO means Army Post Office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: He could mail all this stuff; he started a collection of used clothing
                    for Korean children and adults throughout the Kiwanis Clubs in one district of
                    Pennsylvania. These packages started to arrive in mass. There was a little
                    warehouse behind my house on Compound I that was maybe as big as three of these
                    rooms stretched out put together, stacked from floor to ceiling with these
                    packages. I had a hell of time keeping up with this stuff. I also knew that if I
                    wasn't careful, it would be stolen and sold, and it wouldn't get to poor people.
                    I was trying my best to get it out. I remember making trips out to the
                    provinces, and going to schools and giving children's clothing away to kids,
                    etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>In 1952, during my first period there, I had lived in Pusan with a guy who was
                    the labor attach�. He quit after only a few months, because he didn't like it.
                    But during his few months there, he started inviting labor leaders to our place.
                    We had to entertain together because we lived in the same house. One labor
                    leader came, whose name was Kim Tu-han, and it turned out Kim Tu-han was not
                    only a labor leader, but he was king of the thieves' market. He'd been king of
                    the thieves' market under the Japanese. He and his bodyguard came and got drunk;
                    I remember fishing their .38 snubnoses out of the toilet because they fell out
                    of their holsters when they were throwing up in the toilet. Anyway, I got to
                    know him out of this.</p>
                <p>By '54, I had all this clothing coming in, and I was giving it out. Part of this
                    stuff that came in was fur coats. To whom do you give a fur coat? I went to Kim
                    Tu-han, who was then in the National Assembly, elected by the prostitutes of
                    Korea. I asked him, “Would you hold an auction for these fur coats down in the
                    prostitution section, and bring me the money?” He did and he brought me the
                    money.</p>
                <p>Then I wrote a letter to all the missionaries, telling them how I did this and
                    where the money came from. Were they willing to take their share? Because a lot
                    of these women were constantly giving me hell. I remember, later, Mrs. Dowling
                    was trying to run things, in terms of help to the needy, and the missionaries
                    were always against having gambling or drinking, all these problems. Anyway,
                    they took the money; nobody turned me down.</p>
                <p>I tell this because, later, in '58, my father's involvement in politics in
                    Pennsylvania all comes into an important story. But we'll drop it for that.
                    Anyway, that was the flashback.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were talking about '56 to '58, when you were there on
                        this other tour.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: You asked me what the real political problems were. The real political
                    problems then were really Rhee and trying to make that government effective, in
                    terms of all this aid money we were dumping in there. It wasn't going any place
                    because of Rhee. Yet, here in the Department, you had Walter Robertson and that
                    whole bunch who looked on Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek as second Jesus Christs.
                    Therefore, what could you do? You were really hamstrung. You had to pretend all
                    was going well, to keep the money coming. People were pretending that, and
                    that's why they didn't like that dispatch that got back there. And that's why it
                    wouldn't have gone if it hadn't been in dispatch form. But it got out, due to
                    the way it was handled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might, just for the record, mention there were
                        telegrams, which were more or less succinct and usually got the okay of the
                        ambassador and the deputy chief. But the dispatch was where you could sit
                        down and where you could write. It was like an essay, which went by pouch.
                        It was air-pouched, but it took a little while. These were where you did
                        your think pieces in those days. Now, everything is by telegram. Often, very
                        busy people wouldn't read a dispatch.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>THOMAS: No, and you had to have an abstract in the front of it. When it reached
                    Washington, maybe some junior clerk might read it. But you did this as a means
                    of getting around the system of approvals, which some of the junior officers
                    learned; I learned early in the game, out of that biographic story I told
                    you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You used it, and then you wrote a private letter saying,
                        “Read this.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: That's, in essence, what was done. I don't know, maybe they read
                    dispatches from then on, emanating from many of those junior officers there. We
                    got very frustrated, of course. You couldn't get things out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was because, at the top, they wanted to look
                        good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Wristonization had occurred at this time, and we had a lot of new
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what Wristonization means.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Well, a fellow named Henry Wriston, I think...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: President of Brown University.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: He was brought in to look over the State Department and decide what was
                    wrong. At this point, he decided that you had to make the State Department and
                    the Foreign Service all one service. We had to get rid of this idea that you had
                    professional foreign-affairs officers in State who never went abroad, but sat in
                    the Department. And you had to upgrade the positions, in terms of importance of
                    what was then the staff corps because they had to have more status and titles,
                    like a diplomat. There was a whole change of attitude because of
                    Wristonization.</p>
                <p>Many new FSO's were brought in from the Department at relatively senior ranks. A
                    man would be, say, a GS-14 or -15 in the Department. He'd come in at what was
                    then a Class 3 officer, Class 2 officer, something on that order. They'd come
                    out for a first tour at a foreign post, and they didn't really know anything
                    about being a diplomat. They understood how to write cables from the Department,
                    and how to go through the bureaucracy back here, but not how an embassy worked
                    or how you got things done out there or how you went about entertaining
                    people.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>A new political chief whose name was William Jones was one of them. He'd been on
                    the Korea Desk back here, and he ended up being chief of the political section.
                    Bill Jones and his wife, Betty, were very nice people, but they really didn't
                    understand that Korea, or foreign posts, are not like Washington. His whole
                    approach was that if he could just be the best buddy with the Desk chief for the
                    United States in the Korean Foreign Ministry, he had it made. His buddy Kim
                    Tong-cho would tell him anything he needed to know, and that was all that was
                    necessary. Kim Tong-cho was just another small, petty bureaucrat, who wasn't
                    part of the power structure of Korea and really didn't know what was going on in
                    Korea. And if you understood the Korean structure, and understood anything about
                    Korea, you didn't bother your time with bureaucrats in the foreign ministry. But
                    you couldn't tell Jones this. And so he went his own way, doing this. Of course,
                    it kept him on top of all the foreign-affairs matters that the foreign ministry
                    wanted us to believe. I kept telling Bill and the ambassador (and the ambassador
                    took me more seriously than Bill did) that the foreign affairs of Korea are not
                    run by the foreign ministry or by their ambassadors. They are run by the DCMs in
                    all their embassies abroad; the orders come directly from Kyungmudae (the Korean
                    White House).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Kyungmudae was the White House. In other words, the president
                    sends...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Blue House.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: The Korean name for it was the Kyungmudae. This Blue House came
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That came later, but at that time, it was still considered
                        the White House.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: The Kyungmudae was just the name of the area in the Seoul where the
                    President's residence is located.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the ambassador started to realize that maybe what I was saying was true,
                    but you couldn't tell Bill Jones anything. I just went my own way, reporting
                    what I'd learned. At this point, it was a frustrating situation. I had been told
                    when I was in the Department that Rhee was an old man and that I should busy
                    myself trying to find out what the plans were if he kicked off in office because
                    there would be a scramble for power, and how would that be handled. The
                    intelligence people had been given this function, but the embassy had to have
                    somebody looking at it, too. The intelligence people were rotated frequently and
                    usually didn't speak Korean. They had agents who spoke the language, but agents
                    are different from having American officials handling a problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>I remember asking one influential Korean the question, “If Rhee dies, have you
                    guys got any plans?”</p>
                <p>He said, “I don't know, but I'll go find out.” He came back and he told me, “They
                    don't have any plans.”</p>
                <p>I pointed out, “The American Embassy feels you should, because if anything
                    happened, what would...”</p>
                <p>As this all went around and came around, he kept reporting back what he was
                    learning, and I would put it into cables back to the Department. So that kept me
                    pretty busy, doing all this and trying to keep track of Rhee.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, I got involved in giving lectures at some of the universities on
                    anything they asked me. I didn't know what I was talking about, but I'd go look
                    it up and ... lecture on something to someone's kids. I got to know some of
                    these college kids; I could feel, from talking to them, because I was speaking
                    Korean at the time, that they wanted to learn some English; I had a group of
                    people coming to my house to learn English...</p>
                <p>And my girlfriend at the time was helping me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was she Korean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: No, she was American, Catherine M. Frank, a vice consul. We ended up
                    being married in San Francisco in October 1958 as she was en-route from Seoul to
                    the Department. She was a woman Foreign Service officer and had entered in the
                    class of '56. She'd been one of two women officers in a class of 60 appointed to
                    the Foreign Service. She was to be my assistant in the political section, when
                    an older woman, named Maggie Barrett, who'd done this type work, arrived on the
                    scene and became my assistant. I got to read Kay's personnel file; she had a
                    doctorate in political science. Maggie was a lawyer and a CPA and had been a
                    biographic officer in Mexico City for years; she ended up being my assistant in
                    Korea. By that time, I'd come to the conclusion, the only way to go at politics
                    in an Asian country was the biographic approach. Looking at a political party
                    was crazy. You look at people and the interconnections between people. Maggie
                    turned out to be a gemstone.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Kay Frank started teaching these students and talking to them. I felt
                    that Rhee was unpopular. I concluded that sooner or later there was going to be
                    a problem with the students. I kept bringing this up, but nobody would listen to
                    me. You didn't dare put anything on paper, for fear you'd get yourself...
                    Robertson, at that point, had already gotten rid of some young officers in
                    Taiwan who were talking about what was wrong with Chiang Kai-shek. It was not
                    the thing to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>In the meantime, I kept looking around, saying if there is a problem and the Rhee
                    government is in trouble, how are we, as a country, going to be affected by
                    this? And how can we ameliorate our problem?</p>
                <p>My first impression was that in most Asian governments, when you have this
                    situation, whoever they're getting rid of tends to get bumped off. How do you
                    keep that from happening because that would be a big embarrassment to us and
                    create a lot of problems back here for the new people who were taking over
                    there.</p>
                <p>There were always worries of a military coup. I kept very close track of the
                    military. Haverkamp, at an earlier period, had worked with me; he got to know
                    the chief of staff of the army, CHUNG Il Kwan, in a personal way; he went
                    drinking with him and some other generals. I'd gotten to know some generals. I
                    visited and made speeches at various Korean units along the front; out of this,
                    I kept getting to know as many military people as I could.</p>
                <p>I did this on my own because if you talked of a coup or talked of an overthrow of
                    the Rhee government, you were in trouble in Washington. I was thinking this, but
                    I didn't know. Nobody could predict how this would turn out, but I knew there
                    was great dissatisfaction with the corruption in Korea, and it was growing. It
                    would be either the military or, as is the tradition in Asia, the students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, particularly in the spring.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Out of all this, I came to the conclusion that what we needed was an
                    understudy for Rhee, who was close to Rhee, but was also close to the
                    opposition; someone who was fundamentally an honest man. After researching
                    various personalities, I came to the conclusion there was one person who fitted
                    that bill. I'd gotten to know him back in '52 and '53. I'd been a house guest of
                    his when he first moved back into his own home in Seoul, back in '53. I stayed
                    at his house because there was no room in the embassy at the time due to the
                    wedding of Manhard and his wife. I wanted to come to Seoul on business, and the
                    ambassador said, “Well, there's no room here.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I'll find a place to stay.” And I stayed with my friend, Mr. Huh who was
                    an older man. At that time, he must have been then in his '50s, but to me, a man
                    in my '20s, that seemed pretty old. Mr. Huh was younger than Rhee, but had been
                    one of Rhee's...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his full name?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>THOMAS: Huh Chong. Mr. Huh had studied in this country at Columbia University.
                    His English was not too good, but he'd get along with a little bit in English. I
                    dealt with him in Korean at this time because my Korean, by then, was better
                    than his English.</p>
                <p>I liked him, and I liked his wife. He'd been one of those honest people, who'd
                    been the first minister of transportation. Yes, he siphoned money off like
                    everybody did, but it was to pay his employees enough to live on. It wasn't to
                    make himself rich. He went to work on a bicycle, while the others had cars and
                    stole money and had Swiss accounts.</p>
                <p>You could look in the files and find out what Mr. Huh was. Mr. Huh had been in
                    this country back when Rhee was in Washington lobbying for Korea. Mr. Huh had
                    been one of the people who donated money to Rhee, just from what little he made
                    working his way through college. He'd been a Rhee follower. He'd come from a
                    better family down in Kyongsan Nam Do. Kyongsan Nam Do was the birthplace of the
                    Democratic Party, the opposition party. He was one of the five founding members
                    of the Minjudong (Democratic Party), which was the conservative opposition
                    political party to Rhee's Liberal Party. But he still had been fired by Rhee
                    because he didn't really want to go along with some of the corruption, early,
                    even before the Korean War. They hadn't gotten back together. There was still
                    this Confucian loyalty, but at the same time, he was a member of the
                    opposition.</p>
                <p>The city of Seoul was in such bad shape, and there was much pressure from the
                    Americans to get something done about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking what, about '56?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: About '57 maybe '58, I'm guessing now, in that vicinity. Huh was
                    reappointed by Rhee as mayor of Seoul.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, in that period, there was a Korean student going to school in
                    Philadelphia who was mugged and murdered on the streets of Philadelphia. He was
                    from a better Korean family. It caused quite an uproar in Korea. It wasn't
                    nice.</p>
                <p>It struck me, because my father knew the mayor of Philadelphia at the time, that
                    maybe we could do something about that, in terms of making up for it, and at the
                    same time, subtly do something that would set Mr. Huh up, in terms of possibly
                    being the guy who would take over if anything happened to the Rhee
                    government.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>I remember dictating to Maggie Barrett. She used to go on all my trips with me.
                    The first trip, she begged me to take her. She said, “If you let me go on one
                    trip, you'll never go without me.” I used to get back from one of these two- or
                    three-week trips, and there would be a stack of papers I'd have to go through,
                    and I'd have to write a dispatch on everything I'd learned. She took shorthand,
                    and every time we'd stop, she'd stay in the car, then she'd stop me right after
                    I came out from talking to somebody and had me tell her what happened; she'd
                    take it all down. When we came back from the first trip, within two or three
                    days, she had the notes organized into a dispatch. Beautifully organized; she
                    wrote well. She said, “Here's your dispatch. You won't go again without me.” I
                    didn't have to take any time; it was all there, everything I'd learned.</p>
                <p>I wanted to get Maggie promoted, because she was due for it. She was overage.
                    She'd lied about her age and made herself younger than she really was, or she
                    would have been retired by then. This was going to be her last post. I said to
                    Maggie, “From now on, all these dispatches we send back, biographic studies,
                    don't put my name on them, you just put your name. But I'll dictate the comments
                    section. You don't know these people. I know them. But you get it all together,
                    all the facts, from going through all the files. And then I'll dictate my
                    comments.”</p>
                <p>She did one on Huh Chong. I was to write the comments, but my name didn't go on
                    the report, because I wanted to get her promoted. The first sentence I dictated
                    in the comments said “If the Rhee government were to fall, the chances were that
                    Mr. Huh would be the man to take power.” Then I went on to explain why I thought
                    this might be so, in terms of his close relationship to Rhee and the chances of
                    his making sure that nothing happened to Rhee, etc., if that were the case. That
                    was sent to Washington, but, like any document, it just went into the files; it
                    also went into our files at the embassy. That ended that, for the time
                    being.</p>
                <p>I kept writing stuff, but it was all the usual crap. You couldn't go into
                    anything of any importance, because the place was getting worse and worse all
                    the time.</p>
                <p>I remember being called one time and dictating a memo that they told me about
                    later... I'm trying to think of this man, and maybe you can think of his name.
                    (It was Kim Chong-p'il) He was the intelligence chief after Gen. Park Chung Hee
                    took power. He had been the real organizer of the coup for Park Chung Hee at
                    that time. This was after I left there. But somebody came back and mentioned
                    that when they looked at my files in the political section after I had gone,
                    there was a memo I'd written saying that this man, Kim Chong-p'il, had called me
                    on the phone and asked to meet me. I didn't know who he was. He asked to meet me
                    at the U.N. Cemetery on a Sunday afternoon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The U.N. Cemetery...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Across the river from Seoul.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Across the Han.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I remember going and standing around there, waiting for this man to
                    approach me because it was to be a blind thing. He never showed. He'd given me
                    his name, and so it was all in the files that I'd gone to meet him. It turned
                    out, that this guy was the guy that later ran the coup that put Park Chung Hee
                    in power. It came up at that time, because they looked up his name and here was
                    this memo I'd written.</p>
                <p>Anyway, just before I left Korea in '58... and by then I was convinced we were
                    going to have a shake-up in the Korean government and that Rhee was going to go,
                    one way or the other. Whether it would be the military or the students, I
                    couldn't say, but it was just a matter of time.</p>
                <p>I went to see Mr. Huh and told him this. I told him that if anything went wrong,
                    I felt that he was probably the best person to handle the interim situation.
                    Furthermore I was going back to the United States and was going to try to get
                    him invited to do a tour of the United States, on which I would try to accompany
                    him. This would be a way of getting him known and also sending a signal to
                    President Rhee. He said, “All right, if you can do that.”</p>
                <p>I came back to the States and I talked to my Dad about the fact that it was very
                    sad about the killing of this Korean boy; that it had created terrible feelings
                    in Korea. He knew Mayor Dilworth, and it would be sort of appropriate, on the
                    anniversary, whatever it was, maybe the first anniversary, or the second, I
                    forget, of this kid's being killed, that he invite the mayor of Seoul to be the
                    guest of the mayor of Philadelphia, to commemorate the boy's death and to make
                    an apology on the part of Philadelphia for this. It would be helpful to
                    American-Korean relations. This idea was presented to Dilworth who thought it
                    was a good idea. All it cost Philadelphia was the price of three airplane
                    tickets because he could get free hotel space from the hotel owners. I then
                    suggested that maybe if he could broker this to the cities of New York,
                    Washington, Chicago and San Francisco because the costs to these cities would be
                    small because Mr. Huh and his party could stop on their way back. He'd get a
                    chance to visit these cities and each mayor would welcome him, it would be
                    worthwhile. Fortunately, everybody agreed.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, I came back to the Department; I'm preaching at the working
                    level, and I'm waiting to go into Chinese-language school. It was all set up for
                    me to study Chinese because I couldn't stay in Korea all the rest of my life. I
                    wanted to take leave; language school was going to start two months or a month
                    later. Anyway, I'm preaching this stuff about Korea. I remember David Bane. Do
                    you know David Bane?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It doesn't ring a bell.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>THOMAS: I remember David Bane was director of NEA. He had been in and out of the
                    Department, I think with some of the oil companies, and he was a rather
                    sophisticated guy. He ended up later in Pakistan as consul general in Lahore.
                    But at that time David was head of NEA. I remember telling David that Rhee was
                    in trouble; his response was you better keep your mouth shut or you'll get
                    yourself fired if it gets to Mr. Robertson that the Rhee government's not long
                    for this world. I said, “You watch, you watch.”</p>
                <p>In the meantime, Mr. Huh was invited to Philadelphia; I took leave, and traveled
                    around with him. We went to Philadelphia, New York, Washington, Chicago and San
                    Francisco; it took about ten days or a bit more for this tour. In New York we
                    called on General MacArthur at his apartment. The newspaper reported the story
                    about this call on MacArthur and how this visit by Mayor Huh of Seoul was in
                    commemoration of the student's being killed in Philadelphia. It was also
                    reported that Mr. Thomas from the State Department was accompanying the mayor,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>When the word reached President Rhee, you can guess what happened to Mr. Huh when
                    he returned to Seoul. He was fired, right there on the spot. He was out of a
                    job. In the interim, Rhee started to make trouble for Ambassador Dowling back
                    here. He was called back for consultation. Kay, my wife was assigned to INR on
                    the Korean desk. I told her about those “bio reports of long ago, 1952, which
                    told about Rhee's use of political connections on the extreme right in Congress.
                    They were top secret. She located them; put them in her purse, took them to the
                    Korea desk in the department and gave them to Dowling. They were the ammunition
                    he needed to protect himself. She was later reprimanded by her boss in INR; he
                    claimed that by doing it informally the INR desk didn't get credit. Those
                    reports, if handled formally, would never have gotten to Dowling. They were too
                    hot and too politically dangerous.</p>
                <p>Over a year later after HUH's trip here, the student situation starts to boil up.
                    (I was in language school at the time.) Rhee was worried. Yi Ki-pung is the guy
                    whom I helped elect Chairman of the National Assembly. His son, who had been
                    adopted by Rhee to give Rhee an heir, ended up shooting the whole family,
                    committing a family suicide. The Vice President, who was Chang Myon, had
                    resigned; so you had no vice president. The third man in line, according to the
                    constitution, was the speaker of the National Assembly. He was dead, killed by
                    his own son; then the son took his own life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did he do that? Was it a family thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>THOMAS: It had to do with loss of face, in terms of Rhee. Rhee was losing power.
                    It was obvious that this thing was going to blow up in Rhee's face. Somebody had
                    to take the blame. They thought, by killing themselves, it'd take the blame from
                    Rhee. Okay? Well, it didn't accomplish that, but that was the object. As a
                    matter of fact, some of the relatives of Yi Ki-pung, who are alive today,
                    accused me of having been responsible for his death, having had him made speaker
                    of the Assembly, because he really wasn't meant for that job. It was too rough a
                    place for him.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the Korean constitution stated that, if you have no speaker of the
                    National Assembly, the next person in line is the foreign minister. Suddenly,
                    Rhee appointed Mr. Huh Chong foreign minister. The Rhee government fell. Mr. Huh
                    took power as acting president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Falls because of the student revolt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: The police refused to fire on their own children; besides the people were
                    fed up at this point.</p>
                <p>The day Mr. Huh took power as acting president, he called me on the telephone,
                    and asked if he could go to the ambassador and ask that I be brought out there.
                    I said, “Let me do that from this end.” We had a new ambassador, named
                    McConaughy, at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a creature of the right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Oh, very.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the United States. Very much a strong supporter of
                        Chiang Kai-shek. A Walter Robertson favorite, I'd say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: That's right. Anyway, he won the argument; I wasn't needed.</p>
                <p>Mr. Huh took power at this point. He made sure Rhee wasn't killed. Rhee was flown
                    out of the country and sent to Honolulu. I tried to talk the American government
                    at that point into backing him, rather than Chang Myon, because I said, “Chang
                    Myon is a weakling. This man is a strong man, if you'll back him. He's not an
                    ambitious man, but if you'll back him, you've got somebody... He won't do what
                    you tell him. He'll do what he thinks is right for Korea. It's very dangerous
                    putting somebody in there who'd do what you tell him.” But they wanted somebody
                    to do what he was told. Chang Myon was put in power and did what he was told,
                    but in the end, people got so fed up with him that the military...</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>After Chang Myon was elected president, I would go to the Korean Desk to read the
                    incoming cables; I kept telling people, “There's going to be a military coup.”
                    This was obvious to me because certain senior military officers were being
                    transferred and where they were being transferred. But nobody listened. At this
                    point, I was shipped out to Taichung and that was it.</p>
                <p>That was my experience in Korea. There's probably a lot of stuff left out because
                    this is a broad...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you think of things, I'm going to give you this, in

                </p>
                <p>(In retrospect, one can now understand the makings of the self-inflicted
                    political problems we created in American-Korean relations for the next thirty
                    years. At its foundation was the extreme right wing dogma of the self righteous
                    Republican administration of the 1950's. Secretary Dulles and Walter Robertson
                    were responsible for years to come, Central America, the Middle East, Iran,
                    Vietnam, Afghanistan, and the failure to understand what was happening in the
                    Soviet Union all, in time, were products of this failure to look for and try to
                    understand the “truth”. Dogma has little time for the truth. The CIA in Korea is
                    a good example; its personnel were there in many guises but mostly under
                    military cover. The U.S. Army in the early years was the more bureaucratically
                    powerful in intelligence matters. The Korean Army's Intelligence Detachments
                    worked closely with U.S. Command's G-2. ROK CIC under Snake Kim was a personal
                    political intelligence arm of Rhee as was Gen. Won Yong-tok's Provost Marshal
                    Command. CIA was new and inexperienced, in the Asian sense, and had a new group
                    of players there. In the period from 1956-58 they were deeply involved in
                    establishing the Korean CIA. In hindsight, they wanted an organization of their
                    own making with which they could have a liaison. Rhee's two organizations did
                    not fill the bill. The Agency was becoming bureaucratic like the State
                    Department. After the East Asia hands in State were crucified, career European
                    hands were made ambassadors to East Asian countries. The book “A Pretty Good
                    Club”, based on a Harvard doctoral dissertation by Martin Weil, clearly outlines
                    how this happened. It was the legacy of the old career diplomats from Europe in
                    league with the Japan hands in the Department. The last of these were the Dulles
                    brothers who became their instruments. One can see the power of old and
                    inherited wealth at work in the failed policies that held sway for the past
                    forty years. To allow such policies to remain viable requires a system that is
                    favorable to their long term existence. Such a system requires that the
                    “organization man” be king; otherwise, such policies could and would not be
                    viable. True experts on a society and a country would and could not go along
                    with such policies. Thus, in both the Foreign Service and the CIA a culture
                    which favored the “Organization Man” over the man of substance took over. The

                <p>The CIA policies in Korea are a good example. In creating the ROK CIA with which
                    they could have a liaison, they created a situation where knowledge of Korea and
                    its language were not only not needed but a hindrance. Only an “organization
                    man” would and could fit the required mold. Through this mirror image, called
                    the KCIA, a series of questionable generals usurped power. For the U.S. in
                    Korea, it is now coming home to roost. Dogma is the weapon of wealthy special
                    interests, who then and now are connected to wealthy interests in places such as
                    Haiti, Guatemala, etc.. Note the CIA's record in those two countries. Can an
                    organization with roots as described in a recent book “The Secret War Against
                    The Jews” ever become truly effective, or is it a prisoner of its own inherited
                    values. Is it possible for the Foreign Service, with its questionable
                    inheritance, to become truly expert on the foreign policy problems we face? Or,
                    will it continue to be a bureaucracy designed to carry on in the traditions
                    formed and instilled prior to, during and subsequent to WWII? It would appear
                    that “Dogma” is alive and well in our new congress. Note the latest questionable
                    policy adjustments concerning Cuba in order to please Senator Helms and the
                    extreme right in this country. (Early March 1996).)</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took Chinese for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Nearly three years. The first year, off and on, because of being involved
                    with Korean affairs. Then two full years at Taichung, where I ended up being
                    acting director of the language school.</p>
                <p>I found much that was wrong with how the system allowed linguistic scientists to
                    select which candidates would study Oriental languages. In earlier times,
                    officers who had proven themselves as competent in relating to the peoples of
                    East Asia, and who would be more effective with the language as a tool, were
                    seen as eligible for this major investment in time and money. To select
                    inexperienced officers on the basis of language aptitude alone can create
                    competent interpreters, but excellent interpreters can be hired at much lower
                    salaries. Many of these people learned easily, but found East Asia not to their
                    liking, and spent their free time at the local American military officers clubs.
                    The investment was a waste of money. (This changed approach to the selection of
                    language officers fitted in well with the demise of “men of substance” and the
                    substitution of “the organization man”.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: But if you want effective political and economic officers, they'd better
                    know the language.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>To keep that from happening, you must not let them decide who is given language
                    training only based on language aptitude tests. We've got to say to them, “Here
                    we've got an officer we know is damn good at developing productive relationships
                    with the Chinese people (Gwanshi); he's done such a good job, we want you to
                    teach him Chinese. Now it might take him six months longer than it takes
                    somebody else to learn the same amount of language. We don't care. You train
                    him.” But that's what's needed in terms of developing effective diplomats.</p>
                <p>I saw this phenomenon during my period at Taichung. In the end, however, I ended
                    up getting a 4 in reading, and a 3+ in spoken, which is pretty good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, it's very good. Just for the record, 5 is a native
                        speaker. It's a two thing: 1 through 5 (5 being the highest) for reading;
                        and 1 through 5 for speaking.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: You've got to be a college graduate in that country, native speaker, to
                    get a 5.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the normal person going to this is lucky to get a
                        3.3.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: That's right. I remember, because I was running this school for six
                    months at the same time as I was a student. The teachers all liked me. Because I
                    was the acting headmaster or whatever you want to call it, principal or
                    director, FSI here worried that there might be favoritism. They brought in Don
                    Sergle to replace me, who'd by then graduated from there and was head of USIS in
                    Taichung. He took over the school from me just at the time I was to graduate. He
                    was then acting director the week of my graduation. He had to sit in, actually
                    sit in, while I took my oral, and sit in while I took my written which had been
                    sent to him from FSI in Washington. He sealed both the written and the tape of
                    my oral and sent them to Washington to be graded. This was done because I'd been
                    acting director of the school, and there was a possible conflict of
                    interest.</p>
                <p>But a scandal occurred due to me, after I left there, that I felt very badly
                    about. I want to get it on record now because I want this issue to be
                    addressed.</p>
                <p>I had always taken the attitude that when you're dealing with people who have
                    less than you do, you try to be helpful to them. When I left there, I sold
                    things that I didn't want or need any longer (like I'd had some carpets made for
                    my house locally, inexpensive stuff), to some of the teachers at a discount
                    price. They were low-paid people. I sold them my bicycle at a discount price. I
                    tried to be decent to these people who'd busted their ass teaching me. I'd come
                    to know, and encouraged the other students to get to know them in a very social
                    and personal way.</p>
                <p>They got a new guy in, a few weeks after I left there, who was to be the new
                    director, who spoke Chinese, but he was from a missionary background.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>In the meantime, the head teacher of the school had saved up a fair amount of
                    money in dollars and given it to me. He liked hi-fi's; he asked me to buy him a
                    hi-fi when I got back and send it through APO. Well, this was against the rules.
                    There's no doubt about that. But every one of us broke rules that way. You
                    couldn't be in the Foreign Service and not. We're constantly giving whiskey away
                    to people.</p>
                <p>There was a fellow, with the initials L.N. who was with the USIS, there in
                    language schooLN and his wife had befriended us and thrown a big party for us as
                    we were leaving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you married by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Oh, yes, my wife was there. We had to pay money to get her trained in
                    Chinese, because the government wouldn't do it at that time. We spent a fair
                    amount of money giving her language lessons; she learned Chinese along with me.
                    She's a better linguist, but, of course, she didn't cover the amount that I
                    had.</p>
                <p>Anyway, as I remember it now, I asked LN, “Would you mind being the recipient of
                    this hi-fi gear for Mr. Lin? He's given me the money, and I'm going to pick it
                    up at the PX up in Tokyo and put it in the APO for you, and when it gets here,
                    just give it to him.” Which is what happened.</p>
                <p>However, it turned out LN was not a good linguist, and he didn't bust his ass
                    like I did. He was a social animal. He and his wife liked to party. That's why
                    we had good times with them; they were always having parties. He was flunking
                    out of the school. He thought he'd pull a blackmail on Lin, the head instructor
                    —”I've got this stuff, etc. etc.”</p>
                <p>Then this whole thing came out, that I'd sent this stuff; therefore, Thomas got
                    these high grades. There was no way I got a high grade... it all originated and
                    was graded back here. So nobody in Washington or at the school, who knew the
                    facts, believed that.</p>
                <p>This new missionary type said, “Well, from now on, there'll be no fraternization
                    between the students and the teachers.” Couldn't even go to a party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The kiss of death.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Kiss of death. The whole place was terrible. I heard all about it via the
                    letters people were writing me. They fired the senior instructor. He got booted
                    because of all this. LN, in the end, because he'd played this hardnose thing,
                    graduated, but I don't think he was ever very good at Chinese. But they never
                    dared show their faces to me again, those two. Yet we'd been close friends
                    there. They're here in Washington. A very sad ending!</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I graduated in '62. First of all, I was due to go to Hong Kong, in the
                    economic section. There was somebody in Hong Kong that had been in Korea that
                    didn't like me. I don't know who, but I made my enemies.</p>
                <p>First of all, there was the commissary issue in Korea. The married couples all
                    wanted a limit so that no servants were to be allowed in the commissary to buy
                    for the single people. The fresh vegetables and other items in short supply came
                    in at ten o'clock in the morning and were put on the shelves, and they were gone
                    in a matter of a couple of hours. Our servants were over there to get them for
                    us, along with the wives. The wives didn't like standing in line with our
                    servants. They should get VIP treatment. If that happened, single people
                    wouldn't get any of the fresh vegetables. Since single people were the majority
                    in the embassy, they could outvote everybody. That's why I was president of the
                    Embassy Club. The ambassador put out an order that the servants couldn't shop at
                    the commissary any longer. I said, “All right, I can't buck the ambassador.” But
                    I quietly went to this Korean manager, since I was his boss as president of the
                    club, and I said, “Look, I want the stuff split. I want two-thirds of it not put
                    on the shelves until six in the evening, the fresh stuff. One-third at ten in
                    the morning because about one-third of the embassy is married. Two-thirds are
                    single. That's the way it's to be split everything that comes in. If it runs out
                    in the morning, you haven't got any more.” That's what he did. Of course, that
                    made me unpopular as hell over there with some of the married couples. But
                    that's the way it worked.</p>
                <p>Then the married people got together and tried to run somebody against me to
                    become president. It didn't work. They got something through that I couldn't
                    succeed myself; we got another single person in there as president. This type
                    thing went on.</p>
                <p>I was back in the Department, and informal word comes back to me that somebody
                    didn't want me in Hong Kong. You know how that works in the damn system. It can
                    cause all types of problems.Then there was talk of sending me to Taipei. A
                    similar thing happened in Taipei; somebody didn't want me there. (I didn't fit
                    as an “Organization Man” and substance types can be a problem for the
                    system.)</p>
                <p>Then they decided to open up a new China affairs post for a Chinese-affairs
                    officer in Karachi, Pakistan. Pakistan Internal Airlines had gone into China.
                    They had a Chinese-affairs officer in Delhi. The guy who had been chief of the
                    political section in Hong Kong, Jake, had that job. He'd been transferred to
                    Delhi. That was a pretty senior job in the Chinese-affairs reporting business,
                    because of India. I was given the Chinese-affairs post for two countries:
                    Pakistan and Afghanistan. I was assigned to the political section in
                    Pakistan.</p>

                <p>THOMAS: Sixty-three to '65. That was a very interesting period; I had real
                    problems there. That was a period when China and Pakistan became very close. My
                    biggest fights were with the chief of the political section and with the

                <p>THOMAS: His judgement. A fellow that did his writing for him, Dick Sneider, who
                    was later ambassador to Korea... Did you know Dick Sneider?</p>

                    very well with Sneider because Sneider was doing just exactly what he was told
                    by McConaughy. I was an effective political officer; I got to know a lot of
                    people in Pakistan, fast. Sneider was not very good socially at handling
                    himself. He was sort of abrupt, and people didn't take to this.</p>

                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>THOMAS: He was chief of the political section; yet he hadn't made many friends in
                    the diplomatic corps there. He was sort of negative; he tended to lord it over
                    people. You know how you make calls when you first get to a post? He put out a
                    memo that none of us were to call on anybody, in any of the other embassies,
                    senior in rank to us. I was a senior second secretary, but most foreign
                    embassies in Pakistan didn't even have second secretaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, they had just one person, and that was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: A first secretary, or maybe a charg�, or maybe a minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe quite a junior officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: That's right. The word was out in the diplomatic community that there was
                    a China linguist assigned to do the Chinese-affairs reporting job in the
                    American Embassy. Yet I was told I couldn't call on anybody. Well, I soon said,
                    “I'll cure that.” I just started telling any junior officer I could, from any
                    other embassy, that this was a problem for me because I was hamstrung by my own
                    political chief, who wouldn't let me meet anybody; that I'd like to get to know
                    anybody else who knew anything about China or Chinese. It turned out the
                    Canadian minister there, who was the deputy chief of the Canadian mission, was a
                    China linguist; I think married to a Chinese. The French Embassy had the same
                    situation as did the Australian Embassy. All these guys, who were number two in
                    their embassies, came around and called on me. You can imagine Sneider's
                    reaction.</p>
                <p>We formed a China club, with me as the president. They asked if they could bring
                    their dispatches and talk to me when they were writing about China, and we'd
                    trade information. Out of this, I got to know as many... Karachi became a small
                    Hong Kong. I talked to anybody coming though on PIA going to China. At the same
                    time, I got to know the Pakistani people.</p>
                <p>Not many diplomats hunt. Here you're in a military society in a place like
                    Pakistan. I'd read Thayer. Remember Charlie Thayer's books, “Bears in the
                    Caviar”, and all? He'd been posted out in that part of the world; he got along
                    because he could ride and hunt and that type thing. Word got to the agricultural
                    attach� in our embassy, Dr. Varney, a very nice man as was his wife, that I
                    hunted. He'd been dean of an agricultural college in West Virginia and owned a
                    big farm up in Vermont, I think, on Lake Champlain, a big dairy farm. He was a
                    hunter; he invited me to accompany him on a hunt, with a man named Pir Pagaro.
                    Have you ever been to Pakistan?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I never have.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>THOMAS: Pir Pagaro is an hereditary pir. The book “The Saints of the Sindh” (I
                    forget the author.) tells about his father. His father was the pir of the tribe
                    called the Hurs, a bandit group that live in Rajasthan and in the Sindh deserts.
                    There might be a million or two of them. Back in the days of the British raj, at
                    the beginning of World War II, Pir Pagaro, the old pir, was not happy with the
                    British, and with a war coming on, he wanted to get out from under them; he was
                    going to run a small revolt.</p>
                <p>The story was told that the British political officer there went out to his
                    palace at Larkana and said, “I understand you're an absolute ruler.”</p>
                <p>The pir called some peasant forward and told him to kneel down. He knelt down,
                    and the pir cut his head off, right there in front of the British political
                    officer, saying to himself, “He'll see what I am here.”</p>
                <p>In the end, the British went to war against him, bombed his palace, and, I think,
                    hanged him. They took his two sons, the eldest being the hereditary pir, and
                    sent them off to England to be students, to learn English and the British
                    ways.</p>
                <p>In '47 or '48, after partition, the Paks were having a hell of a time keeping
                    peace in the Sindh, and they needed that pir back. They went to the British and
                    said, “Help, we've got to have that Pir back here, to get control.” So the Pir
                    was sent back, as a young person, to take command. He was the secular and the
                    religious leader of this tribe. Historically, the Hurs had been Bedouin people
                    who'd come out of Saudi Arabia nine generations earlier; they lived on camelback
                    and on horseback, in the desert. The new Pir, having gone, I think, to Oxford,
                    and his brother to Cambridge, were returned to this tribal people.</p>
                <p>Dr. Varney, the agricultural attach�, invited me to go along with him on a hunt
                    with this guy, Pir Pagaro. I didn't know anything about him; he had a big, full
                    beard. At that time, I just had a moustache; I didn't have this goatee. It was
                    my first hunt in Pakistan, a five-day hunt. I took leave and we went up into the
                    mountains. It was a very impressive experience for a westerner. You ride up in
                    these mountains on camelback; you climb over a rise, and there, down below you,
                    were all these massive tents that are as tall as a two story house. On entering
                    the tents, there are Persian rugs on the ground, a big double bed and other
                    furnishings. This is gentlemen's hunting.</p>
                <p>We're hunting for Ibex, which is a high mountain goat.</p>
                <p>I had borrowed a rifle. My own rifles hadn't arrived yet. I was brand new there;
                    I hadn't been there but about a couple of weeks. Someone at the Embassy, who
                    really wasn't a hunter but had lived in Germany, had bought an F. N. Browning
                    with double triggers, but with open sites. The rifle came with telescopic
                    sights, but he'd lost the telescope; all it had was open sites. It was a very
                    finely built, hand-finished rifle. He loaned it to me to go on this hunt.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>We arrived at the site for the hunt in the mountains; The Pakistani members of
                    the hunting party started shooting these automatic weapons at running Ibex. I
                    wasn't about to do that. I just stood and watched the action. It was like a
                    machine gun war. At last, after all these young, little ibex, none of whom were
                    hit, were gone, I looked down, way down in this valley, and there was this big
                    old male, standing there, looking up at us on the mountaintop. I got down on my
                    belly and aimed the rifle. The Ibex is so far away that the bead on the front
                    site just about covered the animal. I was hunting with a 110-grain bullet, which
                    is a very lightweight bullet. It's a 30.06 rifle. I'm firing downhill. A
                    110-grain, because of the lightweight bullet, has a pretty straight trajectory.
                    This is probably about a 500 yards shot, which is pretty far. With a double
                    trigger, all you had to do is touch it. Lying on the ground I fired. I thought
                    “If I hit it, I've got it made. If I don't, what the hell.” The shot resounded
                    and the animal fell.</p>
                <p>This occurred during my first two or three weeks in Pakistan. The pir's bodyguard
                    was a Pathan, who stood seven feet two inches tall and wore a turban. If you
                    know the Pathans, they come out of the northwest territory. Their code of ethics
                    is that you judge a man by how well he shoots a rifle because they all carry
                    rifles all the time, up there in Peshawar. As I went to get up, the pir took my
                    rifle from me, and this Pathan, instead of helping me up, just picked me up and
                    threw me in the air and as he caught me in his arms, he screamed, “Sahib, what a
                    shot!” in this booming voice... I was my present size. From then on, I had it
                    made with that hunting crowd. It was, frankly, a lucky shot.</p>
                <p>It turned out that the pir's biggest enemy in the Sindh was a man named Bhutto.
                    Bhutto was a Sindhi. Bhutto was the foreign minister. Bhutto was a hedonist who
                    screwed the wives of all his deputies. He was a lech. He was in the eyes of
                    normal Muslims an immoral man. Anyway, Bhutto was Pir Pagaro's big enemy.</p>
                <p>We went back to Pir Pagaro's palace after that hunt. We got back late afternoon
                    and he invited us to have dinner. Everybody treated this guy like a king.</p>
                <p>First of all, when we got into his Land Rover, I noticed that he always drove,
                    which he didn't do in the city. I always rode next to him. He decided who sat
                    where. I felt very badly, because this much older man, Dr. Varney, would have to
                    sit in the back. But the pir always insisted I sit up front with him. That was
                    the more comfortable seat. (I learned later why the Pir drove his own Land Rover
                    when on the hunt where he was surrounded by his own people, the Hurs. It seems
                    that they resent anyone but a westerner sitting on the same level as the Pir. It
                    seems earlier several drivers were killed because of this issue. Thus he always
                    drove himself and no one but a foreigner was asked to sit with him. Even when on
                    the hunt he, Dr. Varney and I were the only ones sitting on chairs in his tent.
                    Even Pak Cabinet ministers sat on the floor when in his presence if we were
                    among the Hurs.)You did what the pir wanted. I apologized to Varney, and he
                    said, “Don't worry about it. I don't care. I just love this hunting. To go
                    hunting with this guy is great.”</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>When we arrived at his home, there was a big dining room. The table must have
                    been 30-feet long; it was a big sheet of glass, about an inch and a half thick,
                    that went the whole length of the room. The Pir was seated at the head of the
                    table, and I was seated at the pir's right, Varney at his left. There was nobody
                    else seated until you reached the other end. Down there were a bunch of guys in
                    turbans, bandoleers with bullets, and rifles, the big bodyguard and some of his
                    henchmen, maybe half a dozen of them. The Pir was still very formal with me; I
                    didn't know what to do, but I didn't like this situation because the pir was not
                    that old; he looked about my age. I looked at the Pir, and I said, “You know,
                    Pir, if I had to eat every dinner with those guys at the other end of the table,
                    I'd want a glass-topped table, too.” He just burst out laughing. He told this
                    joke to these guys in Sindhi. They laughed, too. I don't know if they really
                    thought it was funny, but he nearly fell out of his chair because of this crack.
                    He thought it was very funny. That broke the ice, and he said, “Well, you know,
                    my name is...” I forget what, but I always called him pir sahib, anyway.</p>
                <p>I said, “My name's Fred.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Fred, I'd like you to advise me on politics. I'm never going into
                    politics as a candidate, but I want to be a power in the Sindh. I want to be a
                    power in this country, in the National Assembly.”</p>
                <p>So I said, “Well, sure.”</p>
                <p>At the same time, there was a Foreign Service officer in the embassy named Don
                    Gelber. Do you know Gelber?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I don't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: He was a bright young man, had a hell of a good sense of humor, and a
                    nice wife, who was from a Turkish Jewish community in Turkey. I never could
                    understand the Department's assigning Jews to political sections in Muslim
                    countries, especially ones like Pakistan. Here you had the chief of the
                    political section was a Jew, and you had Gelber. I'm being given hell most of
                    the time by my boss, but Gelber spent all his time working on a Master's Degree
                    thesis. He hardly turned in anything because, first of all, he had no contacts
                    in the community, his being Jewish. He was bright; he could write musicals. He
                    was a very talented guy and funny, and he'd write very funny stuff. But he
                    didn't know how to get along with the local people. He wasn't around them; he
                    just went home to his wife.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>After this first trip with Pir Pagaro, I wrote up everything I learned, in a
                    memcon about politics there, and the fact that the Pir wanted me to go with him.
                    I got an agreement out of the political chief that I'd go hunting with the Pir
                    whenever I wanted to, with no leave taken. I didn't have to take leave, because
                    local politics wasn't my job.</p>
                <p>I told the Pir I was interested in Chinese matters, and if he could obtain some
                    information concerning China for me, I'd appreciate it. I'd be willing to give
                    him advice on current politics in Pakistan, if I could be of help.</p>
                <p>Every Sunday morning, if we weren't out hunting, he'd either be at my house or
                    I'd be at his house, having coffee and talking local politics.</p>
                <p>Then another thing happened. It turned out that he's like a lot of South Asians;
                    they believe in soothsayers or fortune tellers. There was an Indian who was his
                    fortune teller. Early in the game, the Pir asked me my date of birth, the exact
                    day and the year. It turned out I was born on the same day of the year he was,
                    only a year earlier. This soothsayer told him that a diplomat was going to come
                    to Pakistan, who was born on the same day of the year, who was going to make all
                    the difference in his career, politically, and that he should use this man for
                    advice. This put me in a rather special situation with Pir Pagaro.</p>
                <p>I'm expected to understand local politics. First of all, I don't know anything
                    about local politics. Before I can advise the Pir, he and some of his people
                    have to tutor me on the local situation. They've got to tell me all the
                    background. I'm learning all this background and dictating it in memcoms, but
                    it's not my job to get it to Washington.</p>
                <p>This resulted in a funny story because many months later, a cable from Washington
                    about Gelber's reporting, stating, “This reporting is excellent, but there are
                    no backup memcons. Where are the memcons for all these cables?” All this stuff
                    is going in by cable. We want to see... Well, they'd gotten word, through the
                    grapevine, and I don't know who, because I didn't care, but somebody'd let them
                    know. I think it was another guy who had gone home early and told them that all
                    this stuff was coming from me. Then Sneider (Sneider was part of the problem)
                    was forced, along with Gelber, to package up all my memcons and send them back
                    to the Department, because it became very obvious that I was the guy furnishing
                    all this information. The Pir had his spies everywhere.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, I got to know a man named Jimmy Fancy who was an Ismaili. He was
                    one of the leaders of the Fancy Clan all of whom were Ismailis. The Ismailis
                    were headed by that fellow they weigh in gold, the Aga Khan. He was one of the
                    Aga Khan's followers.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>I can still remember telling Fancy, one night during dinner, about one of my
                    hunting trips with Pir Pagaro, when, out in the middle of the desert, my boiled
                    drinking water had been lost. The reason it had been lost was the people who
                    were transporting it thought it was my liquor, and they didn't want me to have
                    liquor. But the Pir had told me, “You bring your liquor. I can't drink it,
                    because it's against the Muslim code. But most of these people will, on the
                    hunt, and you have it...” The person who had left my water behind thought that
                    it was liquor; it was really water. The liquor got there, but the water didn't.
                    I complained to the Pir. He sent around a case of Evian water, how civilized!
                    out there in the middle of the damned desert. I thought this was pretty
                    plush.</p>
                <p>I told this story to Jimmy Fancy. Later, when the Aga Khan arrived for one of his
                    visits, I got a call from Jimmy Fancy, “Hey, would you get in touch with the Pir
                    and obtain some Evian water for the Aga Khan?” The Pir responded by sending me
                    several cases which I sent on to Jimmy Fancy.</p>
                <p>It turned out that Jimmy Fancy, who ran this big industrial complex, one of the
                    biggest in Pakistan, said to me, “Look, I can't afford, in a country like this,
                    to go without having spies everywhere. I have my own intelligence system. I'm
                    sure that I know more about what goes on here than most of your embassy. Fred,
                    I'm willing to keep you informed, if you'd like.” He came to like me. I received
                    all this domestic political information from either Jimmy Fancy, or Pir Pagaro,
                    while, at the same time, giving Pir Pagaro advice.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, there was somebody who was working in the foreign ministry, who
                    was close to the Pir, and who was telling the Pir stuff out of school. The Pir
                    was willing to tell me who the man was, but I really didn't want to know because
                    I knew that this information would go over like a lead balloon in our embassy.
                    They might try to hurt this guy. If I didn't know, I could protect the source
                    and still get away with what I was trying to accomplish. It became very obvious
                    to me that Bhutto was in bed with the Chinese Communists. Kennedy was the
                    president when we first arrived in Pakistan; I felt he was a breath of fresh air
                    - after years of knee jerk anti-communism under the Republicans. Maybe, I could
                    sell the idea to the Kennedy administration of using Pakistan as a bridge to
                    China. It was my analysis that Pakistan based on the realities of geography and
                    the size of India, had to have a close relationship with China. There is no way
                    around it. Since India was Pakistan's biggest enemy, there was no way Pakistan
                    was not going to make friends with China. We ought to use this situation rather
                    than trying to fight it, in spite of the fact that Pakistan was in CENTO and
                    SEATO. At that time there was a big argument going on among China specialists
                    over whether the Sino Soviet split was for real. I believed it was for real and
                    that we should look to using Pakistan as a bridge to establishing relations with
                    China. But here you've got McConaughy, whose views reflected those of the
                    extreme right in Congress... And Bowles is down in...Delhi pushing the India
                    card.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chester Bowles.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>THOMAS: Chester Bowles is down in...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: New Delhi, as our ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I had to go to Delhi fairly regularly, because I was ordered there by the
                    Department, to confer with Jake, who was the Chinese-affairs officer for India.
                    I have to give you this flashback because it tied in with my relationship with
                    the embassy in Delhi. Prior to leaving Washington for Pakistan, I went to the
                    Department's travel office to make arrangements. I told the woman there that we
                    had just had a new baby girl (Veronica), our second child. The baby was about
                    six months old, and we wanted to go by ship. Because of this situation, I was
                    not interested in going first class in a third-class stateroom in the hole. I'd
                    rather fly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They would call something first class, but it would be
                        down in the bowels of the ship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: That's right. So I said, “If you can't give me true first-class
                    accommodations, I want to fly. If you can give me first-class accommodations
                    going to Naples,” (then I'd fly out of Rome on to Pakistan.)</p>
                <p>She said, “You're going to have to wait, because it's lowest first-class
                    available.”</p>
                <p>A week or so before we were to go, she called me in and said, “I've got you a
                    cabin on the sun deck, with a big picture window.” And she showed me
                    pictures.</p>
                <p>I said, “That's fine.”</p>
                <p>We boarded The Constitution with some of my friends in New York. We went to our
                    first dinner, in the first-class dining room. It was just for couples; they had
                    baby sitters for the young babies. We were seated at a table with another
                    couple. It turned out he was going out to be counselor for administration in
                    Delhi. His name was Bob Francis. He was a big, heavy fellow, but had a good
                    sense of humor. It turned out he was a hunter, and we got along fine. But, of
                    course, he was down in the hole. He introduced me to some ambassador who was
                    going to eastern Europe, who was down in the hole also. We got to be friends on
                    that trip, for the two weeks we were on it. He said, “You get down to Delhi,
                    you've got to come and see us and stay with us.”</p>
                <p>Every time I went to Delhi, I'd stay with him and his wife at their place.
                    Counselors for Administration live pretty well. He and his wife had become the
                    Bowles's closest personal friends in the embassy. Mrs. Bowles was always
                    dropping over for coffee. Jake, the Chinese Affairs Officer there, was due to
                    leave; Jake's tour was up.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>Do you know Paul Kreisberg?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Paul Kreisberg, I heard later, had wanted that job, and Bowles didn't
                    want him. I don't know what the reason was, but Bowles said no. Here we had
                    another China specialist, because Kreisberg was a Chinese linguist, being sent
                    to Pakistan as deputy chief of the political section, to replace the guy who was
                    caught in Iran, who was charg�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bruce Laingen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Bruce had been deputy chief, and the buffer between me and Sneider. Bruce
                    understood I was trying to get the truth out. He was a sensitive and honest
                    person and was so different from Sneider. Sneider was always raising hell with
                    me about something. In my opinion, it was an aggressive posture taken in order
                    to discourage my trying to get something out concerning China that they didn't
                    want to approve.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: McConaughy was a China hand, too, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Yes, he was a China hand, but he didn't speak Chinese. But he was a China
                    hand. He'd been in China a good deal of the time. He spoke a little Chinese, but
                    not enough to count.</p>
                <p>Anyway, while in Delhi, Bowles's wife, whom I came to know through the Francis's,
                    suggested to me that maybe I'd like to come to Delhi as China-affairs officer,
                    to take Jake's place. I quietly told Bob Francis, “I don't want to create
                    problems for you or for myself, but put the scotch on the idea. Bowles likes
                    people who do just what they're told, and I'm having enough trouble with
                    McConaughy. Bowles is bigger than McConaughy, in a way. I don't want to come
                    here. I'll just stay where I am.”</p>
                <p>Anyway, while in Delhi, I'd talk about what was wrong in Pakistan, and the fact
                    that Bhutto and the Chinese were getting closer. Delhi was getting intelligence
                    about the situation in Pakistan. Aside from the intelligence, I was picking this
                    up on my own. The intelligence reports coming in from the intelligence agencies
                    were full of it. But it was all being pooh-poohed by Sneider and the ambassador.
                    This stuff, that was in raw intelligence form, would come in but you couldn't
                    write about it because they didn't want to give it any significance. At times,
                    it appeared that the Department was playing the same game. This was crap.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>In the meantime, I started taking pictures or having pictures taken for me of
                    Chinese tanks coming in the back door in Karachi. Tanks and arms. I tried to get
                    this out, but the ambassador wouldn't let me do anything with it. My cables,
                    were changed and I'd just say, “Take my name off. I don't want my name on this
                    stuff. A war is coming here, and it's being whipped up by the Chinese. Bhutto is
                    involved with it.” When you're in that situation and nobody wants to send
                    anything to Washington, you've got to be very careful about how you handle
                    anything you learn, because they're liable to just try to screw it up.</p>
                <p>It was at this point, after Bhutto had been to Africa and made a lot of
                    statements that had created real problems for the United States, that the stuff
                    hit the fan. Bhutto claimed that we were creating problems in Africa; he was
                    helping the Chinese in their efforts at subversion there.</p>
                <p>The Sindh Club was across the street from the embassy in Karachi. It was the club
                    for the local gentry. Kreisberg, myself and a fellow named Dick Nyrop... (Nyrop
                    was a gusty guy; I'll tell you a story about Nyrop and his courage.) The three
                    of us were at the club when, in front of a bunch of Pakistani foreign ministry
                    types, we called Bhutto some names. I forget what they were, but they weren't
                    very pleasant names, and he's the foreign minister. Because of his lies and crap
                    about the United States, none of us were very happy, and we were saying so.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, a memo arrives at the embassy from the foreign ministry, declaring all
                    three of us persona non grata and wanting us out of there in two weeks.</p>
                <p>I remember McConaughy calling us all in; all three of us in a row like a bunch of
                    lieutenants, as if saluting him, standing at attention in front of his desk. He
                    read this letter to us and said, “Gentlemen, is there any truth to this?”</p>
                <p>And we all piped up, “No, sir!”, in unison. But we knew damn well it was
                    true.</p>
                <p>Within less than a week... By then, it was well known that I was Pir Pagaro's
                    American hunting buddy. It was going on Christmas time. There was to be a new
                    National Assembly election. It was a parliamentary system there. Bhutto had been
                    going around bad-mouthing the United States, and yet Pakistan was very dependent
                    on the United States for a lot of aid, its military aid, etc.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, despite the fact we'd received a memo from the foreign ministry
                    declaring me persona non grata, I received a telephone call from a friend of
                    mine who was at Bhutto's estate inviting me, in the name of Mr. Bhutto, to come
                    as soon as I can get there, for a prolonged hunt with the foreign minister on
                    his estate at Larkana.</p>
                <p>I went to see Sneider to tell him that I've received this invitation from Bhutto.
                    I said, “You know, it's very interesting, Dick; I'm being invited to go hunting
                    with the foreign minister at his estate, while at the same time, they've
                    declared me persona non grata.”</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>He looked at me and he said, “You telling me the truth? You're always coming up
                    with these goddamn lies.”</p>
                <p>He'd cussed me out, called me a son of a bitch one time. I told him, “You do that
                    again, and I'll break your jaw.” I could get physical with enough provocation.
                    Sneider just turned me off. Here all this stuff was going in, all this work I
                    was doing, and I wasn't getting any credit with the Department. (In retrospect,
                    I question whether the Department was interested in the truth. I remember, when
                    I reported in after returning from Karachi, how curt Carol Laise was to me when
                    I called on her. It's my opinion now, that the powers that be there had their
                    own agenda and the truth created problems for them.)</p>
                <p>Sneider sent me in to the ambassador, and the ambassador said, “He's never
                    invited me to go hunting. You're damn right, you go. Get there anyway you can,
                    but you get there. I want to know what's going on.”</p>
                <p>Bhutto is the enemy of my good friend Pir Pagaro, so I wanted to check in with
                    the Pir before I did anything. I call the Pir and ask to see him.</p>
                <p>We got together and the Pir said, “I know about that invitation. I've got spies
                    there. Don't worry, you'll not be seeing Bhutto right away. Bhutto's not there;
                    he's off doing something. When you first get there, your host is going to be a
                    man named Hukro. And Hukro is a dangerous person. He looks like a benign old man
                    — white hair, white beard — but he has killed half a dozen men with his own
                    hands. He's a dangerous guy. But his job is to entertain you until the foreign
                    minister gets back. There'll be people in the room that belong to me, that are
                    my people. So don't worry. Just go and have a good time. You'll learn something
                    about what that place is like.”</p>
                <p>I called the airport (it's the Christmas season maybe mid-December) to charter a
                    private plane. Everybody there at the airport was drunk. You could tell they
                    were having a party. I couldn't get a private plane; the train was always
                    booked, but, with enough bribe money, I bought my way onto the sleeper. I
                    arrived at Larkana. The man who'd called me was there, a lieutenant in the Pak
                    Air Force. The first day we went out hunting, I was worried. Frankly, I was
                    scared. I was scared because here was this guy Bhutto (all the stories I'd heard
                    about him) and then this guy Hukro. Bhutto wasn't there, but his wife was there.
                    I was staying in the residence, in Bhutto's own home, in a guest bedroom.
                    Pictures of Zhou En-lai and Mao Zedong were on the grand piano and thick Chinese
                    carpets on the floor. Mrs. was very nice, as was their daughter who's now the
                    prime minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Benazir.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>THOMAS: Benazir was then a little girl.</p>
                <p>I'd hunted all over the Sindh, south of there. But this was up closer to Lahore,
                    northern Sindh. We were hunting partridge that day, along with pigeons. I never
                    shot pigeons, because I would never shoot anything I wouldn't eat. I didn't like
                    squab, so I didn't shoot pigeons. But, I was shooting more cobras than I was
                    shooting anything else. Blowing their heads off. They'd come up here, and they'd
                    come up there, and boom, boom. Well, this was worrisome; how did so many cobras
                    end up out here? It had never happened before. We shot some partridge that day,
                    and I think I shot a few ring-necked pheasants. It was to be the first day of
                    the hunt. We went back and rested that evening; the next day was a better
                    day.</p>
                <p>The evening of the second day there was to be a party in our honor, which Hukro
                    was to throw at one of the local restaurants. We were back from the hunt about
                    four in the afternoon; my young host, who was about my age, was there, this
                    lieutenant in the Pakistani air corps, a pilot. He said, “Look, these bastards
                    are out to get you drunk tonight. You've got to watch. I've got a pound of
                    butter here, and you and I are going to split the pound, and we're going to eat
                    it with this loaf of bread. You grease everything.” So that's what we did.</p>
                <p>We went to the party; it was a girlie party with Sindhi dancing girls. There was
                    a game they played while the girls danced. Your host or another guest standing
                    behind you would hold money on your cheeks, and the girls would come by and
                    dance in front of you, in low-cut dresses, and lean over you, and take the money
                    away. It was belly-dancing, pretty sensuous. I called them the barefoot, dirty
                    finger-nailed, pretty healthy looking “Sindhi Sexpots”. They were prostitutes.
                    ... and we'd all been drinking pretty heavily, with toasts and all this stuff.
                    Going on the end of the evening, I looked down on my cheeks, and here's a lot of
                    money on both cheeks. Somebody standing behind me with a nice chunk of money,
                    Pak money. The most beautiful, gorgeous, voluptuous of these dancing girls was
                    there in front of me, dancing. Instead of just taking the money, she had these
                    two long ruby painted fingernails on each forefinger; as she took the money, she
                    stabbed me in both cheeks with those fingernails. I had a big gash in both of my
                    cheeks, like saber cuts; I bled like a stuck pig. My host made the comment, “I
                    don't know about your country, Mr. Thomas, but when a woman does that in our
                    country, there is only one cure.” In other words, take her home to bed. I wasn't
                    about to take that girl home to bed. I could see myself coming down with God
                    knows what... So that didn't work, but...</p>
                <p>Christmas was coming on, and I wanted to be with my family. I could see Bhutto
                    wanted me there for two weeks, which would have been right through Christmas.
                    Hunting wasn't that important to me, and I'd done what the ambassador told me,
                    which was to go up there and find out what they were up to.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>Talking to enough people up there, and listening to the drunken talk that was
                    going on around me that night (although I wasn't sober, I was not as drunk as
                    some of the other people I was listening to), I came to the conclusion that the
                    foreign minister wanted to take me around personally, hunting, throughout the
                    whole election district he was campaigning in, to show me off as his American
                    connection, so that he had no worry about people thinking that the Americans
                    were so anti-him because he'd made all these anti-American statements to get
                    himself in with the Chinese. That was what he was using me for; that was the
                    reason.I suddenly announced that I had to leave because I had to get back to my
                    family for the Christmas holidays. I thanked them for their... They got me a
                    reservation back to Karachi.</p>
                <p>On arrival at Karachi, it must have been six in the morning, the ambassador's car
                    was waiting for me at the train station, with orders to take me directly to the
                    residence. The ambassador was shaving when I arrived. The ambassador turned
                    around and looked at me with these scars on my face; he said, “What the hell
                    happened to you?” I told him the story of the dancing girl.</p>
                <p>Then he asked, “What did your wife say?”</p>
                <p>I said, “I haven't seen her yet.”</p>
                <p>He said, “I want to know what she says.”</p>
                <p>Anyway, I told him what I thought this was all about with Bhutto. That evening on
                    arriving at a reception with my wife the ambassador spotted me coming in the
                    door and signaled for me to join him. His first question was “What did your wife
                    say?” “She said 'Are your Tetanus shots up to date?'” He roared, and noted that
                    my wife was a pretty cool lady.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, Pir Pagaro had someone in the foreign ministry who knew what was
                    going on, and the Pir was passing that information to me. The Pir even offered
                    to let me talk to this source, but I said I didn't want to. This person had seen
                    a memo that discussed a letter of agreement between Pakistan and China, a secret
                    letter of agreement that had to do with preparations for this war against India,
                    in which China agreed to do certain things, and the Paks were working with the
                    Chinese in terms of this.</p>
                <p>I put this in a memo to the ambassador, that I'd heard this through one of my
                    sources, but I couldn't tell him exactly where it came from except out of the
                    foreign ministry.</p>
                <p>I sent this, of course, through Sneider; Sneider was livid. That was the morning
                    I threatened to knock his block off when he called me a son of a bitch because
                    of this information. “You haven't got any proof. All you've got there are words
                    in a memo , You sob!” Etc., etc.</p>
                <p>“I've shown you pictures of tanks coming in here. I've shown you this; I've shown
                    you that.”</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>In the meantime, Jimmy Fancy came to me with the same facts, that there was a war
                    coming; that China and Pakistan were planning to provoke it with India.</p>
                <p>My tour was about over, coming close to an end. Fancy said to me, “Your leaving
                    just at this time, it's terrible. You're the Chinese-affairs officer.”</p>
                <p>What happened concerned my daughter. The Department wanted me to stay longer. My
                    daughter had been bitten by something; she started having convulsions.</p>
                <p>The administrative officer there was of Filipino background, an ex-chief petty
                    officer out of the Navy. He was typical of those who kiss ass above but would
                    screw the secretaries and everybody that was junior. For example, he'd pay the
                    officers' per diem to go up Islamabad on TDY. The embassy was getting ready to
                    move, we were building a new embassy up north. Because of this, the staff had to
                    go up there at times. The secretaries had to go there, but they weren't given
                    per diem, yet the officers were. The secretaries needed it more than the
                    officers.</p>
                <p>The embassy doctor recommended that my daughter be taken to Frankfurt to be
                    checked out in the hospital there because the local hospital was terrible...</p>
                <p>But the son of a bitch refused to sign the orders.</p>
                <p>When I heard this, I went in on a Saturday afternoon. He was in his office. He
                    didn't know how to use the staff; he was always at his own typewriter, doing
                    things. I said, “If you don't sign those orders, I'll spend the rest of my
                    career getting your career.” It was my daughter whose health was at stake in
                    this situation.</p>
                <p>He was livid. People usually didn't speak to him that way, because the
                    administrative officer could create problems for you.</p>
                <p>Well, he signed the orders, and my wife and daughter went off to Germany. But
                    they still didn't cure her, and these convulsions would come and go. They had
                    her on sedatives, some purple-colored stuff that would dope her out.</p>
                <p>I wanted to get the hell out of there. My two years were up. The situation was
                    dangerous, the embassy was blind, deaf and dumb, the family was too important to
                    risk under such conditions . Even though the Department wanted me to stay on, I
                    wasn't about to. There's a war coming, and nobody wanted to believe me.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>Now here's the damnedest thing about this, in terms of the realities of what was
                    happening in that embassy. Jimmy Fancy said, “Look, you're leaving within days
                    on a ship.” I was taking the Lloyd Trestino Lines out of Karachi. He said, “I
                    want to throw a luncheon in your honor, I want you to bring several officers
                    from your embassy to that luncheon, so I can get to know some of them. In order
                    to keep your ambassador informed, somebody's got to take your place as my
                    contact with the embassy. If we have a war with India, this could be terrible
                    for everybody here, and ruin my business.” He had a big industrial complex.</p>
                <p>I said, “All right. Sure.”</p>
                <p>There were some CIA people in the building; there were the other political
                    officers. I invited several from each group to go to that luncheon. Not one of
                    those people wanted to go. I ended up at that luncheon alone. Not one of them
                    would leave the embassy. They all used the excuse that they didn't want to be
                    out of there. They wanted to be there because the ambassador might need them.
                    Christ, they weren't learning anything sitting in that embassy. The whole issue
                    was: they knew where their bread was buttered. Being involved with the truth
                    could be dangerous for one's career.</p>
                <p>Now, a flashback, this one concerns a rather gusty guy named Nyrop... After I
                    first arrived in Karachi, everyone was complaining about the commissary. The
                    prices in the commissary were horrendous. Everybody in USAID (we had a big USAID
                    mission there), clerks in the embassy , officers and wives complained about the
                    terrible prices in the commissary.</p>
                <p>Motor pool cars took us to the office in the morning and home at night. You never
                    knew who was going to be in your car. It would be the head of the USIA one
                    minute and a clerk the next time. I had a personal car, but most of the time, I
                    left it home with my wife and rode in an embassy car, because she needed
                    transportation for the kids to go to school.</p>
                <p>I was in the car with the head of USIS, the deputy chief of the political
                    section, and someone else, I think somebody from the CIA, and they were all
                    complaining about prices in the commissary. I was brand new and listened but I
                    decided to find out why the prices were so high.</p>
                <p>I started making contacts within the American official community and asking
                    questions. I soon located somebody in USAID who knew something. He said “If I
                    give you a memo that I've gotten my hands on, that I'm not supposed to have,
                    will you not let anybody know where you got it?”</p>
                <p>I said, “You're damn right. Nobody'll know. I'll just say I got this memo.”</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>This memo had been written for the ambassador by the administrative counselor
                    concerning the commissary problem, the reason why prices had to be so high, and
                    the fact that this was causing economic hardship for the whole staff. This had
                    to be kept quiet because it was necessary to cover up the mistake made by the
                    previous ambassador.</p>
                <p>This memo pointed out that the previous ambassador to McConaughy, [William
                    Manning Rountree]... a career type, who was, I gather, somewhat arrogant, had
                    given away to the Pak Government the big warehouse and building which housed the
                    commissary. The money to build these buildings on land owned by the United
                    States government was the capital of the embassy community and not U.S.
                    Government money. Without it the community had no real property against which it
                    could borrow at reasonable rates for ordinary operating expenses. This capital
                    represented the three or four or five hundred dollars each family put up on
                    arrival, and you got it back when you left. It turned out that this ambassador
                    had given away that building to the Pak government. So the capital for the
                    embassy club was no longer there to borrow against. Therefore, we had to borrow
                    at high interest rates. At the same time, the manager was buying all his stuff
                    from one outfit in Texas, single source. There was some corruption, obviously,
                    over that. But nobody wanted to talk about that aspect, because that's part of
                    the... It appears the administrative officers were tied in with that some way,
                    but I couldn't prove that. But I did have a copy of this memo, with all the
                    details.</p>
                <p>I thermofaxed copies of this memo, enough for every officer attending the weekly
                    staff meeting. All embassy officers were present. Before the meeting, I put one
                    a copy at every place around the table and on every chair in the room.</p>
                <p>The administrative counselor arrived saw the document; jumped up and said, “ Who
                    put this out?”</p>
                <p>I raised my hand. He was livid. By then, a lot of people had read it. I said,
                    “Obviously, something's got to be done about this commissary. It appears to be
                    the fault of the administration.”</p>
                <p>The only person in that room who stuck with me in that fight (and a fight went on
                    that morning) was this one junior political officer named Dick Nyrop. He stuck
                    with me. Everybody else, including the senior officers and heads of other
                    agencies all backed down.</p>
                <p>From then on, they, at least, knew what had happened. I said, “From now on,
                    gentlemen, I will manage to get my stuff my own way.”</p>
                <p>The commissary was trying to make most of profits on the liquor sales. We were
                    paying a horrible price for liquor, compared to other embassies. I asked a
                    British colleague to put in an order for me. I bought all of my liquor from the
                    British from then on, just to get around that problem. By the case. You had to
                    buy it that way rather than by the bottle.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>This problem involving commissaries is endemic to the system. By the end of my
                    career I had seen enough to come to that conclusion, but this occasion was the
                    first lesson to me. As I remember it, the man running the commissary in Karachi
                    had been in Afghanistan where he had been fired from that commissary. It was
                    always these single source operations in which prices were too high. I felt
                    there was some kickback going on in the system. I think it was bigger than one
                    person. That's my feeling. Back in the Department, there was something wrong
                    with that whole structure. But, without a full scale investigation by the I.G.,
                    who could say for sure?</p>
                <p>Anyway, out of this, I was not popular with the administrative counselor,
                    especially after I raised all this hell about sending my daughter out of country
                    for treatment.</p>
                <p>In the end, nobody came to the Fancy party, they knew what the ambassador didn't
                    want to hear.</p>
                <p>My last night there was a Friday night. We were boarding the ship on Saturday
                    morning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: In the fall, early September? of 1965. The war is imminent. The embassy
                    is pretending it's not happening. I had pictures, and had shown them to the
                    political chief, of tanks being brought in. The intelligence people are talking
                    about it, but you couldn't get the embassy...</p>
                <p>McConaughy felt (according to feedback within the embassy) that if he admitted
                    that Pakistan our ally, a member of both CENTO and SEATO, was in bed with
                    Communist China, he could not compete with Bowles in Delhi. He didn't want this.
                    He was keeping Pakistan in our court. Pakistan was in our court, and that was
                    that. They weren't in with the Chinese Communists. That was the gospel. He was
                    in a state of denial and self delusion.</p>
                <p>It was very obvious that it wasn't going off that way.</p>
                <p>The night before we were to leave, there were a lot of parties in our honor
                    around the community. I'd gotten to know the Brits and the French and everybody.
                    We had this China Club the members of which were for the most part the
                    ambassadors or DCM's who had become personal friends.</p>
                <p>Before we went to the parties, I got a call from Pir Pagaro. He said, “Look, you
                    plan to come here last thing, after all your parties are over. Plan to stay all
                    night, because I've got something I want to give you as a going-away present.
                    I'd like to help your career.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Okay.”</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>Well, it turned out the Pir had been called in two days earlier by the general
                    staff of the Pak army and asked to sit in on the general staff meetings of the
                    planning for the war. The Pir didn't approve of this war. But they wanted to use
                    his bandit people, the Hurs, who also lived part of the time in
                    India...nomadic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was going to be the Sindh War, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: The Sindh War, yes. It went off up in Karachi and in Kashmir and in the
                    Sindh and across in to the Punjab.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was sort of called the Sindh War.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: The Sindh War, '65. Anyway, it was close to Lahore, where the... and then
                    in the Sindh. Well, the whole thing was planned, and they wanted the Pir to use
                    his people as guerilla fighters. He was given the whole battle plan, when things
                    were to start, the order of battle i.e. where the troops were, etc. for him to
                    study and have for his use, so that he understood.</p>
                <p>He said, “Here, now you copy this down. I can't let you have this, but you copy
                    all this you want to.”</p>
                <p>I copied. I spent all night copying this damn thing, making drawings, quick
                    drawings, putting troops where they were, and the whole damned battle plan.</p>
                <p>I hadn't had any sleep. At six in the morning, I put the plan into my safe in the
                    political section. It's a Saturday morning. I wrote a big sign telling the
                    reader to get the security officer and have him open it and read the document
                    inside. It was very important. Right on the safe, big sign.</p>
                <p>After I got back to the Department, I learned that stuff never was sent to
                    Washington. The whole battle plan we had ahead of time never got out of that
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>Along with this information that I had learned from the Pir and some of his
                    connections, I also learned that this was not just to be a war in Pakistan, this
                    was to be the start of a move to force America out of the Far East.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>In other words, if this effort had been successful, it was only the first part of
                    a total plan whereby there was to be a coup in Indonesia, which was to overthrow
                    the right wing. You had a right wing and a left wing in Indonesia. But the left
                    wing, the Communists, were to overthrow the right wing and move on Malaysia and
                    move also on Vietnam, because we were having problems in Vietnam. This was '65.
                    At the same time, they were going to get the North Koreans to move into South
                    Korea. This was to be the first move in a broad scale effort all over Asia to
                    force the Americans out of Asia. You know, the domino thing. All of this was
                    being planned in Beijing.</p>
                <p>This was not something that my ambassador wanted to hear anything about.</p>
                <p>We boarded the ship. As it turned out, due to our socializing there, we'd gotten
                    to know, but not realized it, the agent for Lloyd Tristino. He'd been to our
                    home many times, and I never even thought of him. So when we decided to go by
                    ship, I asked the travel section in the embassy to get me my reservations.
                    Suddenly, I received a call from this guy, and he said, “You know, I'm their
                    agent here.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Oh, I'd forgotten that.”</p>
                <p>He said, “You know your government's rules. You're going on that ship, but you're
                    not going to have confirmation until the last minute, because you're going to
                    have the best cabin on the ship.”</p>
                <p>It ended up, we did. It was right at the center of the ship, so the rest of the
                    ship rolls around that position.</p>
                <p>The voyage began in Yokohama and went all the way through to Venice; Karachi was
                    the halfway point. The Captain's Ball was the night after we left Karachi. For
                    my wife and me, this was our first social event aboard, all dressed up in tuxedo
                    and fancy gown.</p>
                <p>At the Captain's Ball, they gave away the captain's prize of a jeroboam of
                    champagne to the winner of the elimination dance. The elimination dance was done
                    using a bingo machine, if the number pasted to your lapel came up, you sat down.
                    We were out there dancing, with a number on my lapel, suddenly one of the
                    stewards came up and changed my number. I didn't even think anything about it.
                    We're dancing along, and the numbers keep falling, and we keep dancing and we
                    keep dancing and we keep dancing. At the end, we're the only ones left standing.
                    So they deliver the jeroboam of champagne.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>Most of the dance music being played all evening long was typical rock and roll
                    music of the ''60s. Well, I had been dancing with this Italian crowd in Karachi,
                    including this guy (he was an Italian) who was representing Lloyd Tristino at
                    the local hotels. I would dance with the wives, and they all liked Viennese
                    waltzing. I can waltz and many men don't. I learned this as a young man at
                    military school. Many people there knew I could waltz, and my wife and I waltzed
                    often in the ball rooms of the local hotels. They then announced, “Would the
                    winner of the jeroboam of champagne lead off the next dance?” And guess what
                    they played the minute we got up? A waltz, the first that evening. Of course,
                    that tipped us that this was all set up. It was a setup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, why don't we stop at this point. You left in '65,
                        and you were coming back to the Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is the 17th of April, 1995. This is also income tax day, because it's a
                    Monday. Fred, we've got you leaving Pakistan in 1965. Then whiter?</p>
                <p>[THOMAS: In retrospect, to this point in my career, I had served in two posts as
                    a political officer, Korea and Pakistan. In both, one faced the same problem, a
                    lack of integrity by those in positions of power to attempt to report honestly
                    because it either would not be welcome in Washington or it would, in the eyes of
                    our ambassador, reflect badly on his tenure. It appears that the development of
                    a rational effective foreign policy, based on the realities of a situation, has
                    become the hostage of dogmatically conceived views which have been concocted to
                    serve the narrow economic interests of the “Establishment”.]</p>
                <p>THOMAS: I returned to the department, and was told that I would be given a
                    posting someplace in the Far East where, after all that work in language school,
                    I could use my Chinese. Every time they went to send me someplace, there was
                    somebody willing to quietly shoot it down. But, as you can imagine, from what I
                    have said so far, I was not the most political guy in the world when it came to
                    bucking the bureaucracy. I realized that, but I had a philosophy that I had to
                    live with, that I was brought up with, and it made it impossible for me to play
                    the smart bureaucratic game. Therefore you do step on some toes when you call a
                    spade a spade. And every time they kept turning... And so I sat in limbo for
                    about a year here, in sort of never-never land, just going into the office. It
                    was like after all of us who left Vietnam, later. But in this case, it wasn't
                    because there weren't enough jobs, it was that the jobs they had in mind kept
                    falling through.</p>
                <p>At last, I said, “Look, if this is going to continue, I've got kids and a wife,
                    and I can't stay in limbo any longer. Let's give me a job.”</p>
                <p>There was an outfit known as the Office of Strategic Research, in the Department,
                    and it had a function. There was a man whom I'd known. I'm trying to think of
                    his name now. You know, names, after this many years... James, Jim.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>As a flashback, he had been chief of the political section while I had been a
                    student in Taiwan. And I had been told that I was going to be pulled out of
                    language school there and sent to him to do what they call the
                    political/military job, because they had to rewrite the Status of Forces
                    Agreement there. I put up a hell of a fight, saying I hadn't come to this
                    language school to have it interrupted, and I didn't want to do that, and if
                    they insisted I come there right away, I'd just resign from the whole shebang.
                    And so, when I said that, I remember the ambassador, Drumright, called me in. He
                    had heard what I'd had to say, and he said, “All right, I'll give you three more
                    months down there. In three months, you're to be up here,” from the language
                    school into that job. Well, by the time the three months were up, thank God
                    they'd found somebody else to fill it, and I didn't have to go.</p>
                <p>Anyway, he was back here and he was chief of the political section there, and we
                    got to know each other, and I liked him; he liked me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chief of the political section in this Office of Strategic
                        Research?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: No, he was in the Office of Strategic Research, one of the senior people
                    in it by then. He said, “Fred, you've got an engineering degree, and we need
                    somebody with an electrical engineering degree.” At this time, they were
                    spending gobs of money on the McNamara Line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. You might explain what the McNamara Line
                        was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: They were designing electronics and all type devices to decide whether
                    the Communists were coming down the Ho Chi Minh Trail and what was coming down
                    the Ho Chi Minh Trail. It was massive amounts of money. I was shocked when I got
                    into this.</p>
                <p>They needed somebody who could understand the jargon of engineering, and somebody
                    who had some imagination, who could take and look at a thing and determine its
                    significance to the State Department and to the policy makers.</p>
                <p>Out of this office, they had to have a couple of people who ran around doing
                    liaison with the national security agencies — Defense; State; CIA; NSA; the
                    Energy Department; anything that had to do with highly classified projects. But
                    the biggest one was DARPA, which was the Defense Advanced Research Project
                    Agency of the Defense Department. They were spending the most money. You had
                    naval research doing some. You had the DS&amp;T in the CIA, the Division for
                    Science and Technology or something. And then you had people out at NSA who were
                    working on projects. But, fundamentally, most of the time was spent with DARPA,
                    running around looking at all the latest things going on.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>I received more clearances than you can shake a stick at. I don't want to go into
                    them all, but there were more clearances than most people ever need, mostly
                    scientific-type clearances. I soon realized there were many levels of SI
                    clearances, and I received many levels of them. I'd had the normal levels,
                    but...</p>
                <p>Anyway, off I go to look at all this stuff, trying to define it and what it
                    meant. It was very interesting, but it wasn't a good career job for a State
                    officer. You had a lot of clearances, and you saw a lot of things, and it was
                    sort of fun. It was like being dumped as a Class I into being an aide or POLAD
                    to one of the generals or admirals in the DOD. It's nice and it's pleasant, but
                    you're not going any place out of that type job.</p>
                <p>I can go into some things, but some things I'm sure are still classified. But I
                    do know that I was not there to come up with ideas. With a thinking mind and an
                    engineering degree, listening to people and watching what was going on, the
                    first thing I noted, coming out of a military family, was this concept of
                    engineers designing things that were completely over-engineered that it
                    considered nothing but technology not only to design it, build it, and use it,
                    but to put it in place. So this meant that whatever they wanted to plant had to
                    be able to take nine Gs. They dropped it to the ground from up in the air, on
                    bombing runs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were basically like sending sensors down with a spike
                        at the bottom.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Yes, that's right. I said, “This is crazy. First of all, these are
                    seismic, or they're magnetic, or they're this, or they're that. But the average
                    commander in the field is not going to believe beeps coming in. You know, a beep
                    that's louder or a beep that's smaller, does it mean a truck? Does it mean a
                    tank? This just doesn't go over.” I said, “You've got to come up with something
                    that shows him what's happening.”</p>
                <p>Out of this came a concept for which I was the idea man, the pusher and locator
                    of money for the project. It was to look at things and send a visual image to a
                    command center.</p>
                <p>First of all, they starting looking at things with television cameras. Television
                    cameras eat up a lot of power, especially the old-fashioned vidicom tubes. There
                    was no way that you were going to put anything out in the jungle that could look
                    at a jungle trail, where you had all that data that you had to send back, and do
                    it with batteries using a vidicom tube. It was just impossible, powerwise.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>I then started asking about solid-state sensors, which are light sensitive, that
                    will tell what's going by them. The idea I came up with was the idea of what you
                    call a solid-state line array of sensors with a set of several sensors to the
                    right and left which were to act as switches to turn on and off the full array.
                    It was vertical in configuration, with a lens in front of it, looking out at a
                    scene. It had a sweep circuit on it that swept the vertical line of sensors.(The
                    flanking switch sensors turned on the sweep circuit and the full array.)
                    Solid-state sensors don't take a lot of power. They're not like a vidicom tube.
                    With a focusing lens in the front of them, they can be focused on. These trip
                    sensors or switches said, turn on. The whole device is not truly on; just the
                    switches or trip sensors that are monitoring the field of view. The trip sensor
                    would then turn on a sweep circuit on the real sensor the minute it felt motion
                    in front of it. Motion in front of it going this way, there was sweeping going
                    this way, you'd create the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of your hands is going vertically, and the other is
                        going horizontally.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: The horizontal is the vehicle moving, and the vertical is the sensor
                    cutting that vehicle up. Because the vehicle is moving at such a slow speed,
                    even going 60 miles an hour, if it were, but on jungle trails it was going 20,
                    slow speed compared to electrical speed, it takes a very what they call
                    narrow-band width in electronics to send that data. And a narrow-band width
                    doesn't take much power to send out.</p>
                <p>Do you follow this?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Well, because it doesn't take much power, it could be brought into a very
                    low-level signal device that could send out that signal, and even encode it, and
                    you could pick it up at a fair distance and keep relaying it. When it hit what
                    they call a holding oscilloscope, the holding oscilloscope would take that and,
                    with the sweep-circuit notches that go on each end of this, could tell that
                    circuit to take each one of these and stack them, one against another, on the
                    tube. And when it does that, suddenly you end up with a picture of what went by
                    there. Okay? But it can be done with very low light levels. and with very low
                    demands on power.</p>
                <p>But this, therefore, meant you needed a combination of things. You couldn't just
                    drop it into the ground. You needed people to deliver it and put it in
                    place.</p>
                <p>The CIA, at that time, was running all these little brown people, called the
                    Montagnards, as trail watchers, trying to just mark down notches on a piece of
                    paper as they saw something go by and come back. Well, that had its limitations,
                    because nobody wanted to believe these guys.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>But if you could put something like that in a tree, overlooking a trail, with a
                    transmitter in it, which was properly packaged to withstand the weather, you
                    could look at that trail and, in real time, see what was going down it, off at
                    some command post someplace.</p>
                <p>This was my contribution to the concept. But it was pretty late in the game by
                    then. It was about 1968 when I came up with this idea; by then, the elections
                    were...</p>

                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Satellites and all that.</p>
                <p>But that was my one contribution to this job, except finding it fascinating to
                    run around to all these labs. I went to the Bell Labs, I went to Xerox. I saw
                    everything in this country.</p>
                <p>But then it made for real problems for me later, because when that job finished
                    up, they decided that I needed to be civilized. I'd been in East Asia too long,
                    and they were going to give me a nice tour in Europe.</p>
                <p>It started out with a concept of sending me to Switzerland. I started doing some
                    studies on Switzerland, and I saw at that time some data coming out of a Swiss
                    magazine that had been published at the Osaka Trade Fair that pointed out that,
                    in the previous year, 65 percent of all funds invested in all U.S. markets (not
                    just stock markets; in all markets) had come through Swiss accounts. And this
                    struck me as having long-term, very dangerous financial implications for the
                    health of the world economy. Too much money going into too few hands, because it
                    would be untaxed.</p>
                <p>Looking into the reasons why, I wrote a paper pointing out the history of the
                    issue - President Johnson in the mid '60s became very upset about American
                    investment money moving abroad. Back when he first took over as president, he
                    laid down some laws, or got some things put through to limit that investment, in
                    terms of American dollars. It was that action that really created the
                    Euro-dollar market. That's what started it all. The big money in the world was
                    not being taxed while moving through Europe. I outlined what I saw of the
                    history and how this thing developed, and suggested what was probably going to
                    happen in time if this continued. We truly needed to look at what was happening
                    in Switzerland more deeply.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>My paper, caused questioning by the economics people. I guess this wasn't the
                    thing to be saying, because suddenly my job was switched from Switzerland; I was
                    to go to the political section in Bonn as what they called the Asian guy,
                    working for Jock Dean.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's John Gunther Dean.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Yes. He had a brother, David, who was a Chinese linguist. I was going to
                    go to work in his political section. I heard some real horror stories about how
                    he was a real martinet to work for. I wasn't too happy about this, but that's
                    the way life is.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, the Magnuson Bill blew up in everybody's face. This was a bill in which
                    they wanted to take the commercial work away from the State Department and give
                    it to the Department of Commerce. I'd been a political officer until then, and
                    suddenly there was something put through in the Department that took 100
                    political slots worldwide and made them commercial officers, in order to save
                    the commercial work for the Department of State. It turned out that the job I
                    was to go to ended up being one of them. I ended up, at the last minute, being
                    assigned to Bonn as a commercial officer, to try to increase American exports,
                    etc., to Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always like to get the dates. You were in Bonn from when
                        to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: From 1970 to 1972. So I took a German-language course and was shipped off
                    to Bonn. But, before I could go, I sat in a hotel, because they kept canceling.
                    Every time I was to go, they'd cancel. We sat in a hotel I don't know how many
                    weeks, because I had all these clearances, and nobody would let me go on any
                    plane. In the end, I'm sure the plane they put me on was one of these... You
                    know, there was all this kidnaping or hijacking of planes at that time. My
                    orders were to get off the plane in Frankfurt and take the train north. I think
                    they had sky marshals on that specific flight. So we went to Frankfurt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're speaking of an era when there were a lot of
                        hijacking, and there was concern about anybody with clearances or who had
                        access to information that might end up in the hands of one of these
                        terrorist groups.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: They had their connections with the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They might have had their connection with somebody.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I was told I couldn't go into Eastern Europe; I couldn't go into East
                    Berlin. I could go to Berlin, but I had to go on the train. There were certain
                    rules I had to live by.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>The commercial people in Bonn were great to me. I didn't know what the hell I was
                    doing; it was a new thing for me. I looked at it like a political officer looks
                    at things, I wasn't looking at it in the normal commercial officer's way. They
                    were used to putting on trade shows and filling out all these forms. All that
                    bored the hell out of me, so I started trying to figure out new ways to get the
                    German government to help with our balance-of-payments problems.</p>
                <p>I remember going around trying to sell the Bundesbahn on buying American toilet
                    paper. They called me the toilet paper man. Then and probably now its
                    “sandpaper” in the “roll” of toilet paper on the German trains. It became my
                    mission to sell American toilet paper in order to service the bottoms of the
                    burghers who rode the Bundesbahn. What an ambition!</p>
                <p>Anyway, I set up a series of conferences between the American PX system there,
                    buyers, and the big German department stores.</p>
                <p>The bureaucratic politics, which is important in such situations, involved the
                    counselor of embassy for commercial affairs, who was a temporary appointee from
                    the Department of Commerce. Then there was the commercial attach� and an
                    assistant commercial attach�, who were both State officers; both owed their
                    careers to the Department of Commerce and had been looked after by them. I was a
                    commercial officer, but I had no connection with the Department of Commerce.
                    Heading the whole economic-commercial section was the minister for economic and
                    commercial affairs, Chuck Wootton, a State officer. He looked on me as being the
                    person to look after State's interests in this situation, as compared to these
                    other fellows. Therefore, he was more than happy to give me support for my
                    rather unorthodox ideas. Because of my previous job, I was interested in
                    high-technology sales opportunities. But Pollack, who was the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Herman Pollack.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: He ran the science attach� department in the Department. He wanted
                    nothing to do with commercial things. He wanted his science attach�s to be
                    strictly academic, doctorates, you know. The science attach� in Bonn had his
                    doctorate. We hit it off, we were both hunters. He said “Come along. I'm not
                    allowed to be commercial; you can be the commercial side of the science office.”
                    So, I joined the science attach� club and got to know a good many people that
                    way. At the same time I was trying to drum up new business.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>My big break came. The economic minister assigned me to fill in for him when he
                    did not have the time to represent the Ambassador at various functions. This was
                    due to the fact that the commercial counselor was an introvert, a nice,
                    intelligent man, but very introverted. He couldn't go out and make a speech, so
                    they had me going out and making speeches at these openings of American plants.
                    The ambassador would be invited, but he didn't have the time; the job went to
                    the minister; if he couldn't go, I ended up doing it. Out of this, I got the
                    impression that we were building a hell of a lot of fully owned American plants
                    there in Germany. At about the same time, Mansfield, back here in the Senate,
                    was raising all type hell about pulling American troops out of Europe. This was
                    worrying the hell out of the Germans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a Mansfield amendment that went on and on all
                        the time. Michael Mansfield, the senator from Montana.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Yes, that's right. One evening, there was a dinner party; at that party
                    was a senior official from the finance ministry. I was seated next to him at the
                    dinner table. I started talking about the fact that they were allowing the
                    Americans to build all these plants there, obviously hopeful that this would
                    create some political pressure to protect their investment. I said, “Really,
                    that doesn't do it. You'd be much better off to have your German companies going
                    to the right districts in the United States, where there were senators who sat
                    on the appropriate committees, and having factories in those districts exporting
                    things to Germany; let's say, car parts that were used in automobiles that were
                    made here, under license. You'd get much more political leverage that way.”</p>
                <p>This guy listened to me, and a few days later, I received a call from him; could
                    he bring some people over to call on me at the embassy, from the ministry. They
                    came and we discussed the idea in depth.</p>
                <p>I went to see my State boss, the minister, and explained what I'd said and what
                    had happened. He got all excited, he offered to sponsor a conference in his
                    office for the next meeting. The Germans had said they were going to call me
                    again.</p>
                <p>The next call came from a couple of them wanting to come with some people from
                    Volkswagen. It seems that the German government owns a chunk of Volkswagen
                    stock. The Volkswagen people, after listening to us, said, “We don't want to do
                    this directly, but we export a lot of cars to the United States. Because we buy
                    a lot of parts from Bosch, we're going to ask Bosch to look into having some
                    parts, which we use in our Volkswagens, made in the States.”</p>
                <p>Bosch came around. Then I sent off my cable to the Department of Commerce. Boy,
                    was I doing great stuff! The minister, Chuck Wootton, was pleased with it all.
                    It proved State officers could really do commercial work. We were getting
                    something done.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>It all looked very good until about six weeks later, when the people from Bosch
                    returned and came to call. I said, “What's wrong?”</p>
                <p>They said, “We went around to these various companies that make auto parts.
                    Nobody was willing to build stuff to our specifications. They wanted to continue
                    to build this junk they build, that lasts two years and is shot. They refused to
                    go along with our approach to what we wanted built under our name.”</p>
                <p>I said, “If that's the case, then you better plan on putting in your own
                    factory.”</p>
                <p>They said, “We'll consider that.”</p>
                <p>That was the start to Bosch's entry into manufacturing in this country. It had
                    that political basis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Out of this, the minister gave me the job of running a big benefit to
                    make money for the school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the American community school.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Yes. And so I said, If he'd let me run it my way. He said, “You run it
                    any way you want.”</p>
                <p>I knew the big contracts there were let by the U. S. military, and that many of
                    the American business people's children went to our school. I also knew that if
                    this effort was to be successful, I needed them on board. The minister had made
                    me chairman of this American School Benefit Committee. I went and enlisted as
                    co-chairman, a colonel who, with his German born wife, were very socially active
                    among the German community. He was the senior colonel on General Mearns's MAG
                    staff. Mearns and I were good friends. He was a West Pointer, and he knew my
                    family. So I'd gotten to know him well; he'd introduced me to a lot of Germans
                    to go hunting, and gotten me a jagdschein.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jagdschein being a hunting license.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: And very hard to come by.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I enlisted Colonel DeSanto to become the co-chairman. He got some of his
                    junior officers to become the administrative workhorses for this effort. In the
                    end, we made a lot of money. We gave away a car, and we gave away a lot of other
                    things at this banquet. Ford gave us an automobile to give away in a raffle; it
                    was a big moneymaker.</p>
                <p>Out of this, I'd become somewhat popular with the school administration. Chuck
                    Wootton wanted me to re-up and stay on. But I wanted to get back to East Asia
                    and Chinese, because here China had just opened up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nixon had made his visit there in, what was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: In 1971. China had opened up. I'd learned Chinese, and I wanted to get
                    back to East Asia and China. In response to every inquiry, came the answer that
                    all the slots were already filled. You've been away from the China crowd for a
                    while. You'll have to come back and do your stint in Vietnam. Because that's
                    where everybody was going. So I thought, well, that's fine.</p>
                <p>I gave up this pleasant job, drinking wine on the Rhine and going around Germany
                    and having a good time. Relatively, it was the most pleasant post I've ever had.
                    It wasn't high excitement, but it was fun.</p>
                <p>I came back to the States; was put through French-language school and sent off to
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served in Vietnam from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: From '73 to '75. I got there, and I was, first of all...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you get there in '73?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Spring of '73. They not only sent me to learn French, but they also sent
                    me to the consular course here in the Department. I was to be the supervising
                    consul in Saigon. I didn't look forward to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking to the man who was the consul general in
                        Saigon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Is that right?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I was there '69-'70.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Is that right? I was to go there at that time. It was a “rule or law
                    based” job, and I didn't want it. Then suddenly it was changed to my being one
                    of a group of officers to replace those assigned to the ICCS liaison office.
                    They'd had a group in there on TDY, four officers, to handle this function, and
                    the last of them was leaving just as I got there. He was the only one left. I
                    got there and had a week's overlap with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the ICCS is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: The ICCS was set up by the Paris conference in February of that year to
                    oversee the keeping of the peace. It had four member states in it, each headed
                    by an ambassador, with a general officer. Each delegation consisted of about
                    200-250 people. We're talking about 1,000 people in total. It started out with
                    the Canadians and the Indonesians being the Western representatives, and the
                    Hungarians and the Poles being the Communist representatives in this
                    organization. You know, Communist. The guy I was replacing, he wasn't much help
                    to me. He was too busy going to parties in his honor and leaving. I was not to
                    be the boss man. The boss I awaited was a man named Pratt Byrd. I don't know if
                    you know Pratt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Well, Pratt was to be boss; there was also to be a junior officer
                    assigned, total of three people and a secretary. Pratt was leaving his wife in
                    the States. I'd left my wife here. On the way out there, I had heard that there
                    had been one officer in the political section, who was a Chinese linguist, who
                    was leaving just as I was arriving, who had been allowed to keep his family on
                    Taiwan. But Taiwan was a place where only AID people were generally kept. State
                    people were kept in Bangkok. I wanted to keep mine, for Chinese-language
                    reasons, on Taiwan. If I was going to run back and forth, it'd help my Chinese.
                    My wife spoke Chinese. It'd be just more pleasant. On the way out, I stopped at
                    the embassy there in Taiwan and went to the AID people and tried to talk them
                    into letting me be there. They didn't want to do it. The embassy in Taiwan
                    wasn't much help.</p>
                <p>I arrived in Saigon. We had an acting ambassador at the time. He was leaving, and
                    our new ambassador hadn't arrived yet; everything was in limbo until Martin
                    arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Graham Martin.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>THOMAS: I went to see him about trying to put my family in Taiwan, and ask for
                    his help. He said, “Well, wouldn't you like to bring your family here?”</p>
                <p>No families with school age children had been allowed.</p>
                <p>I said, “Why sure.”</p>
                <p>He said, “If you can get your kids in this local school, I'll let you bring your
                    family.”</p>
                <p>This was a breakthrough.</p>
                <p>I went around to see the Phoenix school people. It was a little school run by the
                    missionaries, and they agreed to let my kids in. The minute I got there, they
                    said, “We can't handle very many, but we'll let your children in.” I got a piece
                    of paper from them saying so.</p>
                <p>Thus the ambassador authorized the Department to cut orders for my wife and
                    children to come to Saigon. I went to Hong Kong to meet them on their way
                    out.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, Pratt Byrd arrived. But he wasn't bringing his wife; she was
                    going to stay in the States. We were just starting to roll.</p>
                <p>First of all, you have to understand that the ICCS office there was not popular.
                    We were given what had been the administrative counselor's office, on the first
                    floor of the embassy because we had to have access to these four delegations.
                    Also, they didn't want them to go where there was anything classified. So the
                    first-floor big office suite for the administrative counselor was turned over to
                    us. Pratt and I shared those quarters. There were four offices: three smaller
                    offices and the big office, which was also a conference room. The secretary had
                    the office between mine and Pratt's, the junior officer had the office behind
                    mine and Pratt had the big one, the conference room.</p>
                <p>We stocked the refrigerator with booze. It was a different type operation than
                    you usually have because the Hungarians and Poles drink in the middle of the
                    day.</p>
                <p>We decided to throw a party. Pratt asked me if I could finance it. At the time, I
                    thought I could, until we got paid off by the embassy. He said, “But if we go
                    ask permission, they're not going to give it to us because you know what they
                    think about us.”</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>First of all, the ambassador didn't like the ICCS; he made it very clear. He
                    didn't like the concept of the ICCS; he didn't like these Communists who were
                    there. It was that type situation. He had arrived subsequent to the arrival of
                    each of the ambassadors who headed each of the ICCS delegations. According to
                    protocol, he's to call on them; they're not to call on him. He was damned if he
                    was going to call on any of them. You can understand the problems, from a
                    diplomatic standpoint.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: And then you had four generals.</p>
                <p>We had a military attach�, Colonel Charles Wahle. I got to know him well, and we
                    became good friends. The air attach�, Colonel Garvin McCurdy, and I became
                    friends.</p>
                <p>At the first party we held, we invited the diplomatic corps, the press corps, or
                    a big percentage of it. We invited every officer from the ICCS, both military
                    and civilian, that was available, and all their female clerks. We invited a
                    smattering of people from various sections of the embassy. And, of course, other
                    diplomats from all the embassies. We borrowed the military attach�'s house,
                    which had been Westmoreland's mansion. If you know Saigon, you know that big
                    mansion Westmoreland had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I never went there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: You know it sat on a... It had a porte-coch�re and big rooms, and it was
                    great for throwing parties. We borrowed it to throw this party. We hired a dance
                    orchestra that played Myer Davis... style music. I enlisted the guy that ran the
                    ICCS club to cater it, on the basis there was not to be any profit. I'd help
                    him, look after him, but no profit. He agreed to this. You didn't take a loss,
                    but no profit. In the end, I think it cost about $1,250 for this party of about
                    300 people.</p>
                <p>I submitted the bill, but nobody was willing to pay it. They gave us $200. I was
                    out $1,000 at this point. You know, I just sat there on this $1,000. I said to
                    Pratt, “You got any money?”</p>
                <p>He said, “No. You know, I've got kids in college.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, maybe I've got to swallow this one.”</p>
                <p>In the meantime, the party was a real success.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>As a matter of fact, the New York Times correspondent who was there made the
                    crack to Pratt Byrd that he never saw so many spooks dancing with so many spooks
                    in all his life. You know, the place was just loaded with all these people
                    spying on each other.</p>
                <p>Then the chief of station came around and wanted to know when we were going to
                    throw another party like that one. So did the Colonel Wahle the senior military
                    attach�, come around. I said, “I can't afford to throw parties like that.
                    Nobody's paying for it.”</p>
                <p>Our boss was Joe Bennett, and Bennett said, “Well, I can get you $200.” But,
                    what's $200 to $1,250? Joe was the minister for political affairs.</p>
                <p>It was interesting, in the end, the military attach� tried throwing a similar
                    party, and none of these people would come to his party. We're talking ICCS
                    Communists.</p>
                <p>The CIA station chief tried to throw a similar party; none of these people would
                    come to his party. I mean a few, but just the top. And they wanted more than the
                    top.</p>
                <p>When they had their parties they fell on their faces. They made it so obvious
                    that they were targeting the communist delegations... nobody came except the
                    usual senior types.</p>
                <p>So then they came to us, both of them, with a chunk of money, and said, “Here's
                    your $1,000. When are you going to have another party?”</p>
                <p>I said, “I want it up front.”</p>
                <p>During our tour there until the fall of Saigon, we threw, I think, two or three
                    of those big parties, which got people together that you couldn't get out of the
                    woodwork otherwise. You never would have met them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression? Here was this outfit, the ICCS,
                        which was supposed to make sure that the truce held and that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Oh, it was a spying mission for the Communists. In the end, the Canadians
                    backed out, and the Iranians came in and took their place.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>I had to travel frequently, going around to all these different bases. Out of
                    this, I received quite an education as to what was really going on in Vietnam.
                    In the evening, when I'd be out at these various places all over the country, I
                    would go to the local American sponsored bar where the young men (because
                    everybody was there alone pretty much) hung out, these State, AID, and CIA
                    people all there, and talk to them about what they were doing and what was
                    happening out there. You know, things weren't going well; it was pretty obvious,
                    talking to these young people.</p>
                <p>For the record, there was one major incident which fully illustrates the extremes
                    we were willing go to kid ourselves about the truth of the situation in Vietnam.
                    There was a report of a mortar shelling of a grammar school yard full of playing
                    children down in the Canto area. The South Vietnamese government blamed the
                    communists. The ICCS investigated and said it was the South Vietnamese Army
                    which had been responsible. The embassy took the position that these children'
                    deaths were due to the communists. The pressure was on our office to give the
                    ICCS hell. Pratt was drafting a memo to that effect. In Germany my wife and I
                    had become friends with a couple who worked for the CIA through my wife's
                    involvement with the local women's club. This CIA officer was by then in Saigon.
                    Because his wife wasn't there, we would invite him to our home for diner
                    occasionally. We were working late the evening that all of this was happening
                    when he dropped by my office. Off the record, he told me he had just been with a
                    high ranking Vietnamese agent who had told him that the mortar shell had been
                    fired by mistake by the South Vietnamese Army. None of this ever came out at the
                    country team meeting. The embassy continued to insist that the communists were
                    responsible. Pratt Byrd and I shut up on that topic fast. We quit blaming the
                    communists.</p>
                <p>We paid all the bills for the ICCS through our embassy liaison office. These
                    countries weren't paying for this; this was part of the agreement. Other people
                    were supposed to kick in money, but nobody was but us. Since it was Kissinger's
                    idea, we, in the end, put up all the money. We contracted for more airplanes
                    from Air America than CIA did. I think about two-thirds of Air America was under
                    contract to ICCS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Air America was renowned as being a CIA operation,
                        although it was a commercial operation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: But we leased and had the ICCS insignia on these airplanes. More of their
                    airplanes were flying missions for ICCS than were flying for AID; they also flew
                    for AID. There was an AID office responsible for air operations, and the same
                    for CIA. But we had most of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, as a practical matter, the North Vietnamese knew what
                        was going on in South Vietnam. Obviously, they were getting good
                        information.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>THOMAS: Yet they were using these Communists delegations for quick passage of
                    information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I'm just trying to figure out what a Pole or a
                        Hungarian could really contribute.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Communication facility. Speedy communication. That was really what they
                    were contributing. Admittedly, they didn't know. They were like a lot of
                    Americans. But they could move information (because they had the right to move
                    information) much faster. It'd go to Europe and come right back.</p>
                <p>In time, we had a situation grow up there in which the ambassador's daughter
                    became a close friend or knew... Well, let's put it this way, the Iranian
                    ambassador, an older man in his '50s, had married a younger woman, a British
                    young woman, who had been working for the British Embassy in Rome where they
                    met. She was a pretty blonde; she was his third wife, I think. Martin had, I
                    think, been posted to Rome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He'd been ambassador to Rome, and, I think, had also been
                        administrative officer in Rome. So he was an old Roman hand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: That's right. Well, his daughter had become a close friend of this young
                    woman when she worked for the British Embassy in Rome while they were there. And
                    she had been working for MI6 in Rome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: British secret intelligence. She then married this Iranian ambassador who
                    was sent out to be ambassador to the ICCS for the Iranians. Here she was running
                    around with the ambassador's daughter in Saigon. The Iranian ambassador wanted
                    to socialize with our ambassador, but our ambassador refused. He didn't want to
                    set a precedent, because he didn't want to do any business with any of these
                    other ambassadors, especially the two Communist ambassadors.</p>
                <p>An Indonesian ambassador, who'd been there since the beginning, wanted to
                    socialize with our ambassador. He couldn't call on him, because for protocol
                    reasons, he couldn't do that. He made it pretty obvious to me that he felt that
                    this was wrong. He wanted to have a party in the ambassador's honor and have me
                    and Pratt Byrd there.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>First of all, the word got around through the ICCS that Pratt (whose wife wasn't
                    there; he was running back to the States regularly to see his family; he spoke
                    both Hungarian and Indonesian) was a spook. Therefore, people were more willing
                    to deal with me, in terms of the diplomatic problems, than they were with Pratt.
                    He was in and out of there, and so I was in charge a for extended periods
                    regularly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the big problems in Vietnam was the fact that we
                        had these R&amp;R trips out, and people's tours were relatively short, so it
                        was a little hard to keep a contact with anybody there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: That's right. I was there, and I was doing all the entertaining for the
                    office in my home, the dinner parties and all that stuff. The ambassador wasn't
                    entertaining any of these people. Any entertaining of their ambassadors, we
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving away from the social side...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: But it made a difference in terms of who got to know what and who got to
                    hear what. In the end, the social thing made for who was telling who what, and
                    who was learning what was going on, and what, in the end, happened as we got
                    further into the problem of the ICCS; what it ended up being able to do for us,
                    which was never clearly understood by the ambassador or by the embassy as a
                    whole. The communist delegations were there doing what you could expect them to
                    do, from the Communist side. They were acting as a communication link for their
                    espionage systems back to Saigon, and a very good one.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, one learned a lot about these Communist people, and you learned
                    many of them weren't very happy with the Russians. If you got to be friendly
                    with some of them, got to know some of them, they could be helpful to us, in an
                    informal, but very important, way. And that's, in essence, what happened in the
                    end.</p>
                <p>But I was starting to tell this story because the social things that occurred
                    caused many problems, and it had an effect on my relationship with various
                    people in that embassy.</p>
                <p>Consequently, I sat down and wrote a memo. Pratt was out of the country. The
                    Indonesian ambassador was pushing me for this dinner party for our ambassador.
                    Our ambassador sent word back to me that, no, just have him come in and call on
                    me. Well, I knew I couldn't say that, because you just couldn't do that. It was
                    against protocol. Anybody doing the calling would be our ambassador. I wrote a
                    memo explaining all this to our ambassador, and sent it through Joe Bennett, and
                    a drop copy to the then deputy chief of mission, who was a quiet sort of man who
                    didn't like rocking the boat. He was Wolf Lehmann's predecessor.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>Then the ambassador decided he wanted to have a meeting. Pratt got back, and he
                    wanted to have a meeting with the two of us. Since Pratt didn't know about my
                    memo, the ambassador asked me, about the word he sent down to me “What about
                    this meeting that I suggested you have him come in and call on me?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, Mr. Ambassador, didn't you get my memo?”</p>
                <p>He said, “What memo?”</p>
                <p>I looked at the DCM and the chief of the political section, “Didn't you give him
                    my memo?” Never got past them. They were scared to send it to him.</p>
                <p>I explained what was in it.</p>
                <p>It became obvious that I couldn't go through these guys and get anything done
                    because they were scared of the ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was an interesting person, let's put it this way. A
                        very difficult person.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: He turned to me and said, “You're right. I can't do that.”</p>
                <p>When I explained what was in the memo, he agreed with me.</p>
                <p>Nothing came of it all. But because of his daughter's relationship with the
                    Iranian ambassador's wife he started seeing the Iranian ambassador on the q.t.
                    This caused all type problems for us with the Indonesian ambassador. But he'd
                    only see him once in a while, because he said this was going to cause too many
                    problems.</p>
                <p>Most of the information that we were getting about what was happening in the ICCS
                    came from the Iranian ambassador who was a smart cookie.At the same time,
                    through contracts the ICCS had, its own communications net, a telephone system
                    that was separate from both the military and Vietnamese civil systems, both
                    micro wave and regular land lines had been installed by a contractor. ICCS had
                    its own logistics system and its own air system. It gave our office a great deal
                    of independence. It was all connected into and coming through our office, as was
                    the money for support of the ICCS coming through our office. That meant we had a
                    lot of leverage. But we had very little leverage with the front office in the
                    embassy. This become clearer all the time to all of us. We were frustrated
                    because we weren't getting any moral support. The money was there, and we were
                    paying it out. We could do anything we wanted on our own. I saw advantages, not
                    just disadvantages, in this situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>At the same time, I got to know many of these Communists. One of them was a Pole.
                    We had him for dinner, just alone, one night at my home. He became tight not
                    drunk. He started talking about his youth and how the Nazis had killed his whole
                    family. He then became a Communist. But became fed up with the Jews, because, in
                    Poland, the Jewish Communists were just looking after other Jews. You couldn't
                    get into a university if you weren't Jewish. It was a special game for them. He
                    went on a lot about that. It turned out he was a very devout Catholic. I
                    listened to all this. Over time, we got to be closer and more friendly; he'd
                    tell me pretty much anything I'd ask for.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, Pratt was home on leave. A young man, who was a West Pointer,
                    had been brought out there by the ambassador, whose son roomed with this West
                    Pointer while taking a Master's Degree here at Georgetown. This young man, named
                    Ken Moorefield, met the ambassador through the ambassador's son.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was killed in Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Moorefield had been decorated in Vietnam. He'd become a captain, had left
                    the Army, and was looking around for something to do. The ambassador offered him
                    a job, to come out to Vietnam as his personal aide. Ambassadors can do this. Ken
                    Moorefield ended up in the ambassador's office, and got bored stiff up there. It
                    was over-staffed with people; I think two or three secretaries. He just sort of
                    ran around... We met, got to kidding each other; although, I was older, he liked
                    me. He said he'd like to come to work as the junior officer in the section which
                    he did. Pratt was away, and he and I got to discussing my frustration with the
                    damned system, that nobody was paying attention to us, we were just third wheels
                    there, and yet this was a function that had to be done.</p>
                <p>He said, “What the hell. You know, you've got to make a political play sometimes.
                    Why don't you just go and walk into the goddamned country team meeting and sit
                    down?”</p>
                <p>I said, “You know, I think I've got a good mind that I'll just do that.”</p>
                <p>They had a country team meeting once a week. When the country team meeting came
                    up, I walk in and sat down. Joe Bennett looked at me with a stare of
                    astonishment. But I just smiled at him and nodded. Nobody there knew whether the
                    ambassador had invited me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, you've got to take into context that the
                        ambassador was known by some as almost a spider king. He played things very
                        close to his chest, so you never knew what the ambassador had in mind.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>THOMAS: That's right. I had this in mind when I did it, because the ambassador
                    had seen me say, “You didn't send my memo?” So the next time Pratt was out of
                    the country, I made this move. The ambassador greeted me pleasantly that
                    morning. It soon became obvious, because I kept going to these meetings, that
                    there were three people in the room that he treated with respect. I mean, he
                    didn't cuss them out. Because he'd just cuss people out in front of each other.
                    He'd give the AID director hell or the director of USIS. All these people had
                    worked for him before. They'd all been brought there by him. They all sort of
                    cowered in front of him. The only people he didn't pick on were Tom Polgar, who
                    was the CIA station chief; Colonel Wahle, who was the senior military attach�
                    there, who was the true military... (we had a general out there, for logistics
                    reasons, but he wasn't running the intelligence side of it); and me. He treated
                    us well. But the rest of the people got treated pretty badly in those
                    meetings.</p>
                <p>Out of going to those meetings, I started listening to all this stuff going on,
                    from this fellow who was a friend of Moorefield's, Frank Snepp.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He wrote a book, Decent Interval, which was very
                        controversial.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Snepp was the briefer for CIA. And listening to these briefings once a
                    week, I thought, Christ, this is 180 degrees out of phase with everything I hear
                    when I go on these trips. If they believe this stuff, everything was fine;
                    everything was rosy out there in the provinces. It was just the opposite, when
                    you went out there and talked to the junior officers doing the reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there in the spring of '73, how did you
                        see the situation? What was going on in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: My first trip out to the provinces didn't come until late summer of '73
                    because I was waiting for Pratt to arrive. We had to divide up the functions. He
                    said, “I'm going to be traveling a lot, going to the States to see my family.
                    I'll sit here in the office. You travel and come back and tell me what the
                    hell's going on.”</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>So I did an awful lot of traveling out to Hue, to Canto, and to all these
                    different places where they had these stations for the ICCS. I got to know all
                    the ex-master sergeants that had been hired to manage these places. I came to
                    understand the communications net they had. I had a telephone installed in my
                    office that was right on that communications net so that I could pick it up and
                    be into that net immediately. I had one put into my home, separate from the
                    regular telephone system, so that I could talk and be in communication with
                    these various bases and the Americans that were hired there, on my own, and find
                    out from them what was going on. In essence, I had a chain of information that
                    was separate from the embassy's. I had a transportation system, with the Air
                    America bit, that was separate from the embassy's. I could move around without
                    having to bother the embassy much. Since they were treating us pretty much as
                    separate anyway, until I got myself going to the country team meetings,
                    why...</p>
                <p>Because ICCS controlled so much of Air America, we were on the evacuation
                    committee. In other words, there was an evacuation committee that had been set
                    up as part of the standard embassy, with the air attach� being the chairman of
                    it, and the administrative counselor, the military attach� and myself being on
                    it. This comes in later in the story.</p>
                <p>From the time I got there, things were not going too badly, in the fall of '73.
                    You didn't find the negative aspects of the reporting that I was getting later
                    on. But, at that time, I wasn't going to country team meetings; so I didn't know
                    what was being said there. But things weren't so bad out in the provinces. There
                    had been a lull in the fighting. There seemed to be plenty of munitions
                    arriving. Everywhere I went were big ammunition dumps full of stuff for our
                    side. Everywhere. You'd go up near Pleiku, and there were just fields of
                    supplies and munitions. You found, let's say, up through '73, things seemed to
                    be going all right, relatively.</p>
                <p>But, as we got into '74, I was going to the country team meetings. Let's say
                    early spring '74, things were starting to turn around, and they didn't look as
                    good, in terms of the pressure being put on. Not that they were losing any
                    ground at that point, but there was more pressure, more fighting. From what I
                    gathered at the time... we were reporting, and I was reporting back with all I
                    was learning... One of the problems was that much of what I reported back I
                    reported to Pratt, and then he would write it up in cables. Well, we made an
                    agreement that, if the cable never got out of there (in many cases, it never
                    did; it never saw the light of day), we would keep the unsent cable form on file
                    in the chron file...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about from the top. Graham Martin kept a
                        very tight lid on what went in and out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I kept saying that this stuff should be going to Moscow, because Moscow
                    was as responsible for everything going on there as anybody. He wouldn't let us
                    send a drop copy of anything to Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our embassy in Moscow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Our embassy in Moscow. He wouldn't let us write anything to Moscow. I
                    felt that this was wrong. I believed that Kissinger's detente policy with the
                    Soviets was being falsely oversold as a part of a strategy to help Nixon who was
                    under attack over Watergate. Thus, nothing could be said that might indicate
                    that the Soviets were blatantly undermining the Paris Accords which they were
                    doing.</p>
                <p>When I first got there, only two members of the political section were what you'd
                    call liberal in political thinking (we're talking American politics), and that
                    was Pratt Byrd and me. There were 30-some officers in the political section.
                    That's a pretty big political section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, biggest in the world, at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I remember this was the fall of '73 and winter. They had a party for the
                    total political section that was hosted by the chief, Joe Bennett. I'd gotten to
                    be friendly with his wife, because she's Chinese and we talked Chinese. My wife
                    did too, because they took Taiji together. Joe liked me, but he was a
                    milquetoast, if you know Joe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Well, he was a very milquetoast fellow. Anyway, everybody was standing
                    around at this Christmas party, and, about this time, the whole Nixon thing was
                    the rage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about Watergate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Watergate was the rage topic. I made a bet with Joe Bennett in front of
                    everybody that Nixon would be out of office by the end of the next July.
                    Everybody there was for Nixon — oh, he was a great guy.</p>
                <p>A flashback comes to me re Vietnam; if I've told this story, stop me. The
                    flashback came right now that's important in all this, in terms of my approach
                    to Vietnam, in being there and having talked about it.</p>
                <p>At the time of the Geneva Conference in '54, there were certain people in the
                    embassy wanting to send me to Geneva, to be there for the... because Korea was
                    part of the...</p>

                    <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you did mention this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: All right. When I went off to language school and learned Korean at the
                    Army Language School, right after I got home from there, in '54, I met some of
                    my classmates from West Point, who had been in the Army and had been captains.
                    We'd sit around and drink at the officers' club (they were bachelors), in the
                    evening, and I'd preach the concept that, in Vietnam, we need special forces. We
                    need, not regular Army, we need support for them. But they've got to fight their
                    own war. We can't fight that. This is too nationalistic. It's not going to work,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>The thing that hit me, when I got to thinking about what they said, these young
                    captains said, “Look, Fred, what you say I think is true. But it'll never
                    happen, because of the military/industrial complex...” (You've got to remember,
                    this is the Eisenhower period.) “The military/industrial complex is too
                    important in our country. They will never let this happen, an American war will
                    be fought American style, with big tanks and all of that. The concept of special
                    forces and what you're talking about will never fly. It will always be American
                    style, because you can't sell big tanks to special-forces outfits.”</p>
                <p>Here we were, we got into Vietnam, and we were in the same old thing, but this
                    time, we were trying to teach them, much too late, to fight their own war. And
                    they weren't doing so well at it. The real trouble was that the leadership were
                    creatures of French colonialism and lacked the will to fight; they were too
                    corrupt.</p>
                <p>The thing I wanted to say was all the cables that we didn't get to send were
                    filed in with the cables we did. They were never torn up or thrown away. And
                    this was an agreement Pratt and I had. So that when we boxed everything up to be
                    shipped out of there, there was no time to go through anything. I didn't want to
                    go through anything. I wanted everything saved, just the way it was. So we boxed
                    it all up, at the end, and shipped it out. All that stuff was shipped. If
                    historians are interested, what we wanted to say, but never got out of there,
                    might be somewhere in archives.</p>
                <p>Well, I'm trying to think of where we left off here. By the next spring...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we're talking about '74.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Through early '74, things were not as bad as they became in '75. But, in
                    going into the fall of '74, you could see things turning downward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say “things,” what are you talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>THOMAS: When you went out to the provinces and you got to talking to the junior
                    officers, they would say, well...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were Vietnamese junior officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I didn't deal with Vietnamese junior officers, because, the Vietnamese
                    wouldn't have anything to do with me. The only Vietnamese who were allowed to
                    deal with me were General Hiep and a small group of people that were supposed to
                    deal with the Communists. They were allowed to deal with the North Vietnamese,
                    and they were allowed to deal with these delegations. But we were sort of
                    pariahs, because we supported the ICCS which was not popular with the South
                    Vietnamese government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the officers you were talking to were American
                        observers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Observers who were at the grassroots level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With our consulates general as part of this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Sometimes I would go to places where there weren't consulates general,
                    but there might be an AID guy out there, or there might be a CIA guy out there.
                    I'd just hook up with anybody that was there, that spoke English, that was
                    around. Usually I'd find a place to stay; maybe it'd be a local hotel, whatever.
                    But, generally speaking, I'd stay right on the ICCS base. The sergeant in charge
                    would have a place for me to stay. They had these little bases they'd built out
                    there for the ICCS, and you had four different groups there.</p>
                <p>Out of this, it was kept running, kept reporting. But it was frustrating,
                    because, as you say, Martin didn't tell anybody anything. You had to guess at
                    what was going on.</p>
                <p>I feel, from being there at the time, that he himself was partially responsible
                    for the speed with which Vietnam fell. However, as I said before, the basic
                    fault was with the Vietnamese leadership, their corruption and lack of will to
                    fight.As for Martin's responsibility, a lot of people didn't understand this,
                    but a lot has to do with psychology. He understood a lot about psychology;
                    therefore, he refused to request orders for people to get them out of there
                    because he didn't want to scare the Vietnamese. That was his argument for not
                    getting orders for the wives and families.</p>
                <p>Even before he did that, he made a major error. The major error came when he
                    returned to the States to lobby for more armament for South Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>There was so much armament (and I knew this from reading stuff and talking to the
                    military attach�s, because I'd become very close, socially, with them),
                    tremendous amounts of military supplies in the pipeline, and there was so much
                    money sitting around waiting and stuff to be shipped, that even if they cut off
                    the budget to nothing immediately, it would take two to three years to finish
                    off all this stuff. Talking about where they were going to cut the budget for
                    the South Vietnamese army this year wasn't going to have any immediate effect.
                    It was academic, really.</p>
                <p>But Martin was back here, making this big fight in front of Congress, publicly,
                    which was being read in South Vietnam, talking about giving up on our Vietnamese
                    friends. Of course, he was hoping to get the Americans involved, but that wasn't
                    going to happen, but it had its effect on Thieu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: President Thieu.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: By the winter of '74, things had gotten much worse. I felt that
                    everything I was hearing up at the country team was all pipe dreams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I sort of keep coming back to this, but you keep saying
                        things were getting much worse. Can you be specific? What are you talking
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: There was much more pressure, and the Vietnamese weren't handling it as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you talking about pressure...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Military pressure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, were the places...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Little places were starting to fall. Little places. People were starting
                    to pull back. Not in a big way, but in little ways. The North Vietnamese were
                    getting much more aggressive in the way they were handling things; you saw this
                    aggressiveness.</p>
                <p>Around the first of the year, '75, a province north of Saigon, Phuoc Long that
                    was up next to the border, fell. Anyway, the first real move came up there, on
                    the part of the Communists, I think it was in early January, and the Communists
                    took over that area. But everyone said, it's not too important; it's not like a
                    major victory. Everybody was down-playing it.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>Right after it happened, in walked three French nuns to see me. They said that in
                    the past, during the Tet Offensive (and I'd been out there at Tet in '68, on a
                    TDY), their people had been shot and killed in this town, and they didn't want a
                    repeat of this. They'd had two nuns who'd been captured by the Communists up
                    there, and was there anything I could do to help them?</p>
                <p>I thought a minute, and I said, “Yes, I think so. Just let me make a phone
                    call.”</p>
                <p>I called the Pole who I'd gotten to know personally, and who was said to be, by
                    our intelligence people, the chief of what is the equivalent of the Polish KGB
                    in Saigon. I explained what was going on to him about these French nuns, and
                    would he be willing to help them?</p>
                <p>He said, “Yes, send them over right away.”</p>
                <p>I sent them over to see him.</p>
                <p>I guess it was maybe two or three weeks later, in came the French nuns, with two
                    more, and an American with them, to thank me.</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, you don't need to thank me. You've got to thank that Pole.”</p>
                <p>They said, “We wanted to thank you first.”</p>
                <p>The Pole, I remember, was a good Catholic. These two French nuns spoke fluent
                    Vietnamese. They said they'd been terribly treated by the Vietnamese. Suddenly
                    everything changed. They overheard one of the guard saying that some orders came
                    out of Warsaw that they were to be given the VIP treatment. Everything changed,
                    and suddenly they were infiltrated back through the lines and let go. But it was
                    all due to this Pole.</p>
                <p>I thanked the Pole, and they thanked the Pole. It showed you some things can be
                    done in those situations, if one has made the right personal connection.</p>
                <p>That was the first evidence that things were not going well, in a big way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the ICCS doing what it was supposed to be doing in
                        this thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Our side was reporting back to their own governments, etc. For instance,
                    in the fall, before the Iranian ambassador left, he predicted the fall of
                    Vietnam by the summer of '75, and explained why and what was going on, from his
                    own observations with his own people there. I wrote this all up for our
                    ambassador. It was a big long report, concerning his own observations.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>Ban-me-thuot was the next place to have trouble.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was a major military center.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Up in the mountains, the south end of the defense of the central
                    highlands. It was easier to attack than Pleiku and Kontum to its north and much
                    less fortified. It had been the center of the area where the U.S. special forces
                    had worked with the Montagnard tribe to defend the area. When it fell, a
                    delegation of American missionaries called on me and asked for help. They had a
                    group of medical missionaries there. At the time of Tet in '68, all of their
                    staff there had been machine gunned by the communists. I immediately got in
                    touch with this same Pole; he made sure no Americans were killed. He gave me
                    periodic oral reports on what was happening to them. He told me they were being
                    moved out of the area of combat for their safety.</p>
                <p>The first thing that happened after the fall of Ban Me Thuot and during the time
                    Martin was back in the States... It was on a Saturday morning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When are we talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: March, I think. Maybe mid-March.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: March '75.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: (It was 15th March) I got a call from this retired master sergeant up at
                    Pleiku, on this direct line I'd had put into my own home, on a Saturday morning
                    at about lunch time, saying, “What do I do? I've got all these Poles and
                    Hungarians and everybody here in this base. The senior American here is an AID
                    official. He's quietly come around and told me and all the Americans to come
                    with him and get the hell out of there, and to tell only the Indonesians and the
                    Iranians that they were leaving, but not to tell the Communists, that there's a
                    pullback out of Pleiku.”</p>
                <p>I said, “No, don't do that. You stay there with those people. Your orders are to
                    stay there. Don't leave. And don't tell anybody anything at this point. I want
                    to know about what's going on. We're not going to play favorites in this
                    situation.”(The retired American sergeant later was given a decoration by the
                    Hungarians for remaining there.)</p>
                <p>I knew the thing was getting hairy. Ban-me-thuot had fallen. The military attach�
                    said, “We haven't got long here. This thing doesn't look good.” It had to do
                    with the Vietnamese leadership's lack of will to do anything. They didn't want
                    to fight. At Ban-me-thuot, our own military said, “No reason for this, except
                    they just didn't have the guts to fight.”</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>I went immediately to the embassy. Wolf Lehmann, who was...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was charg� at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I went into Wolf's office and said, “What in the hell is going on up at
                    Pleiku?”</p>
                <p>He said, “I just found out. Yesterday or the day before, President Thieu went up
                    to...” What was that place on the coast there? You know, the place that had the
                    naval base.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Cam Ranh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Cam Ranh Bay, that area there. He'd gone up there and called the CG of
                    the Second Corps. The Second Corps headquarters was at Pleiku. First Corps was
                    up at Hue, up in that area, but Second Corps headquarters was at Pleiku. He
                    called the commanding general down there, from that Corps Hq., and told him he
                    wanted him to make a strategic retreat out of Pleiku-Kontum and bring all his
                    troops back to the coast with an ultimate objective of protecting Saigon. He
                    hadn't consulted with the embassy. He hadn't consulted with anybody. But he'd
                    been listening to Martin back in the States scream about cutting aid, and he got
                    cold feet. There was ammunition galore up there; there was plenty of stuff to
                    fight a war with. But he ordered this, and this rout had started before we even
                    knew it was happening.</p>
                <p>The embassy got a message from Pleiku, from this AID official, who said he'd been
                    told by the general that he's pulling out and told them they should get out. And
                    then he went to the ICCS guy, who called me. This was how this whole episode
                    started.</p>
                <p>When this happened in this way, I told my people to stay, for the time being. The
                    others were all pulling out, and had pulled out. The rout was on. They walked
                    away from the big ammunition dump full of stuff up there in the highlands, and
                    moved back towards the coast, starting that morning, without our even knowing it
                    was going to happen. All because Thieu lost his nerve.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, we received orders to call, and only call, the Indonesians and
                    Iranians. This was Wolf Lehmann giving me these direct orders, in his office.
                    Kinsolving, the other ICCS liaison officer, was there, too. He was departing
                    that afternoon for a family visit and would be gone for several weeks. We were
                    not allowed to call anybody else.</p>
                <p>I said, “Christ, this thing is falling. These Communists, I've made connections
                    with them, and they can be of help in this situation in terms of saving American
                    lives. The American Marine Corps is not going to come in here and save lives. We
                    have Americans spread out all over this country.”</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>Wolf Lehmann was going to be a tough guy. Of course, like in the Army, you say,
                    “Yes, sir.”I wasn't about to give up yet. I went down the hall (this was on the
                    top floor) to the other end, to see the chief of station. I said, “This can't
                    be. You've got to go in there and talk him out of this idea. You've got some
                    connections in the Hungarian Mission.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it Shepley then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: No, it was Tom Polgar, a Hungarian Jew who spoke Hungarian. He said, “I
                    know the orders. I got the same orders.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Will you go in and ask him for permission for you to tell the Communists
                    that this is happening, so that we get some leverage with them out of this
                    goddamned situation.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're not going to hide it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I said, “First of all, you're not going to get the Communists to attack
                    the Poles and the Hungarians. They're not going to get hurt. The only people,
                    out of playing this little game, that have any chance of getting hurt are the
                    other two sides, plus the Americans. These people are the friends of the
                    Communists. What's the sense in this? This is just stupidity.” Polgar tried but
                    was turned down.</p>
                <p>I heard later, through the grapevine, that my whole arguments were not just
                    played out in that office; they were sent to Washington, via back channels,
                    saying, you know, I don't agree with this either, but here's what my orders are,
                    and here's what I... What happened to this argument was this ICCS liaison
                    officer suggesting this same thing. Polgar was told again by Lehmann that he
                    couldn't tell them.</p>
                <p>That night, I got a call from the Hungarian, who was a real Commie son of a bitch
                    of a young man, accusing me of just what Wolf Lehmann was trying to cause
                    happen, get them killed.</p>
                <p>I said, “What do you mean? I notified the Indonesian ambassador, who was
                    chairman...” They had a chairman for the month, every month, and it changed
                    every month. That month, it happened to be the Indonesian. I said, “He didn't
                    tell you? Why, I took for granted he'd tell you.” I shifted the whole goddamned
                    blame, right then and there. Of course, I didn't tell him not to tell anybody,
                    but it was taken for granted he wouldn't, and he didn't. So I shifted the blame,
                    because I wanted to have access to these people.</p>
                <p>From then on, I never went back to see Wolf Lehmann again, ever. I never went
                    near his office. I started doing my own thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>Moorefield and I started a pool betting on what day the place was going to
                    fall.</p>
                <p>Frankly, the ICCS people were out of Da-nang a week before our embassy started to
                    pull the consulate general out of Da-nang. Da-nang had to go out by sea, and
                    people nearly got killed there. It was so bad that, when I was getting the ICCS
                    out of there a week earlier, I was on a phone directly to the Air America people
                    who were landing planes at Da-nang to get them out. They didn't dare stop the
                    airplane. You had to be loaded on the run, because this plane would be swamped
                    with people. The planes would go down the runway, and we'd pick them up out of
                    Jeeps. I was on the phone, talking to the pilots when all this was going on. We
                    were getting people out of places when that's as bad as it is, while the embassy
                    hadn't done a damn thing at this point about getting anybody out.</p>
                <p>Because we got all these people out and nobody was hurt, I was somewhat of a hero
                    to the ICCS people. But I hadn't brought a damn word up to Wolf Lehmann or
                    anybody else. I just did my own thing.</p>
                <p>Moorefield was close with Snepp and a fellow named Don Hays. Hays was a young
                    officer in the Foreign Service who had done some duty temporarily as third man
                    in our office. He'd been rotated through there. These young guys came to me, and
                    said, “Look, you're the only senior officer in this whole embassy who seems to
                    realize this place is falling.”</p>
                <p>That was in early March. By mid March, towns had fallen. From the fall at Pleiku
                    in March up until nearly the end of March, my time was spent getting ICCS people
                    out and worrying about that, paying bills, and just doing my own thing, and not
                    talking to anybody else about it. I figured this would be useful.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, the Pole was looking after and keeping me informed of what was
                    happening to the Americans the Viet Cong had captured in various points around
                    the country, this the chief of Polish intelligence, who was very helpful.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>It was the last week in March. I was embassy duty officer starting at noon on a
                    Thursday 27 March.. That gave me certain power in the embassy because you see
                    everything that's coming in, and you've got the right to originate cables and
                    send stuff out. The air attach� called a meeting of the evacuation committee, as
                    chairman of it for Friday afternoon the 28th. Martin had arrived back early that
                    morning at about 3:00 am. Martin was “playing it cool” and paying no attention
                    to reality, he was just off in his own dream world, he refused to admit that
                    this place was falling around him. I arrived at the Air Attach�'s office
                    expecting to find the whole contingent of persons present who were listed as
                    members of the evacuation committee. I was by far one of the lesser lights on
                    the committee. Only three people were there: the Air attach� Garvin McCurdy, the
                    military attach� Chuck Wahle and me. Missing were the Administrative Counselor,
                    the Embassy Security officer, the Admin officers for USAID and for USIS, no one
                    from CIA and forgotten others. McCurdy asked if I had been able to get up to the
                    Ambassador's office. It seemed that the two attach�s had tried to see the
                    ambassador but had been stalled. I'd been up there; it was unreal. I said that
                    it was my opinion that the only hope for a successful evacuation to come off at
                    all was to do it without waiting for the embassy and the ambassador. I suggested
                    we confer with General Smith at Thon Sonuit Air Base. Col Wahle called the
                    General and we were on our way. General Smith heard my views on the situation in
                    the embassy; his response was supportive and positive. It was agreed that they
                    would begin bringing in military flights which would take any unofficial
                    Americans and their dependents out as soon as possible. The flight that crashed
                    with the orphans was scheduled at that time. The action officer was Smith's
                    deputy an Air Force BG, Richard Baughn. This was being doing strictly through
                    military channels. The flights were sent to Clark Air Base in the Philippines
                    without U.S. Embassy, Manila clearance. Our ambassador in Manila, Sullivan was
                    livid. General Baughn took the fall for this end run and was sent home because
                    of Sullivan's raising hell. This, however, was the beginning of the evacuation
                    of Vietnam - despite Martin's views.</p>
                <p>The coming Sunday was Easter, 30 March. My wife, our children and I had invited
                    the army attach�, Chuck Wahle and his wife to our home for Easter dinner. I was
                    still the duty officer, as I say, duty officer. I said something about the
                    situation to Chuck who said, “Get your wife an children out of here as fast as
                    you can. This thing is not going to last much longer.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes, I think you're right. Everything's falling.” We had already shipped
                    our dog, a black Labrador to my sister and her husband in California. I noted
                    that I would probably have to pay the fare for my family to leave because the
                    ambassador wasn't willing to send them out on government orders. Wahle said do
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>It was then a matter of gambling on the day that it was actually going to fall.
                    Monday morning arrived and I got a call from the code room, my orders had come
                    in from the Department. We were leaving early. I started to think about all
                    those security clearances I carried from my earlier assignment. They weren't
                    taking any chances of my being captured. The packers came in on Tuesday. My 15
                    year old son who loved to go to the air base to play basket ball came home early
                    that day and said he wanted to leave. He sensed the danger. I knew these younger
                    fellows Moorefield, Hays and Snepp wanted me to stay on; after conferring with
                    my wife, I went to Joe Bennett and volunteered to remain. Joe said “No, I have
                    four consuls generals walking the halls now with no assignments - forget it.”
                    The ambassador said leave but tell no one you are leaving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about these country team meetings? Was it still a rosy
                        picture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: By then, no. As a matter of fact, by then, I don't think they even had
                    them. There was too much pressure for that type stuff. You know, that was over
                    with.</p>
                <p>I said, “There's no reality to what's going on.”</p>
                <p>All these young officers knew it, including Snepp, as did the chief of station.
                    But you couldn't convince Martin. He was going to save the day. They were going
                    to stop before. they took Saigon. They wouldn't want to give up American aid,
                    and all that sort of... It was not believable.</p>
                <p>My duty officer stint was up on Thursday noon; I was scheduled to depart on
                    Friday 4 April by commercial aircraft. I turned over my personal car for
                    shipment on Thursday.</p>
                <p>Since I was ordered not to tell anybody I was leaving, any Vietnamese. General
                    Hiep, who was the ICCS general, was suddenly going to be made transportation
                    minister, under a temporary government. He came to me and asked me if I'd be his
                    unofficial advisor; I didn't dare tell him I was leavinHowever, there was one
                    hold on my departure, I had to await the return of Kinsolving from family visit
                    to take over the ICCS function. During this period after all of the ICCS
                    personnel had been pulled back into Saigon, it was necessary for me to reassure
                    the American contractor who ran their mess that he would be paid - just feed
                    them now. This was all done orally. No paper work. I didn't have time to tell
                    Kinsolving of my oral commitment. Later, in Washington I had to go to bat for
                    this man in order for him to be paid.</p>
                <p>The fall came, as you know, suddenly. By then, we had a pool going as to what day
                    the place was going to fall, and I think I was off by three days. The evacuation
                    of Saigon started early enough, and that's why we didn't have more Americans
                    caught there, but it was done without Martin's permission.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have a long interview that I did with Terry McNamara,
                        who was the consul general in Can- tho, and essentially he was left alone.
                        The CIA took care of their own and left, and he more or less had to line up
                        things. So he got out on his own.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I'll tell you why. I was at the embassy at the time; I pulled the ICCS
                    out of Can-tho long before... The only reason they didn't want to pull anybody
                    out was because it would look like the place was falling. This was Martin's own
                    doing, so he insisted everybody stay in place. You couldn't even ship your wife
                    out unless you did it with your own money. The place was seething with anger
                    because people wanted their wives and children out of there. Mine were the first
                    to come in, but then they allowed others in. It was a terrible situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left when, and when did it fall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I left on April 4th, and it fell on the 28th.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I flew to Hong Kong and stayed in Hong Kong a while. I was so worried
                    about friends there and people there, you know, Americans and other people, that
                    I just didn't want to leave. But I'd been ordered to go. I even volunteered to
                    stay, but wasn't allowed to. Hong Kong was a little too expensive, so we then
                    went on to Taiwan, and stayed there for a while. Nobody was pushing to get me
                    back to the States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had too many people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Laos had already fallen, and there were all these people out of Laos. I
                    stayed in Taiwan for a while.I think we spent three weeks in Asia, until the
                    fall. I saw some friends, I think, in Tokyo, who had gotten out as it fell. Then
                    we came on back to the States and stayed for a while on the West Coast with my
                    brother-in-law and sister. I talked to people who got out right at the end, but
                    it didn't get any better. The realism.</p>
                <p>Thank God for a few people there like Snepp, Moorefield, Hays and Lacy Wright. I
                    think they received some medals out of it. They deserved them because they were
                    the ones who really organized to get things moving.</p>
                <p>Our effort was the first, the attach�s and my meeting with General Smith started
                    the airlift that moved non-official Americans. Without that early start many
                    Americans would have been endangered. But, there were still a lot of people left
                    behind, who paid the price for our inept policies.</p>

                <p>THOMAS: The Department, nobody wanted me back here. Nobody wanted any of us back
                    here. When I got back, I went into the Department, and I was told to stay on
                    leave, administrative leave, which meant you didn't pay for it. We couldn't keep
                    staying with relatives. We decided get back into our own house. There were no
                    jobs at the Department. The oil crisis was still brewing. It was the mid-''70s,
                    late ''70s, and they had all these research projects going, on petroleum and the
                    shortage of oil. I was sent out to do that. It was just make-work. I ended up
                    doing research on oil, going out to the Department of Energy. I had these
                    clearances, and these clearances let me go to a lot of places and see a lot of
                    documents. But it was no job, really.</p>
                <p>I kicked around with nothing really to do. They talked about giving me some more
                    Chinese to bring my Chinese back, there was no job in Beijing at the time.</p>
                <p>I was a year in limbo with no real job. It was more than that. They ended up
                    giving me a research INR type job, which was dullsville, sort of intelligence
                    analysis, which I found not my thing.</p>
                <p>Desai had taken over in India, and they thought there was a big break in India,
                    with Desai in.</p>

                        Gandhi.</hi>

                <p>THOMAS: They thought there would be more commercial opportunities that I could
                    maybe get some American investments, do what I'd done in Germany. What I'd been
                    able to accomplish in Germany preceded me. I said, “If that's what I've got to
                    do to get out of the country and get a post.” I agreed to go off to New Delhi
                    into that job.</p>
                <p>Right after I got there, Desai turned out to be even worse than Indira had been.
                    He insisted that Coca-Cola turnover their formula. He wanted some things out of
                    IBM that they weren't willing to give him. Both of them closed up shop and
                    walked out. When they did it, nobody was interested in investing anything in
                    India. I had the Delhi belly for months on end.</p>

                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: The ambassador to India was a man named Goheen, a Greek scholar out of
                    Princeton. We had a fellow named Wyles, I think, who was the administrative
                    counselor who was an ex-chief in the Navy. We had some type of foreigner, who
                    had an American passport, who was running the commissary. The prices in the
                    commissary were horrendous, with everybody up in arms about the costs and
                    prices. We'd been there two weeks when I went to a meeting. Wyles was back in
                    this country on TDY, arranging for another four-year tour (he'd been there four
                    years), to stay on in India. Everybody was screaming about the costs at the
                    commissary, etc. I got up and made a speech about what I'd found out about the
                    commissaries in Germany and Karachi. According to law, the commissary really
                    belonged to the membership. If you looked at the constitution of the commissary
                    in India, it put all the real power in the hands of the ambassador's
                    administrative counselor. That didn't mean that constitution had to stay that
                    way, because the law stated that the membership had a right to change the
                    constitution any way they wanted. The first thing you had to do was rewrite the
                    constitution.</p>
                <p>I got a big hand of applause from everybody when I made this little speech.
                    Consequently I was elected to chair a committee to change the constitution of
                    the commissary. I turned around and asked for volunteers to sit on the
                    committee. No officers volunteered; only one officer's wife offered to be on the
                    committee. Everybody else was a clerk, a code clerk or a clerk of some type, on
                    this committee.</p>
                <p>Within about three or four days after this thing was set up, I got a call from
                    this young Princetonian who had the same job Moorefield had. He'd been brought
                    out there (tennis anyone? good looking, handsome boy, with a young wife) as aide
                    to Ambassador Goheen. He came in to tell me what the ambassador wanted in that
                    constitution.</p>
                <p>I looked at this young man and said, “I wasn't elected by the ambassador. I was
                    elected by the membership of the club. Once we've decided on the constitution,
                    I'll send a draft around for the ambassador to look at. If he doesn't like it,
                    he can tell me so. But, until then, well, let's not worry about what the
                    ambassador wants in it. Right now, I'm worried about what the people who're
                    serving here want in it.”</p>
                <p>He went back and told the ambassador. That didn't make me very popular with the
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>The constitution was rewritten. In the meantime, my job was nothing, really. I
                    wasn't getting anybody to invest. My boss, Bryant, who was the senior commercial
                    attach�...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Edward Bryant.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>THOMAS: He looked on me as trouble, in the commercial sense, because I had a
                    fairly senior rank, and I was a third wheel there, and, you know, they really
                    didn't need me. I was always coming up with new ideas, and who likes new ideas;
                    they only cause problems.</p>
                <p>I just said, “Well, what the hell. I don't like this post, anyway. I'm not
                    getting along or going to get along very well with Goheen. So I'm going to get
                    myself out of here, if I can. But, in the meantime, I'll do what I can.”</p>
                <p>So we rewrote the constitution. It put the power into the hands of an elected
                    board. There was to be a chairman of the board who was to be elected by the
                    membership. The ambassador put out word that he wanted to make sure that I was
                    not elected chairman of the board of that commissary. He got somebody to agree
                    to run, who was head of the NSA unit there. He was a guy who got up and made a
                    funny speech. At the meeting after he was elected, I was asked “Was there any
                    job I preferred to have, because I'd arranged all this?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes, I'd like to be chairman of the by-laws committee.”</p>
                <p>It's one thing to have a constitution, but the next thing, in terms of power, is
                    the by-laws. I said, “I'd like volunteer to sit on the by-laws committee.”</p>
                <p>Well, by this time, all the officers in the place were coming around on the q.t.
                    and saying, “Go to it. We're all for you.” They didn't want to be openly for me,
                    because the ambassador was backing Wyles, who was the guy fighting me.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, I wasn't given a house to live in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the problem with Wyles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: There was stealing going on. You couldn't prove this. First of all, the
                    manager had been brought there by Wyles. He had one source, and one source only,
                    for everything they sold in the commissary. It was out of Texas. It was the
                    source of everything they sold, in terms of canned goods, anything. It came from
                    this one source. The prices were horrendous. I wanted to get rid of this
                    manager, and I wanted to put an American in charge. This manager had been given
                    a diplomatic passport. Wyles had gotten it for him. He'd been given a very fancy
                    house to live in, which the embassy was paying for. He was getting a big salary,
                    much more than the average Foreign Service officer. this stunk to high heaven.
                    You couldn't prove anything, but this looked to me to be a coterie of these guys
                    sitting in administration back in Washington; that this whole thing was making
                    money for several people.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>Goheen was being fired up by Wyles, saying, “You're in charge here, and these
                    people are taking away your power, etc.” And Goheen wanted no part of it. He
                    called a meeting with me, you know, in terms of discussing the issues. I just
                    explained that these are adult people, and you can't treat them like children.
                    He was madder than hell at me. Present in the meeting was the DCM, Arch Blood
                    whom I liked. Arch stuck his neck out when he'd been up in Dacca.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: Based on the stories I'd heard about Arch Blood, I had a lot of respect
                    for him. But he wasn't saying much; he was just listening because this fight was
                    pretty open. I said, “We have to change what's going on here.”</p>
                <p>In the end, it was changed. They got rid of that manager. Wyles, who had arranged
                    an extension for four years, suddenly asked for a transfer out of there, to go
                    on to Brussels as administrative counselor.</p>
                <p>All this time, I was trying to get an inspector general's investigation of the
                    situation. But they were trying to shut me up. They didn't want to spread any of
                    this in the open. There were other reasons and other things that you'd get to
                    know out of a thing like that, that I knew that I couldn't talk about openly,
                    because I couldn't prove it in a court of law. It was like that guy sitting
                    outside a window, listening to that American sell America out. It was big
                    corruption in the commissary, and big stealing.</p>
                <p>In the end, it changed. My orders came. I'd asked to get out of there early, and
                    I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Delhi from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THOMAS: I arrived there in, let's say, October of '77, and departed in June of
                    '78. I had the school year with my kids there.</p>
                <p>Goheen had left on home leave; I went in to make my final call on Arch Blood; I
                    apologized for not having accomplished anything, in terms of my job there. He
                    said, “Oh, you've accomplished a lot. What you did for this commissary and the
                    morale here has been worth, you know...”</p>
                <p>I took off for Washington. There was no real job back here, really. They kept
                    kicking me from pillar to post. Suddenly, at a Christmas party here, I met
                    someone from a large corporation; he heard I was a China linguist and that I was
                    looking around; I was sort of fed up with bureaucracy. He said he thought he
                    could line up a job with his corporation, and a new big contract they had in
                    China. This was the winter of '78, Christmas time, and I listened to him.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>In the spring of '79, I just decided I'd had it. I retired in June, with no
                    written commitment, but an oral commitment, that I would be hired by this
                    company to go to China for them.</p>
                <p>Just as I retired, the Chinese pulled the rug out from under this company and a
                    lot of others. They got scared they were spending too much money, and they
                    cancelled all these contracts. I'd retired, suddenly, into what I thought was
                    going to be a job. It wasn't a job, because it disappeared.</p>
                <p>I tried to start a consulting business on China. I was just getting started, when
                    I was hit from the rear in a terrible automobile accident. It was two to three
                    years before I came out of the shock from that, the trauma.</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, what the hell. I'm going to enjoy my retirement.” I became
                    involved in local political affairs.</p>
                <p>That was pretty much my State Department career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I want to thank you very much. Fred. This has been
                        very illuminating.</hi>
