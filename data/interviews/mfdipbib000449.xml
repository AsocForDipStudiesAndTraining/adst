                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is March 17, St. Patrick's Day, 1995. This is an
                        interview with Ambassador Marshall Green. Our subject today will concern
                        Southeast Asia and, particularly, Cambodia. I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Mr.
                        Ambassador, I'm going to turn it over to you to talk about whatever you'd
                        like to say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Cambodia has not been a central part of my career, which has concentrated
                    on Northeast Asia—China, Japan, and Korea—and also the Pacific Islands and
                    Indonesia. However, as far as Indochina is concerned, I was drawn into events
                    during three assignments: 1) as Regional Planning Advisor for the Far East
                    (1956-60); as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the Far East (1963-65); 3)
                    as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific (1969-73). Most of
                    my comments will relate to (3) above, because of major differences between the
                    White House and State Department over US Cambodian policy, including President
                    Nixon's decision to commit US ground forces in the Cambodian incursion of 1970.
                    I believe that my account of that period contains information that has not
                    appeared in any publications to date.</p>
                <p>The first section, which is rather short, relates to two trips which I took to
                    Cambodia when I was Regional Planning Adviser (in the Bureau of Far Eastern
                    Affairs).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What period was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I held that position from 1956 to 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was during the Eisenhower presidency.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, that's right. I was working for Walter Robertson (Assistant Secretary
                    of State for Far Eastern Affairs), whose job was then taken over in 1959 by his
                    deputy, Jeff Parsons. I made two trips to Cambodia during this period. In 1956
                    my wife and I took a trip through the whole area just after I was named Walter
                    Robertson's Regional Planning Advisor. At that time Cambodia was pretty
                    isolated, had bad relations with (the Republic of) Vietnam and Thailand, on two
                    of its borders. It had no relations with Laos, which is a rather wild country
                    and hard to understand. Cambodia had been a French colony (Protectorate) and the
                    officials we met there spoke French. When we visited Cambodia in 1956, we stayed
                    with Mac Godley who later became Ambassador to Laos after being Ambassador to
                    the (former Belgian) Congo. The Ambassador to Cambodia at this time was Rob
                    McClintock.</p>
                <p>I'll mention a few things about Rob McClintock, because they tell you something
                    of the problem we had with Cambodia. He was one of the brightest people in the
                    Foreign Service, but he couldn't help parading his superior knowledge and
                    intellect before others. In the case of Cambodia, this was a very serious
                    drawback, because there was only one man in Cambodia who was supposed to excite
                    any kind of veneration and respect—or to be in the headlines. That was Prince
                    Sihanouk. As the Prime Minister and the Prince, he was completely in charge of
                    the country. The whole history of Cambodia during the last half century has
                    revolved around Prince Sihanouk.</p>
                <p>During this first visit I heard that Rob McClintock conducted business in a way
                    that grated on the nerves of many Cambodians, especially Sihanouk, whom he
                    addressed without the deference which Sihanouk expected and which was his due.
                    Rather, McClintock had a habit of carrying a field marshal's baton with him,
                    which he used at the staff meeting I attended to emphasize his points.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, my God, no!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: We had problems with Sihanouk, on and off, all during the time that I was
                    Regional Planning Advisor (in the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs). As Regional
                    Planning Advisor, my principal aim was to develop some kind of constructive
                    relationships between all of the countries in the Asia-Pacific region with which
                    we had strong commitments: military, economic development, or exchange student
                    support. However, all of these countries were at each other's throats. So I
                    spent four years trying to bring about a certain degree of reconciliation.</p>
                <p>As I think I've told you before, Stu, Washington at that time could best be
                    described in its relationships with East Asian countries as being the hub of a
                    wheel, with spokes going out to all of these different capitals: to Tokyo,
                    Seoul, Manila, and so forth. But there were no relationships between the ends of
                    those spokes: between Tokyo and Seoul, between Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur, between
                    Phnom Penh and Saigon, between Phnom Penh and Bangkok, and so forth. And, of
                    course, Burma had no relations with anybody.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>On my second trip to Cambodia in 1959, as assistant to J. Graham (Jeff) Parsons,
                    Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, I recall that we first
                    visited Burma and then Bangkok. I left my wife there while Jeff and I flew up to
                    Vientiane, Laos. From there we flew to the ancient Laotian capital, Luang
                    Prabang, which is really out of this world. That's where the Prince Heritier
                    (Crown Prince), who was really the King or the ruler of Laos, lived. But he had
                    no control over eastern Laos, which was under Hanoi's control or over
                    northernmost Laos which was under Chinese control.</p>
                <p>But my point about the visit to Laos was that Laos was so distant in time. Jeff
                    and I had an audience with the Prince Heritier—all three of us on separate
                    divans. At a command from the Prince Heritier three servants came charging into
                    the room and prostrated themselves on the floor, sliding the last five feet or
                    so, holding up cigarette boxes. We each took out a cigarette. Then the Prince
                    clapped his hands and three more servants came running in, holding up lighted
                    brickets to light our cigarettes. This is the kind of service you can't get in
                    Washington. (Laughter.)</p>
                <p>As we left the palace, we were serenaded by what passed for a military band. It
                    looked like something out of “Babar and the Elephants.” If there had been
                    monkeys and elephants playing instruments, I wouldn't have been the least bit
                    surprised.</p>
                <p>Then we flew down to Saigon (where Lisa rejoined us) with the idea of our going
                    on to Cambodia the next day. In Saigon we learned from Ambassador Trimble in
                    Phnom Penh that Parsons would be seen, not by Sihanouk, who was in Paris, but by
                    Son Sann, who was the Acting Prime Minister. This shows you how influential we
                    were in East Asia at that time.</p>
                <p>Trimble mentioned that all the diplomatic corps was invited, including the
                    Chinese Ambassador. This would have been Peking's Ambassador. Standing State
                    Department instructions in those days prevented any American official from
                    attending any party where the Chinese Ambassador was a fellow guest. So we
                    immediately wired back to Bill Trimble asking whether the Chinese Ambassador was
                    actually attending. At that point a tropical storm knocked out all
                    communications and we had no way of getting our message through to Phnom Penh,
                    not even through French rubber plantation owners, which was another possible
                    channel of communications. However, all communications were out.</p>
                <p>Jeff thought this over and decided to send me alone the next day to do the honors
                    on his behalf.</p>
                <p>So the next morning I set off on a special executive plane provided us by CINCPAC
                    (Commander in Chief, Pacific). As we approached the Phnom Penh airport, to my
                    horror, I could see what seemed like the whole cabinet and diplomatic corps
                    lined up near the point of landing, plus a military guard of honor. A “march
                    past” was obviously scheduled with the troops all dressed up with their pennants
                    and other regalia.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>When we landed, and I stumbled out of the plane, there was the Cambodian Chief of
                    Protocol. He asked, “O� est M. Parsons?” (Where is Mr. Parsons?) I had to
                    explain Mr. Parsons had a “crise d'estomac” (stomach ache) and could not travel
                    on the plane “car il manque un w.c.” (as it lacked a toilet). The Cambodian
                    officials were crestfallen. They dismissed the band and all of the rest of the
                    welcoming party. I went to the Embassy car waiting for me, and there was
                    Ambassador Trimble. He was absolutely ashen-faced. He said, “Didn't you get my
                    telegram?” I said, “No, what telegram?” He said, “I wired that the Chinese
                    Ambassador wouldn't' dream of going to any party where an American official was
                    going to be the guest of honor.” I said, “Well, we never got it.” He said, “What
                    are we going to do? We've got to go ahead with this big party.” I said, “Let's
                    send the plane back.” It wasn't very far—the round trip would take about two
                    hours. The next thing we knew, two or three hours later, Jeff Parsons arrived
                    with my wife, with Jeff lamely explaining to the Chief of Protocol that he had
                    been miraculously cured.</p>
                <p>There was a big ceremony out at the airport. Jeff went through all of the honors
                    denied me, while the Cambodians acted as if nothing was amiss. That evening we
                    attended a lavish dinner at the palace seated at the longest table and the
                    finest nappery I had ever seen, all under a row of massive chandeliers. Jeff
                    Parsons had the seat of honor, next to the Acting Prime Minister. Everyone was
                    served course after course of exotic foods—all, that is, except Jeff. All he was
                    given was a bowl of boiled rice, out of thoughtful consideration for his
                    indisposition. That's the way the Cambodians got back at him (Laughter), and it
                    gives you a sampling of how we deal with Cambodia and how Cambodians deal with
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you. In 1956, where did Cambodia rank in
                        Pacific or East Asian affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I would say that it ranked rather low until we became more involved in the
                    wars in Indochina after 1963. We were increasingly concerned over how North
                    Vietnam was violating Cambodia's neutrality, largely in the form of its Ho Chi
                    Minh Trail to South Vietnam which led through Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But couldn't we prevail on those who had signed the Geneva
                        Accords of 1954 to reaffirm support for Cambodia's neutrality?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Nothing effective could be done through diplomatic channels because of
                    Hanoi's obduracy. Since both Moscow and Peking were competing for influence with
                    Hanoi, they refused to take issue with Hanoi's position in this matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I assume Cambodia lacked the military power to keep
                        the North Vietnamese out.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>GREEN: Absolutely, and that's why Sihanouk felt so strongly that Cambodia's only
                    hope for survival as a nation lay in trying to gain as much international
                    support as possible for Cambodia's neutral status. With that I agreed, much as I
                    disliked Sihanouk personally with his vanities, prickliness, squeaky voice, and
                    long periodic absences from Cambodia to take “the cure” on the French Riviera.
                    He was nevertheless revered by many Cambodians as “the soul” of his country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, as I recall, you left the Far East Bureau to become
                        Ambassador to Indonesia from 1965 to 1969. Did you have any dealings with
                        Cambodia during that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: No, but neither did the US government have much contact. That had much to
                    do with some ill-advised CIA operations against Dap Chuon, a Cambodia provincial
                    governor, which led to Sihanouk's refusal to receive our newly appointed
                    Ambassador to Cambodia, Randy Kidder. (So in effect we had no diplomatic
                    relations with Cambodia from 1965 to 1969.)</p>
                <p>On August 17, 1965, shortly after my arrival in Indonesia as Ambassador,
                    President Sukarno of Indonesia announced before a huge national day gathering,
                    including delegations from China and North Korea, the formation of a new
                    Peking-Pyongyang-Hanoi-Jakarta-Phnom Penh axis. In actuality this did not mean
                    that Cambodia had abandoned its neutrality or that it had closed ranks with the
                    Asian communist countries in any way. What it did signify was Sihanouk's
                    personal friendship with Sukarno and his desire to gain greater leverage in his
                    dealings with Hanoi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that normal diplomatic relations were
                        restored between Washington and Phnom Penh in 1969, and, as I recall, this
                        was the result of goodwill missions President Johnson sent to Cambodia, one
                        of those missions being headed by Chester Bowles, our Ambassador to India at
                        that time. Now early in 1969 you were detailed to our delegation at the
                        Paris Peace Talks on Vietnam. How did Cambodia feature in those talks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Surprisingly little, to the best of my memory. Of course, it was at that
                    time, early in 1969, that the US was beginning a series of secret B-52 attacks
                    against Viet Cong sanctuaries in Cambodia. But at that time we knew nothing
                    about those air raids, either in Paris or in the State Department. (Secretary
                    Rogers may have been informed. I just don't know.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yet Sihanouk must have been aware of these B-52 raids
                        involving Cambodian targets. Why didn't he protest?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>GREEN: I can only suppose that, if he did know, he kept quiet about it, because
                    there wasn't much he could do to stop the raids and he wouldn't want to
                    advertise his inability to do so. Moreover, if he did know, he might have
                    derived some satisfaction that the hated Vietnamese in Cambodia were being
                    bombed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there must have been some American officials in Phnom
                        Penh who knew. Here you are sitting in a country which was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: You would think so, Stu, but in fact no American in Phnom Penh or
                    Washington was in the know except for very few in the White House, DOD and
                    probably CIA. Besides, we had no official relations with Cambodia at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>Let me now turn to a major development that occurred in September 1969 when
                    Sihanouk visited Hanoi to attend Ho Chi Minh's funeral. While in Hanoi, he
                    entered into certain secret agreements with the North Vietnamese Prime Minister
                    regarding the amounts of North Vietnamese supplies Sihanouk would allow to be
                    shipped through the Cambodian port of Sihanoukville to Viet Cong and North
                    Vietnamese forces operating in easternmost Cambodia against the South
                    Vietnamese. The amounts involved were not large.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did this so-called Hanoi-Phnom Penh understanding
                        last?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Not long. Some weeks after Sihanouk's trip to Hanoi, he tried to visit two
                    northern provinces (Mondolkiri and Ratnakiri) but he found that he couldn't even
                    enter these provinces which were under the tight control of Hanoi. That's when
                    Sihanouk suddenly realized the true dimensions of the problem he faced in
                    keeping the Vietnamese out of his country. It was probably at this point that he
                    decided on the fateful trip to Moscow and Peking that he undertook several
                    months later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did our government react to all these
                        developments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I don't recall that we were aware of all the foregoing events until a bit
                    later. On the other hand, we had a number of practical problems in our relations
                    with Cambodia, problems that involved Congress.</p>
                <p>It was in October 1969 that I first met with Senate Majority Leader Mike
                    Mansfield at the suggestion of Secretary Rogers (and presumably with White House
                    approval).</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>One of the practical issues was to find out whether Congress would be likely to
                    approve the funds needed to meet Cambodian defoliation claims against the US I
                    can't recall the origin or reasons for those claims but I do recall that both
                    Mansfield, and subsequently Nixon, believed such claims should be paid by the US
                    In fact, John Holdridge, an FSO detailed to Kissinger's staff, phoned me to say
                    that the President reacted very favorably to the idea advanced in a memo I
                    wrote. I mention this point specifically because it shows how closely the White
                    House and State were cooperating on Cambodia at this stage, both together and
                    with Congress.</p>
                <p>Another issue I discussed with Mansfield was the question of assigning any CIA
                    personnel to our Embassy in Phnom Penh. State was opposed, while the White House
                    favored it. But both CIA (Dick Helms) and Mansfield sided with State on this,
                    and the idea was dropped because of Sihanouk's hypersensitivity to the CIA after
                    the ill-fated Dap Chuon incident.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Turning to the fundamental issue of Cambodia's future, how
                        did the US plan to cope with the way North Vietnam seemed to be taking over
                        parts of Cambodia. You mentioned two provinces already under their effective
                        control, as well as the Ho Chi Minh Trail and Viet Cong privileged
                        sanctuaries in areas of Cambodia bordering South Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: At that stage—that is in late 1969 and early 1970—the White House and
                    State seemed to be agreed on doing all we could to uphold Cambodia's neutrality.
                    That seemed to be the only effective way of preserving Cambodia's territorial
                    integrity.</p>
                <p>With the approval of Secretary Rogers, I met several times with French Ambassador
                    Lucet in Washington to discuss how best to promote international support for
                    Cambodia's neutrality, since the French seemed to be so keen on the idea. I also
                    visited Paris to discuss this issue with Froment-Meurice who was my counterpart
                    in the Quai d'Orsay (French Foreign Ministry), and the French were seeking to
                    promote support for Cambodian neutrality with China through the efforts of their
                    Ambassador in Peking, Etienne Manac'h.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there some kind of international group composed of
                        representatives of Japan, Indonesia and Malaysia that was seeking agreement
                        among all the principal powers on respect for Cambodia's neutrality?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: You're right, but I can't recall the timing of this international group's
                    efforts. I think it was a bit later that they visited Washington as well as
                    Moscow, Peking, London and other key capitals. But their effort got no positive
                    results because of Hanoi's strong opposition conveyed to Moscow and Peking.
                    Anyway, it was all a futile exercise because of what was about to happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>GREEN: Sihanouk left Cambodia in late January 1970 for France where he planned to
                    spend a couple of months on the Riviera for health reasons. He did this often,
                    but on this occasion he may have had in mind to extend his absence from Cambodia
                    in order to visit Moscow and Peking with regard to North Vietnam's operations in
                    Cambodia. Anyway, Sihanouk departed for Paris, leaving the government in the
                    hands of General Lon Nol and his Foreign Minister Sirik Matak.</p>
                <p>During Sihanouk's absence in France, there were growing student-led
                    demonstrations in Phnom Penh against corruption involving the Sihanouk
                    government in general, prominently including Princess Monique, Sihanouk's wife,
                    who was running gambling casinos. There was also resentment against Sihanouk's
                    inability to keep the Vietnamese out of Cambodia. Overall, it was clear that the
                    better educated Cambodians were tired of Sihanouk's rule and had no trouble in
                    gaining the support of students and the military. The peasantry was not
                    involved, remaining loyal to Sihanouk.</p>
                <p>Starting with demonstrations in Svay Rieng Province, followed by the sacking of
                    the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong Embassies in Phnom Penh by thousands of youth
                    (probably with Lon Nol's connivance), Sihanouk angrily left France for Moscow on
                    March 13. It was at that stage the views of State and the White House began to
                    diverge.</p>
                <p>The deposing of Sihanouk by unanimous vote of the National Assembly on March 18
                    marked the beginning of a new era in Cambodia, which the State Department saw as
                    fraught with dangers but which the White House saw in terms of opportunities to
                    build up Lon Nol and strengthen the FANK (Cambodian army). President Nixon asked
                    me to draft several personal Nixon-to-Lon Nol telegrams containing rather
                    extravagant expressions of friendship and support. I was concerned that Lon Nol
                    would read into these messages a degree of US military support and commitment
                    that exceeded what our government could deliver on (given Congressional
                    attitudes in particular).</p>
                <p>I also regarded Lon Nol as lacking the qualities needed to lead his country out
                    of its mess. I further downgraded him for having sent his family to Singapore
                    for its safety, while the US kept its Embassy families in Phnom Penh partly in
                    order to show our confidence in the Lon Nol government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But hadn't things progressed to the point where any
                        restoration of Sihanouk was out of the question?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: You're right, Stu. A solution based on Sihanouk's restoration was by then
                    out of the question, at least for an indefinite time. So what to do?</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>This prompted me to prepare a recommendation in the form of a 4-page memorandum
                    reviewed and approved by my colleagues in State, including INR. With Rogers'
                    approval, it was sent to Al Haig, Kissinger's deputy, since he was emerging as
                    the key man in the White House on Cambodian policy.</p>
                <p>The memo analyzed Peking's and Hanoi's conflicting interests and motivations with
                    regard to Cambodia. Peking, for example, probably saw its interests served by an
                    Indochina composed of separate “independent” states, whereas Hanoi seemed bent
                    on making all of Indochina subservient to Hanoi.</p>
                <p>As to US policy, I warned against active US intervention in Cambodia since that
                    would inevitably connote a continuing US responsibility to sustain its
                    government and that could not be achieved without a sustained large deployment
                    of US forces there—an eventuality which was politically impossible given the
                    mood of our Congress and people. Under the circumstances, our policy should be
                    one of “waiting on events, saying little except acknowledging our broad support
                    for Cambodia's neutrality.” (France was still hoping to entice Sihanouk back to
                    France and thence to have him return to Cambodia possibly with Soviet and even
                    Chinese connivance.) As to South Vietnamese cross-border operations against
                    communist sanctuaries in Cambodia, that should be encouraged but without any US
                    involvement, for we must do all possible to support the case for Cambodia's
                    neutrality and territorial integrity.</p>
                <p>My memo was ignored/rejected by the White House. Haig, in fact, urged US
                    intervention, and the President, and then Kissinger (somewhat reluctantly),
                    agreed.</p>
                <p>At about this time (early April 1970), differences arose within the State
                    Department over the issue of US military weapons assistance to Cambodia. All of
                    us were opposed to US force involvement, but Bill Sullivan (my deputy who was
                    also chairman of the Interagency Task Force on Vietnam) favored sizeable US arms
                    assistance to Cambodia, insisting that all such assistance had to be overt.
                    Concealment was both impossible and politically unacceptable. I argued that
                    Congress would never approve arms assistance to Cambodia, at least not on any
                    meaningful scale. Rogers supported Sullivan until he learned of how strong
                    Congress' opposition was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what could be done to deal with the build-up of
                        Vietnamese communist sanctuaries in Cambodia? After all, we were committed
                        to a policy of Vietnamization; yet it was going to be most difficult to
                        carry through successfully on that policy, if the communists could operate
                        increasingly from bases in Cambodia.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>GREEN: Well, I felt that rather than trying to arm and equip the Cambodians
                    (something Congress strongly opposed), we should encourage the South Vietnamese
                    to conduct raids against these sanctuaries in Cambodia. However, Ambassador
                    Bunker and General Abrams evidently sided with the White House in believing that
                    the South Vietnamese were unable to conduct successful raids against these
                    sanctuaries without strong US support. My reaction to that thesis was: well, if
                    that's so, then our Vietnamization program was a clear failure—and we will never
                    be able to get out of the Vietnam quagmire.</p>
                <p>It was at that point, around April 20, 1970, that Lon Nol sent Nixon a long
                    telegraphic request for weapons to defend Cambodia. The request far exceeded
                    levels which even the White House felt our Congress would support.</p>
                <p>So, at that point, Nixon evidently came up with a stratagem to gain strong
                    Congressional approval for the secret plan he had evidently been drawing up with
                    the approval of Bunker and Abrams (but completely behind the back of the State
                    Department, including Rogers). He sent Rogers on April 27 (I believe) to the
                    Hill to gain Senate support for a strong South Vietnamese attack against the
                    sanctuary areas in Cambodia. I accompanied Rogers.</p>
                <p>Rogers told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that we had just received a
                    request from Lon Nol for US military equipment. Senator Fulbright asked for
                    specifics about what kinds of weapons, and in what quantities.</p>
                <p>At Rogers' request, I then read out the list of specific requests. Fulbright
                    exploded: “Why that must amount to over half a billion dollars!” Then Rogers
                    said: “You tell them, Marshall, what we figure it all adds up to.”</p>
                <p>I told the Committee that it amounted to $1.4 billion.</p>
                <p>This shock treatment had its calculated effect. Said Senator Church (with the
                    nodding assent of his colleagues): “I have no objection to South Vietnamese
                    involvement in Cambodia. Cross-border operations are okay. Here, in fact, is a
                    good place to test the effectiveness of Vietnamization.” Said Senator Cooper:
                    “The President now has support for Vietnamization. Let's not destroy that.”</p>
                <p>Now, what Rogers didn't tell the Senators (evidently because Rogers didn't know)
                    was that the White House was not just seeking Congressional endorsement for
                    South Vietnamese attacks against the sanctuaries but also to have these attacks
                    supported by US ground forces. All this was, of course, to lower Rogers'
                    standing with Congress: either he knew and was artfully deceptive, or he didn't
                    know and was without influence.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you first learn of Nixon's decision to commit US
                        forces in the Cambodian incursion?</hi>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>GREEN: Let's see. I learned of it the day before the incursion was launched on
                    April 30. So that would be at the WASAG meeting on the morning of April 29. I
                    was astounded when Kissinger mentioned the President's decision to commit US
                    ground forces. When I registered my objections as State representative at that
                    meeting, Kissinger said the operation was already approved by the President. I
                    could see what a spot the decision put Rogers in with the SFRC.</p>
                <p>Rogers was subdued when I called him about the WASAG meeting. I gathered he had
                    just given his reluctant consent to this ill-advised operation.</p>
                <p>I was with Rogers in his hideaway office on the 7th floor of the State Department
                    late in the evening of April 30, listening to Nixon's announcement over TV of
                    his rationale for ordering the incursion including US ground forces. As Nixon
                    concluded his maudlin remarks about the US otherwise appearing as a “pitiful,
                    helpless giant,” Rogers snapped off the TV set, muttering, “The kids are going
                    to retch.” He clearly foresaw how the speech was going to inflame the campuses.
                    That was several days before Kent State.</p>

                <p>GREEN: Shortly after the President's TV performance, there were several of
                    Kissinger's staff who resigned in protest. Less spectacular was the letter of
                    protest signed by 200 in the State Department, including 50 FSO's. However, not
                    a single member of my bureau (EA) was among the signers, for which reason Rogers
                    rewarded me by naming me chairman of a new special group on Southeast Asia,
                    which held weekly meetings for the next 18 months, and submitted analyses and
                    recommendations to the Secretary of State. It had little influence with the
                    White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Returning to the morning of May 1, 1970—the day of the
                        incursion, what, in fact, was the State Department's responsibilities in
                        supporting the President's decision?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: As usual, in such situations, we in State, responsive to White House
                    direction, immediately set about the task of giving diplomatic, VOA and other PR
                    support to the President's decision (including explanations to Lon Nol why he
                    was not consulted on the incursion). As a May 9 WASAG meeting in the White House
                    basement concluded, Nixon wandered in and took an empty seat next to mine at
                    HAK's conference table. He turned to me and said something to the effect that,
                    whereas I had opposed the incursion, he appreciated the fact that I loyally
                    carried out the President's decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that a compliment or a threat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Probably both. All during May, I was the leading State Department briefer
                    on events leading up to, and justifying, the incursion. I had to put up with
                    some heckling in the State Department auditorium, but, by and large, the
                    briefings went well, since we were assisted by a lot of “factual” information
                    supplied by our intelligence regarding enemy losses of ammo dumps and the like
                    in sanctuary areas. But the Senate, especially the SFRC, reflecting the angry
                    mood of the media and campuses, finally passed the Cooper-Church amendment on
                    June 30. By then, a reluctant Nixon had already ordered the withdrawal of US
                    forces from Cambodia. I suspect Rogers had some influence on that decision.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Alex Johnson under White House pressure, had set up an informal group
                    of legal and pol-mil advisers to figure out ways in which the US could most
                    effectively provide aid to Cambodia in the face of all the legal restrictions
                    now in force. Tom Pickering proved to be the most effective member of this group
                    which abided by the letter, but not the spirit, of Congressional
                    restrictions.</p>
                <p>From May onward, two of my particular headaches (which put me at odds with HAK
                    and Haig) were: (1) White House efforts to involve Southeast Asian countries,
                    especially Indonesia, in support of the Cambodian military; and (2) Al Haig's
                    missions to Phnom Penh.</p>
                <p>With regard to (1), the White House tried to supplement the paltry $7.9 million
                    MAP program for Cambodia, established by presidential determination on May 21,
                    through Indonesia and Thailand providing Cambodia with some of their MAP-funded
                    equipment. However, the White House refused to face up to the fact that, under
                    law, such transfers would have to be paid out of Cambodian MAP funds. The State
                    Department was committed to report to Congress all such MAP transfers by
                    September 30, 1970, and periodically thereafter.</p>
                <p>The issue was further complicated in the case of Indonesia by how these White
                    House pressures were creating some serious internal political problems within
                    Suharto's government.</p>
                <p>At some juncture, I can't recall the date, Kissinger, before leaving Washington
                    for the weekend, left with me a request to send a priority telegram to
                    Ambassador Swank in Phnom Penh instructing him to seek Lon Nol's approval for
                    (a) Indonesian military teams to provide field training for FANK, and (b) Thai
                    AF planes to deliver supplies by air to FANK field forces. In carrying out HAK's
                    request, I included a sentence in the telegram to the effect that it was only
                    fair to point out to Lon Nol that costs for such Indonesian and Thai support
                    were chargeable to Cambodian MAP funds. Lon Nol rejected the proposal
                    out-of-hand. HAK was furious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I can see why he was, but you, as a State Department
                        official had to answer to Congress on all these matters.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>GREEN: Yes. Moreover, it was not just a question of being honest and avoiding
                    serious misunderstandings, but also a question of how such Indonesian and Thai
                    involvement would spread the poison of Cambodia into other parts of Southeast
                    Asia. Clearly our sights had to be set on damage control.</p>
                <p>Earlier I mentioned Al Haig's missions to Phnom Penh as being my second biggest
                    headache. I tried unsuccessfully to have a State Department Cambodian specialist
                    accompany Haig on his trips to Phnom Penh. I received only the skimpiest of oral
                    reports form Haig about his trips, which left Mike Rives upset because he was
                    excluded from Haig's meetings with Lon Nol. A more fundamental objection to
                    Haig's missions was the way he was deliberately undercutting Rives and, after
                    November 1970, Coby Swank. He arranged to establish an exclusive CIA channel
                    between himself and Tom Enders, Swank's deputy, who was considered to be more
                    activist and gung-ho (like Haig). From then on, it was Haig who was running the
                    “sideshow,” step-by-step building up our defense assistance team, replacing Fred
                    Ladd (the sensible military adviser Alex Johnson had originally selected) with
                    the loud-mouth bumptious General Mataxis, and generally undercutting any
                    credible Cambodian claims to being neutral. Spiro Agnew's trip to Phnom Penh in
                    late July 1970 was a PR disaster, with photos in the world press showing Agnew
                    escorted by highly visible machine-gun toting SS men. Rives' efforts to get
                    these men not to display weapons so openly resulted in Rives being fired from
                    his job. Haig had been spoiling for an opportunity to have Rives removed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you visit Phnom Penh during the period 1970-71?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, twice. My first visit was in early July 1970, accompanied by my wife.
                    We were traveling with Secretary Rogers, but for some reason he decided to stay
                    in Saigon and sent us on to Phnom Penh for three days before rejoining his party
                    in Saigon. Lisa and I stayed with Mike Rives. He had only a few officers on his
                    staff at that time. In fact, he had no chauffeur, so that when he took us to the
                    Paris Restaurant (excellent cuisine) the first evening, he drove the limousine
                    separated from Lisa and me by the glass partition. (It's funny how little
                    details like that remain fixed in one's memory.) Another thing I remember about
                    this visit, which was the first of any Washington official during that period,
                    was the good conversations in French that Mike Rives and I had with Lon Nol and
                    Sirik Matak. Of the two, Sirik Matak was more impressive with his considerable
                    experience in diplomacy (Japan and the Philippines) and with his command of
                    governmental operations, for he was in real charge of the Cabinet, just as Lon
                    Nol was of the FANK.</p>
                <p>I had good, detailed briefings by Mike Rives, Fred Ladd, Andy Antippas and others
                    in the small mission.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>They had mixed feelings about the foreign press corps and the visits of US
                    congressmen and other VIPs. The views of such visitors tend to be too assertive,
                    hawkish and optimistic. The visitors seemed to be surprised how much better
                    things looked in Phnom Penh than they had been led to believe. In fact, one
                    group of five House members I met in Phnom Penh were irritated with the State
                    Department for being so cautious about their visiting Cambodia.</p>
                <p>It was clear to me that Mike Rives had his problems with the foreign press whose
                    numbers had dwindled from 100 in May down to 40 while I was there. These
                    problems seemed to be related to Mike's shyness and unfamiliarity with how to
                    handle the press. Mike also needed an experienced administrative officer who
                    spoke French.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, Mike was highly knowledgeable, hard-working and courageous. He
                    clearly deserved far more appreciation for his accomplishments than he got from
                    Al Haig and the White House.</p>
                <p>Aside from my Embassy briefings, by far my most interesting conversation was with
                    French Ambassador Dauge, who had a wide range of information sources
                    (businessmen, missionaries, planters, government advisors). Dauge pointed out
                    that the North Vietnamese in Cambodia treated the populace discreetly, never
                    stealing, paying for their food and services, ever seeking good will and
                    honoring the name of Sihanouk which resonates well with the peasantry making up
                    85% of the Cambodian population. At the same time, the North Vietnamese have
                    made no real effort to set up political cells, relying for that purpose on the
                    Khmer Rouge, long opposed to Sihanouk.</p>
                <p>Dauge attached more importance to the Khmer Rouge than did any other official I
                    met in Cambodia. In his words: “Hanoi has been carefully training Cambodians in
                    Hanoi for the express purpose of supporting the Khmer Rouge against Sihanouk,
                    eventually bringing Cambodia under North Vietnamese domination.” (Quoted from my
                    diary.) Dauge continued: “These Khmer Rouge, unlike the North Vietnamese, are
                    not making the pro-Sihanouk pitch that the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces
                    are making in Cambodia.” It is a “curious dichotomy” he concluded, “though I
                    feel that Sihanouk has no future in Cambodia,” one reason being Sihanouk's
                    turning to China rather than to North Vietnam.</p>
                <p>I mention the foregoing in some detail because, quite frankly, I did not
                    comprehend then, or for some time thereafter, the importance of the Khmer Rouge,
                    or who they were or what were their goals. I guess I had them confused with the
                    Khmer Krom, the Khmer Serei and the Khmer Communists. They were not conventional
                    communists but rather extreme zealots out to remake the whole nation in the
                    bloodiest manner.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>At the time of this July 1970 visit, there was a strong nationalistic upsurge,
                    with young Cambodians flocking to the colors. Phnom Penh was spotlessly clean
                    and superficially peaceful, though ancient Khmer-Tonkinese hatreds boded ill and
                    there were thousands of Vietnamese refugees crowded into holding areas along the
                    Bassac River banks. Atrocities against Vietnamese refugees were widely reported,
                    as were Vietnamese atrocities against Cambodians.</p>
                <p>I was well aware that the FANK was no match for the well trained and armed North
                    Vietnamese and that the best we could hope for was to keep as much of Cambodia
                    out of North Vietnamese control as possible and to retain as much of Cambodia's
                    spirit of nationalism and appearances of neutrality as possible. In any case, we
                    had to live with the realities of strong Congressional and public opposition to
                    the US getting further involved in Cambodia.</p>
                <p>Flying back to Saigon, Lisa and I rejoined Secretary Rogers' party headed for the
                    Far East Chiefs of Mission Conference in Tokyo which I chaired. Since there were
                    no US representatives from Cambodia at the conference, it became my
                    responsibility to provide the overall assessment of prospects in Cambodia. The
                    record of that meeting has me concluding that, “Cambodia faces a tenacious and
                    resourceful enemy, a collapsing economy and insufficient outside assistance.”
                    However, these are somewhat offset by “true nationalism, Buddhist antipathy
                    toward the atheist aggressors, and a countryside generally hostile to the North
                    Vietnamese and their puppet Sihanouk...”</p>
                <p>When I visited Phnom Penh in May 1971, in the company of Jack Irwin and Bill
                    Sullivan, we were concerned, as we said in our report, “how the weight of
                    official Americans in Phnom Penh, both civilian and military, were helping to
                    suffocate Khmer nationalism and enthusiasm.” We recommended that the size of our
                    mission not exceed 100, that marginal programs be phased out, and that DOD
                    should consider waiving end-user check requirements in order to keep down the
                    numbers of Americans in Cambodia. By May 1971 a supplemental appropriations bill
                    provided for well over $200 million in both economic and military assistance for
                    Cambodia. Khmer leadership was more seasoned, having withstood many challenges.
                    However the leaders were less sanguine, more sober about prospects. Rather than
                    seeing victory in the offing as they had in 1970, they were gearing up for the
                    long haul, with FANK now 200,000 strong in comparison to 35,000 in 1970.</p>
                <p>Yet more and more of Cambodia was passing under NVN control so that only Phnom
                    Penh and the land corridors to Sihanoukville and to Thailand via Battambang were
                    relatively secure.</p>
                <p>It remained pretty much that way through my remaining time as Assistant
                    Secretary, with US bombers pounding away at NVN positions largely in eastern
                    Cambodia. The fate of Cambodia was now inexorably linked with the fate of
                    Vietnam. It might have been otherwise.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems to me that this whole tragic saga throws a lot of
                        light on personalities, as indeed all such crises do. First of all there is
                        the question of Nixon and Kissinger. Of the two, who would you say was the
                        more determined to go ahead with the US ground force involvement in the
                        Cambodian incursion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: I would say Nixon, because he had an absolute “thing” about being the
                    tough guy (like General Patton), especially so that the North Vietnamese would
                    not take us for granted and would eventually be willing to settle on a peaceful
                    solution. And, of course, Nixon had a lot of people in Saigon, both US and
                    Vietnamese, who agreed with that tactic, including Ambassador Bunker and General
                    Abrams.</p>
                <p>Kissinger, in order to solidify his standing with the President and to weaken
                    that of Rogers, was the President's willing accomplice in carrying out the
                    fateful decision. But I cannot see Kissinger as urging the president to make the
                    decision he did, for it brought Kissinger a lot of grief, as he must have known
                    it would. Shawcross' “Sideshow,” a best seller, is a blistering attack in the
                    Nixon-Kissinger policies toward Cambodia, with Shawcross' comments about
                    Kissinger being excessively unfair.</p>

                        of circumvention of Congress was being too clever by half.</hi>

                    shenanigans. You can't operate that way.</p>

                <p>GREEN: Coby just learned to live with the problem. It didn't affect his standing
                    with the State Department. On the other hand, Tom Enders was running risks by
                    his by-passing official channels in dealing directly with Al Haig. Tom Enders
                    has always been an ambitious officer, but he could see that, while events were
                    elevating his standing with the White House, they might have the opposite effect
                    with the State Department. I know, because Tom broke down at one point and
                    confessed to me how all these events were affecting his sense of duty toward the
                    Secretary of State. This was no play-acting performance. He was genuinely in
                    anguish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the role of the foreign service officer
                        when faced with carrying out a presidential decision with which he
                        disagrees. I recall there were several on Kissinger's staff, including one
                        FSO (Bill Watts), who resigned over the president's decision to commit US
                        ground forces in the Cambodian incursion of April 30, 1970.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Alex Johnson has as interesting passage on this subject in his book, The
                    Right Hand of Power. He points out that some 50 junior FSO's, none of whom
                    served in Southeast Asia, addressed “a protest letter” to the Secretary of State
                    over this decision. They were perfectly entitled to do this through the dissent
                    channel, so long as it remained private and confidential. But they naively
                    xeroxed multiple copies for a maximum number of signatures. Copies of this
                    letter reached the press. When Nixon found out about this, he ordered the
                    Secretary to fire all who signed. Rogers and Alex eventually calmed the
                    President down and none were fired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but to get back to those who did resign on
                        Kissinger's staff. How about you? After all you opposed the President. Did
                        you at any point consider resigning over his decision?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Yes, but then we FSO's are like our military—we carry out orders once
                    those orders are determined and issued. Moreover, in my case, I managed to stay
                    on to fight further battles over our Cambodian policy, at least insofar as
                    successfully opposing White House efforts to involve Thailand and Indonesia in
                    its losing proposition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that's a good place to stop, unless you had any
                        further involvement in Cambodia after 1973.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GREEN: Only in 1981 when I chaired the State Department's Advisory Panel on
                    Indo-Chinese Refugees. By that time, the war in Vietnam had ended disastrously,
                    although the disaster was even greater in Cambodia where Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge
                    was still visiting some of the worst horrors in modern history on his fellow
                    Cambodians, as well as on Vietnamese who were trying to flee from Vietnam
                    through Cambodia to Thailand.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>I surreptitiously spent a day in a part of westernmost Cambodia which was not
                    under Pol Pot's control. But all of that is covered in the report issued by our
                    Advisory Panel in 1981.</p>
