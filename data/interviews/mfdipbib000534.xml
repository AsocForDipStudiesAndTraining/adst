                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>

                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is August 20, 1993. This is an interview with James
                        O'Brien Howard on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and I am
                        Charles Stuart Kennedy. Jim, could we start off with a little about your
                        background ...when you were born, where you were born, a little about your
                        family and early upbringing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: I was born in Selma, Alabama, November 30, 1915. My family lived on a
                    general farm...cotton, cattle, soybeans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Soybeans even in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Not a major crop. Primarily for cattle feed and as a source of nitrogen
                    to build up the soil.</p>
                <p>There were three brothers and one sister. We boys all worked on the farm when we
                    had any free time. We had a cotton patch every summer to earn a little money and
                    strengthen our character. These were not good times on the farm. By the time I
                    got to college age the depression had hit, 1932. My dad said that he couldn't
                    send me to college because there just wasn't the money, although my older
                    brother had been to college. I borrowed money and got to college. Went to
                    Birmingham Southern College, which is a Methodist school which my father had
                    also gone to. It was a liberal arts school. In those days once you found a way
                    to work your way through college, you had to stay with it. So I got odd jobs,
                    some scholarship help and a bit of family help. I went summer and winter
                    sticking to the jobs. So in six years I had gotten an B.A., MA and Ph.D.
                    degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your field?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>HOWARD: My undergraduate was Liberal Arts, but my Masters was in Constitutional
                    Law and the Doctorate was in International Relations. I wrote on Elihu Root's
                    contributions to international judication. The Doctorate, by the way, was at the
                    University of Iowa which was a good, midwestern, solid institution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What attracted you to international affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Well, it was a long way from that farm and that cotton patch. My parents
                    were both college educated, which was rather strange for farm people in that
                    stage of our history. They were reasonably widely read and we would always have
                    the Methodist preacher in for dinner on Sunday and there was always a discussion
                    of national and to some extent international affairs. My dad served in the
                    Alabama State Legislature.</p>
                <p>I don't know if anyone has ever asked me that question, precisely. It just seemed
                    like an interesting field. I had a good professor under whom I wrote.</p>
                <p>I suppose the next question would be how I ended up in the Department of
                    Agriculture?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: This was 1939, when I finished. The New Deal in agriculture was
                    struggling to educate the local agricultural workers as to what the New Deal was
                    all about. Here was a revolutionary concept of controlling production, much more
                    farmer democracy in it.</p>
                <p>How do you go about this? Well, they took an interesting approach. They hired a
                    professor of philosophy from Harvard, a professor of business ethics, a man
                    named Carl Taeusch, to head it up. He had given up trying to teach Harvard
                    business ethics. They weren't interested. So he said, “Well, I'll join the
                    government and we'll regulate them.”</p>
                <p>So he came to Washington and began to recruit a staff to cover the whole range of
                    social sciences...agricultural economics, but also philosophy, sociology. He
                    wanted a political scientist. He had used as one of the teachers in the
                    conferences that he organized a man at the University of Iowa named Porter.
                    Porter had been successful at these conferences, so he got in touch with him. He
                    said, “Do you have a man who might fill this bill?” He said, “Well, I have a
                    chap named Howard with a farm background and he loves politics and mixing with
                    politicians. He might do you a good job.” So I went to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Washington in 1939. Was Henry Wallace still in
                        charge as Secretary of Agriculture?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>HOWARD: Very much so, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Henry Wallace at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Henry Wallace was highly respected. He was a visionary and he had
                    contributed much to the development of hybrid corn. He knew economics. We
                    thought he was a great person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of things were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Taeusch was organizing conferences of mostly three days. Let's say we go
                    to Iowa and the Agricultural Extension Service would have agreed to participate.
                    Taeusch would recruit a staff for a three day conference. In the mornings there
                    would be lectures and then in the afternoon the attending group would break up
                    into small groups for discussion. They would come back at the close of the day
                    and the discussion leaders would be a panel to question these speakers. The
                    speakers were as diverse as you would imagine. They were journalists,
                    philosophers, professors from academic institutions, leaders from government,
                    clergy.I remember an editorial writer from the Christian Science Monitor served
                    on one of them. Markham, I believe was his name. He couldn't believe that the
                    Department of Agriculture would recruit speakers, some of whom would be critical
                    of what the government was doing and given absolute freedom. He wrote a very
                    favorable letter to the Christian Science Monitor.</p>
                <p>We also were writing pamphlets to be used by farm leaders or agricultural leaders
                    in small group discussion. We were training people on how to organize and lead
                    discussions. I was responsible for the work in the Southern States. Believe you
                    me it was a wonderful experience for a young person just out of university.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of people were you recruiting? Farms are always
                        considered the most conservative of the population, but this was really a
                        time of revolution in the United States, particularly in the farming area.
                        Who were you talking to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Who were we talking to?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were working to develop leaders within the Southern
                        community.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>HOWARD: But the main organization through which we were working was the
                    Agricultural Extension Service. You may remember that you have the county agent,
                    the home demonstration agent in each county. This is a Federal-State
                    organization, quite independent of Washington, though they got considerable
                    Federal help. You found the headquarters in each Land Grant college and those
                    were the major people that we worked with. Some of them were quite receptive and
                    some of them were somewhat less so. But over a period of time we met with most
                    of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the war have any impact on the type of work you were
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: I continued for some bit of time to do this work, but the nature of the
                    conferences changed because with the actual war and food being important on the
                    world scene, the messages we tried to get over changed somewhat and became more
                    meaningful to these agricultural leaders out in the states. But they were quite
                    receptive to it once the war broke out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you first start getting involved in the
                        international side of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: There were two or three steps in there. I went down and talked briefly at
                    Duke University when all of the professors were coming to Washington. I got
                    drafted into the Army from down there in Duke. Went into the Army and served in
                    Hawaii writing pamphlets which explained what the war was all about for a couple
                    of years. I then came back and wrote speeches for the Secretary of
                    Agriculture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Clinton P. Anderson from New Mexico. Charlie Brandon was the Under
                    Secretary. When Truman was running against Dewey, I thought Truman was going to
                    lose and I had to get out of the Secretary's office because it was somewhat
                    political. I started looking around and went to the Foreign Agricultural
                    Service...then it was called the Office of Foreign Agricultural Relations,
                    OFAR...and talked to the Information Director, although I wasn't trained in
                    information, I had done speech writing. The head of the Information Division
                    said, “Jim, I don't have a job for you except my own. I am leaving to become the
                    head of FAO, the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization international division.
                    You can have my job.” And that is when I got into the foreign...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be about 1948?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: No. Truman's election was in 1948 so that would have been about 1949.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give a feel for what the type of work was like
                        that you were doing then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: The foreign work of the Department of Agricultural was very much in
                    transition at that time. The war is just over. Europe is in chaos. There is a
                    question of can we help feed Europe.</p>
                <p>Let me backtrack. When I was writing speeches for the Secretary's office, that
                    was the time the Marshall Plan was being debated. One of the key questions faced
                    by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which had the major role in this,
                    was, “Do we have enough food to do this job that General Marshall and President
                    Truman have proposed?”</p>
                <p>Clinton Anderson set up a committee of key people to study this question. I was
                    attached to that committee to be the scribe. There was some wonderful work done.
                    The net result was, “Yes, we do have enough food. We can do the job. We can feed
                    our people without sacrificing at home and do the job that Europe needs.”</p>
                <p>So I had the fun of writing the testimony which Clinton Anderson gave before
                    Senator Vandenberg, who was Chairman, then, of the Senate Foreign Relations
                    Committee. Anderson was a wonderful speaker. We had all sorts of charts. They
                    practically gave him the Pulitzer Prize. He was wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were doing this investigation, were you feeling
                        any pressure on you of the answer that was to come out, or were people
                        really looking at this dispassionately?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Well, you see, I was not a member of the committee, itself, I guess. I
                    was a writer. We obviously were biased to the extent we wanted to find that
                    there was enough food, but the committee...the committee was headed by a man
                    named O. V. Wells who was head of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and was
                    later Deputy Director of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. He was an
                    able, able economist. We had good statisticians. Had our analysis proven faulty,
                    we wouldn't have looked very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There would have been a lot of hungry, angry Americans
                        after you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at this with the Marshall Plan and all, and food,
                        of course, was a vital element of it, were you looking at ways of increasing
                        the amount of food we produced? Was this a factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>HOWARD: Let's back up in answering that question. After World War I, US
                    agriculture had faced a crisis. They had expanded to meet the war needs and they
                    figured that the market was going to retrench, so they had cut back very much on
                    production and we had an agricultural recession, which I vaguely recall was
                    quite costly.</p>
                <p>After World War II, they faced this same question. Secretary of Agriculture
                    Benson and President Eisenhower, along with the farm leaders in the Congress,
                    and the farm organizations like the American Farm Bureau Federation, said,
                    “Let's go the other way. Let's continue a high level of production and find ways
                    to sell it, particularly abroad. There are people abroad who need it.” That was
                    the gist of the new agricultural program. In fact, I helped write testimony
                    along that line while I was still in the Secretary's office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, we are back to the Office of Foreign Agriculture
                        Relations in 1949. The Marshall Plan is beginning to kick in and all that.
                        What were you doing, what was your office doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: My job was to run the information office of this little branch of the
                    Department of Agriculture. I had speech writers; and I wrote testimony,; we
                    published a regular monthly magazine called “Foreign Agriculture” which
                    consisted of developments in foreign agriculture; we published a weekly
                    mimeographed crops and markets which...</p>
                <p>Stu, the function, if I may backtrack for just a second, the function of OFAR in
                    those days was to collect worldwide agricultural information, collate it,
                    analyze it and get it up to the people who needed it in the US, not only farm
                    leaders, but business leaders. So the information division was a key part of
                    this process. Our technical people would write the pamphlets, draw up the tables
                    and we would get them out to the public.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation at the Department of Agriculture
                        ...I came into the Foreign Service in 1955, and at that time we had a full
                        blown agricultural attach� program where every major embassy and every
                        country with an important agricultural component to it, had an American
                        agricultural attach�. We are talking about 1949, the immediate post-war
                        period. What type of a system did we have at that time overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: It was infinitely smaller than when you came onto the scene. It went
                    through some revolutions, but about the time we are talking about, the
                    agricultural attach�s were not employed by the US Department of Agriculture. We
                    will get a little later into my first experience as an attach�. I had to be
                    seconded to the State Department. I went onto State Department rolls to go as
                    agricultural attach�. The Department of Agriculture reimbursed State. It wasn't
                    until about 1953 that the agricultural attach�s were taken out of the State
                    Department and made a separate arm of the Department of Agriculture.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you getting these reports that you were filtering
                        and transmitting again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Well, we had these agricultural attach�s covering the major agricultural
                    producing nations of the world and the agricultural markets of the world. We had
                    someone in Argentina, Brazil. We might have one man covering two or three of the
                    smaller countries of South America, or Europe. But in a place like London, which
                    was a major market for various agricultural products, and also a source of
                    international agricultural information...you had friends like Unilever, for
                    example, the fats and oil soap makers, they were a great source of information
                    for us too. So we always had a strong unit in London. We had a strong unit in
                    Germany. We had a strong organization in China, believe it or not. So they wrote
                    reports on a regular schedule. On such and such a date the quarterly wheat
                    report was due in. They came into Washington and were analyzed not only as to
                    what the world's production of wheat was going to be, but what was happening to
                    the world's market for wheat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Soviet Union and its Eastern European
                        countries? Was there a problem getting information? Was there an effort on
                        the part of the powers that be to make sure that we cast them in an
                        unfavorable light as possible?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Getting information was extremely difficult. We had put some of our best
                    people in Moscow. They were given good training, good language training. They
                    had to rely on their own resources, whereas when I went to my first post in
                    Portugal, I had a good Portuguese assistant. In Moscow you might have a Russian
                    assistant who might be doing translating for you, but you couldn't trust him.
                    You had to do your own analysis. Still you have to realize that in this vacuum
                    of world information, the analysis of the crops in Russia, done by the US
                    Department of Agriculture, were of worldwide importance. There were only two
                    basic sources of information. One was the FAO and the other was the US
                    Department of Agriculture. We thought ours was much better because we didn't
                    have to cater to the nation giving us the information.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: I am not the best source of information on this because I never served in
                    that part of the world, but we have always, and this became more important
                    perhaps in later years, had excellent relations with our intelligence community.
                    And I hasten to say that we made some contributions to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you doing this informational work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: About three years. I should tell you that I had a second function during
                    that period. Attached to the Information Division was the job of the liaison
                    with the international organizations...FAO being the principal one. So I was
                    also secretary to the US Committee on FAO and had two people on my staff who
                    worked full time on that. I went to all the early meetings of FAO and even after
                    they moved their headquarters to Rome, I continued to go and have a certificate
                    from Harry Truman appointing me as the permanent secretary to the US delegate to
                    the Council of the FAO. The Council was the small body that met twice a
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression at that time of the FAO? What it
                        was doing, how it was staffed, how good it was in what it was trying to
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Maybe I wasn't the most objective person, but here is a young PhD in
                    International Relations and here is the United Nations getting started. I was
                    emotionally very committed to it. But, from an objective standpoint, I thought
                    it was working pretty well. The US put a lot of resources into it...mostly
                    Agriculture, but State had the people and Interior had people in Fisheries. We
                    always had strong delegations. Though the first Director General was British, it
                    wasn't too many years before one of our leading scientists was Director General
                    of the FAO, ________Cardin [ph]. He was a personal friend of mine. He may not
                    have been the best Director General.</p>
                <p>But FAO was getting started. It was pulling together information. It was
                    beginning its technical assistance program. It carried a lot of goodwill from
                    all over the Western world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was FAO trying to do in those years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Intelligence and technical assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it pretty much the feeling that the United States was
                        preeminent in technical assistance in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: I wouldn't put it that way. But if you wanted an expert on livestock to
                    be sent to some developing country to advise on their livestock breeding
                    program, where would you look? You would look to not so many countries in the
                    world. The US was perhaps the best source for that sort of thing. So FAO did a
                    great deal of recruiting in this country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the contribution that other
                        countries were making towards the FAO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Surely, you are sitting in these conferences and you see it in two ways.
                    You see it in the budget and you see it in the support they give to the
                    technical committees and the quality of people. The Canadians, for example,
                    always had first rate people. The Brits had first rate people. I am sure a
                    number of the other European countries did. I don't think the Russians joined
                    FAO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are now moving towards the time when you are just
                        beginning to get out into the foreign affairs world. Around 1951 was your
                        first assignment abroad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: That sounds about right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have you going to Lisbon in 1951-53. How did that come
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: I had a theory that in this early period of my career, about three years
                    is as long as a job would contribute to my development so about every three
                    years I tried to move forward. Three years would give me time to make my
                    contribution and maybe level out in my contribution and be ready for the next
                    step in my career.</p>
                <p>So here I was running this information division and all these attach�s were
                    coming back. We had conferences and I knew a lot of them and was ready to go
                    out. My wife, who has always been a very strong party of this family in this
                    commission was willing to go too. We had two small children, but she said...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Portugal in 1951. What was the situation as
                        you saw it in Portugal at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>HOWARD: Portugal was not one of the developed countries of Europe. Salazar had
                    been dictator for a long, long time. The agriculture was not best developed, but
                    they had some good people. It was a good place for a young attach� to have his
                    first experience. I had first been assigned to Denmark and then the boss said,
                    “The Ambassador to Portugal is insisting that he needs someone, so we are going
                    to switch you.” But Denmark would have been a much more interesting
                    ___________________.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Portugal self-sustaining at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Portugal at that time, you have to remember, had some important African
                    colonies in Mozambique and Angola and some smaller ones in Asia. Trade with them
                    was important. They were drawing on Portugal for financial resources, though. As
                    I recall, Portugal was about self-sufficient. We sold them some wheat and cotton
                    and they exported olive oil and leaves. They were not a significant agricultural
                    exporter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do? What does an agricultural attach� do in
                        not a major country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Basic job is to write these reports commodity by commodity that go back
                    to Washington on a pre=determined schedule and are used to write these regional
                    and world reports. So I had a calendar of reporting dates. On such and such a
                    date I have to have a report on the Portuguese olive crop in Washington. And it
                    isn't always easy. Where do you get your information?</p>
                <p>Again I have to mention this Portuguese assistant—Dominicus Aspirtus Santo [ph].
                    He had been over here a few years as a young man and spoke and wrote pretty good
                    English. So he would help me. In those days you didn't get much language
                    training. I had five weeks of Portuguese at the Foreign Service Institute before
                    leaving. But I hired a tutor to come in at the lunch hour and tutor me. I became
                    reasonably proficient, not great.</p>
                <p>We would use published information, go to the olive oil institute; go to that
                    branch of the Ministry of Agriculture dealing with that industry. Part of my job
                    was to cultivate those people so that they were willing to cooperate. That was
                    sometimes easy and sometimes not so.</p>
                <p>Then you would find that the figures didn't balance. Portugal had more olive oil
                    than the total of its production minus exports. Why? I dug into it and found
                    that olive oil was being smuggled across the border from Spain because it was a
                    better price than Portugal and that was where the disparity was coming from.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impression of the Salazar government? You
                        were part of the Embassy team. How did they feel about Salazar in those
                        days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: In those days as now we believe in democracy and that they did not have.
                    But he was a benign dictator. He was a professor of economics, finance, at the
                    university when he was recruited for this job. His sole means of staying in
                    power was his threat to resign. “If you don't like what I do, I will go back to
                    the university.” They had had so much chaos before he came, that they said, “No,
                    no, please stay.” And he stayed for 25 to 30 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was running our Embassy in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Let me think. One of the Ambassadors I had there was Guggenheim,
                    Anacostia Copper. He was a pure political appointment. All he had ever done in
                    life was clip coupons and contribute to the Republican Party. His wife, Polly,
                    was a delightful person.</p>
                <p>I remember my first cocktail party. We had just moved into this house after
                    living in a hotel for two months with two small children. So we had to have a
                    cocktail party. We invited the list of people important to the office. The
                    Ambassador had graciously agreed to be there. My wife and I were a bit nervous.
                    The Ambassador came after the party was going a bit, and we greeted him and
                    asked him what he would have. He said, “I would like a martini.” I summoned the
                    waiter we had hired and said, “Do you know how to make a martini?” “Si, si,
                    senor.” The Ambassador said, “But I want three gin and one vermouth.” I asked if
                    he understood and he said, “Si, si.” I said, “Tres gin and un vermouth.” “Si,
                    senor.”</p>
                <p>I went on with my greetings and pretty soon Ambassador Guggenheim pulled my
                    coattail and I turned around and here was the waiter in front of the Ambassador
                    holding a tray with three glasses of gin and one of vermouth. The Ambassador
                    said, “That is all right dear, go ahead and drink it and we will shake you and
                    get the same effect.”</p>
                <p>Cavendish Cannon had just been there as Ambassador. Then he went to Spain. He was
                    a career Ambassador.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: He retired just down the street from where we are living. He had a
                    wonderful reputation.</p>
                <p>There was another Ambassador who followed Guggenheim, but I'll think of that
                    later. [note from transcriber: James C. H. Bonbright followed Guggenheim.]</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>There were always excellent number two people who ran the Embassy. And we had a
                    good Economic Counselor, who was my major boss.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An agricultural expert comes from a completely different
                        background than most Foreign Service officers. How did you find
                        professionally you were used at the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Stu, this is not an easy situation and some agricultural attach�s had
                    difficulties. I did not. You have two bosses. I am the agricultural person on
                    the Ambassador's staff and do whatever he asks of me. But my real boss, my more
                    important boss, is the Secretary of Agriculture, who through OFAR is sending
                    these requirements that I do this reporting. So you have to be careful. But with
                    career ambassadors who know the situation, know what my job is...they have
                    commercial attach�s doing similar reporting...it was not difficult. In some
                    posts I was of considerable use to the Ambassador.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in Portugal did we have any agricultural

                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: No. My job was more getting them to cooperate with us in international
                    forums where we were maybe attacking the Europeans on some of their food and
                    drug regulations that were discriminating against our crops. Or we would work
                    with the Portuguese in getting a common position in FAO conferences. But we
                    didn't have any serious debates with them like we have had with some other
                    countries.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: I was there for nineteen months. The reason I left so soon...you know you
                    want your first post to be as long as you can get it so that you can get a
                    reputation ...but the State Department at that time had one of the biggest
                    budget cuts it had ever had. They told Agriculture that they had to cut out a
                    number of attach� posts.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: The boss who was running OFAR was a close personal friend by this time.
                    His name was Fred Rossiter. I wrote him and said, “Fred, I know the pressures
                    you are under to cut posts. I have trained a good local assistant here and I
                    think we could do without an American here for a year or two without great lost.
                    So if you want to bring me home I think it would not create a big problem.” I
                    had been the first attach� in Portugal. He accepted by return mail. It was one
                    of the cruelest things I ever did to my family because the wife and two children
                    had just gotten settled in and were loving it and we got pulled home after
                    nineteen months.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back to Washington to do what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: I was back from 1953-55. Some important changes had taken place in my
                    base organization by this time. When Eisenhower came in there was this question
                    of what the agricultural policy should be..should we continue production? One of
                    the major means of getting rid of these surpluses which were developing was PL
                    480, the Agricultural Trade and Development Act of 1954. This was a major piece
                    of legislation, not only in agriculture but in the foreign affairs community
                    because it said that we can sell these surpluses to a country that has balance
                    of payments difficulties and they don't have to pay for them with convertible
                    currency. They can pay for them with blocked currency, which we have to spend in
                    that country.</p>
                <p>So the question then was, we are going to have blocked currency in many countries
                    in the world, what do we do with it? Congress in considering this and
                    Agriculture considering this made a long list of things. One of them was to
                    develop new markets for US agricultural commodities on a mutually benefitting
                    basis. They took this draft legislature over to the Under Secretary of
                    Agriculture, John Davis. John studied it and took that one use and moved it up
                    to the first and it became the genesis of a new program in the Department of
                    Agriculture...to develop foreign markets.We had money now.</p>
                <p>About that same time, 1953, I think it was, Congress had voted to move the
                    agricultural attach�s out of the State Department and make them direct employees
                    of the Department of Agriculture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any idea of the genesis behind this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Yes, I was hoping you would give me a chance to tell this story.</p>
                <p>This was something that Agriculture had long wanted and State, for fairly
                    obviously reasons, had not wanted. They wanted to be a unified Foreign Service
                    entity. Our people were pushing hard for it and with all this genesis of these
                    programs I am telling you about...there were stronger reasons for it.</p>
                <p>John Davis went over to President Eisenhower. Secretary Dulles was out of the
                    city so Ike called Bedell Smith in. This is the way John Davis told me this
                    story. John Davis explained that we wanted these men under our own control. He
                    said, “Mr. President, it is just like your military attach�s. You wouldn't want
                    them controlled by the State Department, would you?” And Ike said, “Bedell, that
                    makes sense doesn't it?” Bedell said, “Yes, it does.” And that is how it
                    happened. If Dulles had been in town that never would have happened.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is always one of the great ploys, to make your move
                        when your principal opponent is out of town. So you now had a full blown
                        attach� service in the Department of Agriculture.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: We had a new legislative charter and a new name. It became the Foreign
                    Agricultural Service. This happened in 1953/54. I came back just as this process
                    was starting and was put into the Cotton Division as the Deputy Director. Of
                    course I grew up on a cotton farm in Alabama.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we doing in cotton?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: This is the most important world fiber. Cotton is important to a lot of
                    parts of the world. The intelligence on it is important. Also, we had had from
                    the triple A days, Agricultural Adjustment Administration, control of cotton
                    acreage. You had a lot of politics. Stu, if you know politics, you know the
                    Southern politicians could be the most political of all because the Senators
                    would stay in there a life time. So cotton was highly political and it was
                    important. It had some good leadership down in the cotton belt. Some of them had
                    gotten together and organized the National Cotton Council, which consisted of
                    cotton farmers, cotton spinners, cotton ginners, the oil seed crushers...there
                    were about five sectors of this that came together to form this organization to
                    push cotton legislation, cotton markets. They had just gotten active in the
                    international scene. So I was working with them...a man named Reed Dunn, who had
                    been a life long friend. That was a fun sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Let me backup a little here. In 1953 I had just gotten back from Portugal and
                    assigned to this position but hadn't really gotten started when the farm leaders
                    talked President Eisenhower into sending, organizing four missions of
                    nongovernmental leaders in the agricultural field, to send to four parts of the
                    world to study the potential markets for agricultural products. They would be
                    all nongovernmental except one. There had to be somebody from the government to
                    be the liaison with the embassy and see that arrangements were made. And they
                    said, “Here is Howard. He has had government experience.” So I was made the
                    Executive Secretary of this group to Southern Europe.</p>
                <p>It was a find group, an able group of people headed by Jack Hudson, who was then
                    with the Tobacco Institute, but who had been Assistant Secretary of Agriculture
                    and Under Secretary of the UN. He was a very able man. And there was a cotton
                    person on it and a wheat person. The cotton person on it was the person who was
                    head of the Cotton Council, so when I began to work in that division I had a
                    friend. His name was Ray Blake. We worked together very harmoniously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the international field, do we have great rivals in
                        cotton anywhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>HOWARD: Oh, yes. Among the major cotton producers of the world are Egypt, which
                    produces a very fine long staple cotton, and India, which produces a very short
                    staple cotton. But it is produced widely over the world ...Pakistan, South
                    America, Central America. So there had been organized an International Cotton
                    Advisory Committee, which was a intergovernmental organization of these
                    producing and major consuming countries, like the British, etc. One of my
                    functions was to work with this intergovernmental organization in pulling
                    together intelligence and sharing information about expanding markets and that
                    sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got this information, did we act on it or was
                        this mainly passed on to the cotton exporters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: First it went into the mill to decide how much cotton acreage shall be
                    allowed next year. The amount of cotton acreage depends on part on the market
                    outlook and how much surplus various nations are holding. So it was used very
                    importantly by the US Department of Agriculture and the agricultural committees
                    of Congress, as well as by the trade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the foreign policy side, were we trying to stop the
                        Indians or Egyptians who were overproducing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Yes, of course we would through normal diplomatic means. But we didn't
                    have any arm-twisting techniques that I particularly recall now. We would not
                    only go directly through our embassy or through the Department here working the
                    Agricultural Counselor from Egypt, etc., but we would also use this
                    International Cotton Advisory Committee. And the Cotton Council would be over
                    there working with the cotton spinners of England, to influence them. The Sudan
                    was another big cotton producer. They had a million acres under one management.
                    It was flat as a table. We used all the normal tools of diplomacy to influence
                    these things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any major problems during this time you were
                        dealing with the cotton situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: A major problem was over production, the surpluses that were depressing
                    the price. The US had put a floor under its price guaranteeing American farmers
                    a set price. Under these circumstances what would you do if you were running the
                    cotton program in Colombia? You would drop down just a couple of cents
                    underneath that and you would begin to take the market. We had that sort of
                    thing all over the world and it was tough.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How are most of the negotiations trying to make favorable
                        agreement done? With the Department of Agriculture or is the information
                        handed over to the State Department which would be the principle
                        negotiator?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: It was done mostly through this International Cotton Advisory Committee,
                    this intergovernmental organization, but which the trade was also very active
                    in. Our delegation would be headed by a government person. Someone from the
                    Department of Agriculture, someone from State would be on the delegation. And
                    the Cotton Council people would be there. We would meet in various cotton
                    producing or consuming countries of the world. As I recall we met every other
                    year in plenary session. That is where we would have some tough negotiations.
                    There again, you see, you have to agree on figures. I remember at one interim
                    meeting in the Department of Agriculture, the Japanese said, “Your figures on
                    our cotton consumption is just wrong. It is not that high.” So my boss, who was
                    head of that division said to me, “Jim, go back and get so-and-so to bring in
                    such-and-such table.” So I rushed back and got the table. My boss, Dr. Palmer,
                    handed it to the Japanese representative and he blushed and said, “I am sorry,
                    but those are our figures.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I notice you mention two of our great rivals in cotton
                        were Egypt and India. It is no secret that at that particular time our
                        foreign policy was very heavily influenced by the Secretary of State, who
                        was John Foster Dulles. On a personality basis, Nehru and Nasser were
                        probably two of his least favored people in the world. Did this have any
                        effect at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: It certainly affected my next assignment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course it did, but at this time did you see any

                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: The agricultural counselor from Egypt who was here was an able man and
                    easy to communicate with, but our interests were different. They wanted to
                    produced as much as they could and they wanted us to be the residual holder of
                    the world. So we weren't on the same wave length. But I don't remember this
                    national politics being a significant factor in it. But it could have been. I
                    was just a junior officer then.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We then move to your next one where the Nasser/Dulles
                        relationship becomes more important. You went to Cairo from 1955-57. How did

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>HOWARD: It was a rather natural one. Again I had been in Washington, not quite
                    three years, but quite a bit. I had enjoyed my first agricultural attach�
                    assignment and my wife was quite willing to go. Since I had been in the Cotton
                    Division, this was one of the world's major cotton producers, it was rather a
                    logical assignment as soon as I said I was willing to go abroad. In fact I had
                    been asked to go to Spain, but I felt I was so new in the Cotton Division that
                    it might look bad for FAS to pull me out. So they left me there for a few months
                    and I was then told I would be going to Egypt.</p>
                <p>A small personal note. Remember I had written speeches for a Democratic Secretary
                    of Agriculture. That made the Eisenhower group look at me with some suspicion, I
                    suppose. So they held up my security clearance. We were on tenterhooks there for
                    a while, but I think the thing that convinced them that I wasn't so bad,
                    was...as I mentioned the subject of my Doctoral had been Elihu Root, who had
                    served in the Roosevelt Cabinet as Secretary of War and Secretary of State. A
                    good solid Republican. So they decided to let me go ahead and go to Egypt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were out there in 1955. This 1955-56 period was a
                        very, very interesting period. What was your impression of not just the
                        agricultural side, but the situation in Egypt when you got out there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Stu, I served in a number of countries and traveled fairly widely and
                    this was one place where I always felt like a foreigner. You just never felt you
                    were in a friendly environment. Remember that Egypt had been ruled so long by
                    the Turks and then the Brits. It had been so long since they had a period that
                    they could feel proud of...3,000 years. They were suspicious of Westerners in
                    general, to start with. Not us more than others.</p>
                <p>In the beginning, remember Nasser had decided that he must build the Aswan Dam
                    and bring another 23 odd million acres under cultivation to provide for his
                    expanding population. It was one of the most rapidly growing populations of the
                    world at that time. So he was looking for financing on this high dam. Secretary
                    of Dulles was giving him some encouragement that we would help. He was playing
                    the Russians at the same time that he was playing us. So it wasn't the most
                    comfortable diplomatic situation to be in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time what were we thinking would be the result of
                        the Aswan Dam, which was a major key to a lot of things that happened later
                        on. Would it help Egypt or would the long term outcome be disastrous? What
                        were we thinking at that time?</hi>

                <p>HOWARD: I don't recall what the US government was thinking, but I remember doing
                    an analysis of my own. I think they were going to increase the productive
                    acreage of the country about 25 percent and it was going to take seven years to
                    build. I took the population growth and projected it for that seven years and
                    came out with the figure that they would have no more land per capita when they
                    finished than they did when they started. I don't know what that added up to,
                    but their population growth was a major factor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern that by stopping the flow you would (1)
                        end up with a lot of silt behind the dam and (2) this silt played an
                        important role in making the banks of the Nile fertile and if stopped would
                        have an effect on agriculture? Were we looking at it in that way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: They were going to have a means of opening the gates and letting the
                    power of the river wash on down when the river was at major flood. I can only
                    remember that it was a controversial issue, but from the Egyptian standpoint it
                    made sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working with Egyptian officials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Sticky. I don't know if it was my responsibility but we pulled a coup by
                    hiring as a local assistant in my office a son of the Under Secretary of
                    Agriculture, Mohammed Dessouky. That meant that the Minister of Agriculture had
                    an open channel into my office, but it also meant that I had good cooperation
                    from some branches of the Ministry in getting figures. As far as we were concern
                    it was a very good trade-off. Mohammed Dessouky wrote good English. He would get
                    the facts. I had an American assistant there at that time, too. We would work it
                    over and put in our own input. But we got good data out of the Ministry of
                    Agriculture and we were able to do reports that were highly regarded as I recall
                    back in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any agricultural disputes with Egypt at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Yes. A digression. The Chairman of the Agricultural Appropriations
                    Subcommittee of the House Appropriation Committee was a gentleman named Jamie
                    Whitten, a Congressman from Mississippi. He just gave up that job a couple of
                    years ago. I think he held that job for three or four decades. Jamie Whitten was
                    absolutely adamant that we do nothing which would help cotton production in
                    Egypt. In another building of the Embassy was AID, the Agency for International
                    Development. They had a good staff there. And they had an agricultural person.
                    Well now, this defies reason that you are going to give technical assistance to
                    Egyptian agriculture and it is not one way or another going to help cotton.
                    Whatever you are working on is likely to have implications for cotton. This
                    created many awkward situations that I would get involved in to some extent with
                    the Ambassador and the agricultural person from the AID mission.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Hank Byroade and Raymond Hare were the two Ambassadors I served under
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Hare was a career man. Byroade I never felt comfortable with, or felt
                    close too. He was a military man and apparently a very able man. But he wasn't
                    interested in agriculture, so I did my thing and he never got in my way. I went
                    with him to see Nasser about something on a ceremonial occasion. But didn't see
                    a lot of him.</p>
                <p>Pete Hart was the Deputy Chief of Mission.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the nationalization of the Suez Canal affect our
                        Embassy and you in particular?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: It affected the Embassy dramatically and I need a stronger word for what
                    it did to my work, because my job involved travel. I was heading a regional
                    office that covered Syria, Lebanon, the Sudan and Egypt. I had a part time local
                    assistant in Syria and another one in Lebanon. I had a full time American
                    assistant in Cairo. He and I covered Egypt and the Sudan by travel. With the
                    nationalization, bingo, no more travel. No travel out of Cairo. No travel down
                    to the delta of Egypt. How can an intelligence gathering office like ours work
                    without being able to get out? Mohammed Dessouky could get out and my local
                    assistants in the other countries could. But it made a tremendous
                    difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the reason for not allowing travel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Personal security. Afraid that the antagonism to...you couldn't tell from
                    my looks whether I was an American, an Australian or a Brit, and it just wasn't
                    safe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move from this period, you mentioned that you
                        were doing regional work. What was the situation in the Sudan? Was the Sudan
                        at that time still under British rule?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: The Sudan became independent during this time. The American Ambassador
                    was a man named Lowell Pinkerton. He had been an inspector, in fact he had
                    inspected Portugal while Guggenheim was the Ambassador there.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he find it in Portugal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: He came to dinner in my home in Cairo as he was going to Khartoum. It was
                    just he, my wife and I. I said, “Mr. Ambassador is it true that Ambassador
                    Guggenheim dropped a spoon down the bosom of the wife of the Portuguese Foreign
                    Minister?” He said, “Jim, he not only dropped it, he went in after it.” So when
                    Guggenheim was brought back for consultation and returned to Lisbon, he said,
                    “He didn't bring me back for consultation, he brought me back to fire me.”</p>
                <p>Anyway, Pinkerton was an able person. He invited me down to Khartoum to stand up
                    with him when he presented his credentials. If I may take a moment, there
                    weren't very many people there who could record this story. The Sudanese
                    government sent a car for each member of Pinkerton's party. There were four of
                    us. I was the junior, the fourth. They sent a red Ford station wagon. In it was
                    a member of the Foreign Office, who turned out to be the number two man in the
                    Foreign Office. I said to myself, “This speaks well of the Sudanese. They
                    respect the importance of agriculture enough to assign a man of this level to be
                    my escort.” As we chatted I said, “By the way, how many people do you have in
                    the Foreign Office?” “Two.”</p>
                <p>The Sudan in those days was fascinating to a young curious person like myself.
                    You go into the Ministry of Agriculture and they would have four or five
                    departments. Each one was headed by a trained professional. These trained
                    professionals were generally able people. Let's say we were talking about the
                    production aids to the cotton department. If you got below that man all you got
                    were clerks. The Brits had educated enough that they had half a dozen or so
                    people in the Ministry of Agriculture, each heading these units, who were very
                    able. But below that there were just clerks who were of no help whatsoever.
                    Those that were educated were cooperative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Sudan was supposed to be the cream of the crop as far
                        as the British were concerned. They sent their best people there and felt
                        they were doing their best there. The Sudanese Colonial Service had quite a
                        reputation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Yes, and I know nothing to argue with that except in the field of
                    agriculture it was infinitely too limited.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any particular problems with the Sudan,

                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>HOWARD: No. But I would like to contribute two stories. I mentioned this billion
                    acre cotton plantation which was called the Gezira Scheme. We spoke of it as the
                    Gezira Plantation. It was created by British textile interests. I wouldn't say
                    when, but it probably was encouraged by our Civil War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your kin made the calculation that cotton was king and if
                        they held out the cotton the British would have to come in, and it didn't
                        work. It was called Egyptian cotton in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Well, I am not sure how that date tied in with the start of the Gezira
                    scheme. I suspect it was somewhat later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was because the British, the Egyptians lost
                        control at the turn of the century.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: When Mahdi defeated Kitchener and slew Gordon.</p>
                <p>This plantation was well conceived, well engineered. It had been run by British
                    technicians using an underlayer of Sudanese. Now Sudan was becoming independent
                    and this would affect the Gezira Plantation. I don't know exactly when, but by
                    the time I got there, there was already a Sudanese director. He hadn't been
                    director very long, but I recall the man. His name was Mickey Abass. A big,
                    black, fine looking human being. Well-spoken. He had come up from the ranks and
                    the Brits had taken an interest in him and sent him back to England for an
                    education. He married a white, Scottish MD.</p>
                <p>I was traveling over there with a journalist from the Saturday Evening Post named
                    John Bird. John Bird and I were entertained by Mickey Abass and his wife. I
                    recall flying in there in a small two-seatter plane. The captain took us around
                    and let us see it. It was amazing. It was beautiful and functional. They were at
                    that time in the process of creating another dam to expand this area quite
                    appreciably. I think it finally went through, but I haven't followed it. Okay,
                    that was one story I wanted to tell you.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Henry Cabot Lodge was our US Representative to the UN at the time. Lodge and his
                    wife came down to be present at the presenting of credentials, or just after, to
                    welcome the Sudan into the UN on behalf of the US, obviously playing national
                    politics. The new Foreign Minister entertained him nicely. They had a dinner
                    which was given in the night club in Khartoum. The night club was a structure
                    with a dirt floor and grapevines over the arbor to keep the sun out. There were
                    card table like tables around. We were all sitting there and they served the
                    dinner. There are two things I recall. One was the ease with which Lodge moved
                    from table to table ingratiating himself and chatting with all these people. The
                    other was the Press Officer for the Sudanese government, who I found had served
                    in Brazil and spoke Portuguese. He and I were talking in Portuguese and in
                    English. He was in charge of keeping people's glasses filled as the Foreign
                    Minister went around saying, “Fill up peoples glasses.” The main glass that
                    would get down was the Press Officer's. By the time Lodge left I remember the
                    Press Officer rushed out and opened the door for him and couldn't find the
                    handle which was part of his car.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Syria? Syria at one point was a great grain
                        producing country. We are talking now about the mid-fifties.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: I am trying to remember about the grain. I remember going through some of
                    the grain areas, but at that time what was much more important to us was its
                    cotton production. It was expanding it's cotton production and there was a new
                    area that was opened up in the Euphrates Valley and we didn't know how extensive
                    it was. I went up there with a cotton specialist from the Foreign Agricultural
                    Service to examine this cotton production. I remember we started at the Embassy
                    in Damascus and went up to the Consulate at Aleppo. We took off from there up
                    the river. There was no road, just tracks through the desert sand. We hired a
                    guide so we wouldn't get lost. He said he knew the country like the back of his
                    hand. We hadn't gotten ten miles out of town before he was hopelessly lost. We
                    had a Chevrolet Blazer and the motor got so covered with dust it choked down.
                    The Bedouins were dangerous and it was rather a dicey trip. But we had some
                    wonderful experiences and saw a lot of cotton. They were using basically pumps
                    put into the Euphrates River. They were growing some wheat too, but the main
                    expansion in those days was cotton.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to your time when you were in Egypt. Nasser
                        nationalized the Suez Canal. Everybody was confined more or less to Cairo.
                        It was obviously a time of hostility and tension between the Egyptians and
                        Westerners. How did you operate in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: I can't remember in detail, but Mohammed Dessouky would go out and get
                    information and there were the Egyptian publications which he would translate,
                    and we had access to the telephone. So we continued to grind out the reports
                    that were due. They just weren't quite as detailed as they might otherwise have
                    been.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Embassy respond to what became known as the
                        Suez Crisis? We are talking about the fall of 1956.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: There was considerable concern about security. The Embassy buildings were
                    all within a compound with a wall around them. There was a gate at the entrance
                    and there was always an Egyptian who stood there as a guard and acted as a
                    receptionist as well. The gates were always open and no one was barred from
                    entering.</p>
                <p>On this particular day, I was somewhere around town and I decided to stop by the
                    Embassy and get briefed on what the latest news was. When we got to the Embassy
                    the gates were closed. That was a traumatic experience to drive up there and see
                    those gates closed.</p>
                <p>You may recall that the Brits were bringing out their dependents and the French
                    were bringing out their dependents. We were not. We were saying that we were
                    going to work with Nasser and saw nothing to worry about and left our dependents
                    there. This was a source of some anxiety for all of us in the Embassy. My home
                    was out in Maadi, which is on the desert in a suburban area some distance from
                    downtown Cairo. In this desert area lived a number of Americans. We had a
                    network of communications. It was my job to contact six families and give the
                    word, whatever the word might be. We wouldn't depend on the telephone for fairly
                    obvious reasons.</p>
                <p>When the British decided to bring out their dependents, there was a big debate in
                    the Embassy. The Ambassador brought in the DCM, the Administrative Officer, etc.
                    and they debated until well into the evening what word they were going to pass
                    out through this network. By the time it got to me it was 9:00 in the evening.
                    The word was that the Ambassador said the Embassy was watching things very
                    carefully. There was nothing to be concerned about at the moment. Don't
                    worry.</p>
                <p>I have to get into my car and drive around to these six neighbors. One of these
                    neighbors was a young Naval MD research officer who was over there on a Naval
                    research project. He had just moved into his house and had been unpacking all
                    day and hadn't been into the Embassy. I went up and introduced myself and said,
                    “The Ambassador says to tell you you are not to worry.” His wife is standing
                    there too. “I am not to worry about what?” I told him about the Brits
                    withdrawing their dependents, etc. This got him so upset he didn't get any sleep
                    all night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the actual 1956 war impact on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>HOWARD: Before the war happened, before the invasion, things had been getting
                    somewhat better. It looked as though the UN was going to be able to negotiate a
                    settlement. So, I talked to Pete Hart about resuming travel. He said, “Yes, I
                    think it is safe.” So my colleague, Frank Eamon [ph] was to go to Syria and
                    Lebanon and I was to go to the Sudan, but at different times so one of us was
                    always there.</p>
                <p>I found out that the Air Attach� was going to fly down to Khartoum in a Naval
                    plane and my wife could go if she wanted. So we arranged with American friends
                    who had a dependent, their mother, to come and stay in our house and look after
                    the children. Winifred went to Khartoum for her first visit, a long weekend. She
                    flew back and I resumed my trip.</p>
                <p>I had two missions. One was to go to the port. The Sudanese cotton came out via
                    one track railroad that wound up at Port Sudan. I was to go to Port Sudan and
                    study this situation, see about the chances for log jams for expansion, etc.
                    Then I was going up the river. El Mahdi's grandson was still living on an island
                    where El Mahdi came from and they had started growing cotton. This grandson had
                    invited me up there to study this development. I was keen to see it because of
                    the historical development.</p>
                <p>I got to Port Sudan and just as I arrived the hotel clerk said that my wife had
                    called. Well now Stu, this is in the middle of Africa and you know your wife is
                    not going to call to say howdy. I didn't want to show too much concern for
                    obvious diplomatic reasons. I tried to call her but there wasn't any chance of
                    getting through to Cairo. After asking, I was told that the next plane flew in
                    the next morning. None of this news had reached Port Sudan. So when the plane
                    arrived there was Jim Howard out on the tarmac. I really pulled my diplomatic
                    passport on that one. Thank heavens it was a British captain. As he stepped out
                    of the plane I said, “Captain, what's happening around the world?” He says,
                    “Well, do you want to start with Hungary or with Cairo?” The Hungarian
                    revolution was taking place. I said, “Well, Cairo was closer.” And he told me
                    what had happened.</p>
                <p>Later my wife got through a message saying that the Ambassador said I was not to
                    come back but to go to Rome and join them there. Now think about that. I have a
                    wife and two small children, an office and I am told not to come back. Well, I
                    got back to Khartoum pretty quickly and here was Ambassador Pinkerton and a
                    couple of assistants, that was all the staff he had, and Jim Howard sitting
                    around this big radio with ears glued to BBC, listening to the news. Eventually
                    I flew out from there via Libya to Rome.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Meanwhile, the decision had been immediate to evacuate the dependents. But how do
                    you get them out? At first we were going to send in American planes to take them
                    out. Winifred, my wife, was teaching math in the Cairo-American College, a high
                    school, because they couldn't get teachers due to the crisis. All the American
                    dependents went out and all but a small nucleus of the Embassy staff left too.
                    Somehow our house became a source of information for that area out there in the
                    desert. She said people were there until 10:00 that evening. She finally got the
                    two small children asleep and the phone rang and she was told a plane was coming
                    at 1:00 or 2:00 to take out dependents. Since she had a diplomatic passport and
                    could get through barriers easier than some others, she was told to be present
                    with her two children and one suitcase a piece that she would be able to carry.
                    She said, “My children have just gotten to sleep. Can't I come on a later
                    plane?” They finally agreed that she could.</p>
                <p>Well, the plane got there and Nasser wouldn't let it land and it had to go back
                    to Greece. So it would have been a waste anyway. They finally, several days
                    later, were allowed to go by car convey to Alexandria. You may recall that by
                    that time Dulles had rattled the sword a bit and said that Nasser was going to
                    allow an American ship to get in there and get those dependents or there would
                    be trouble. So she drove across the desert with these two small children and an
                    Egyptian and got to Alexandria. There was antiaircraft fire and bombs were
                    falling, but they were not hurt. She said that somebody struck a match to light
                    a cigarette and was almost jumped on. So they stayed that night and the next day
                    they were loaded on this Naval vessel that had been sent in to bring them out.
                    This, Stu, was done on a 24 hours basis. It was a troop ship full of Marines.
                    There were two compartments. Winifred was put in charge of the women and
                    children in one of these two compartments. She said, “There were women who were
                    pulled out like that who didn't know where their husbands were or couldn't get
                    in touch with them and didn't have any money, who were pregnant, etc. It was a
                    terrible thing.”</p>
                <p>They sat there in the harbor for hours because Nasser wouldn't pull up the mines.
                    They had to keep the kids out on the deck with life jackets in case they were
                    bombed. She remembers that our son was not very cooperative. But he stayed out
                    there. Finally Nasser did pull up the mines. The Egyptian ships were right under
                    the edge of our ship, shooting, antiaircraft fire, using our ship for
                    protection, which didn't make them feel any happier.</p>
                <p>But, anyway, when they did bring up the nets, every ship in the harbor started
                    out and one cut across in front of ours. By this time Winifred was privy to the
                    captain's discussions with the key people. He said, “Don't worry let him go
                    first. If there are mines out there they will harvest them.”</p>
                <p>Well, they did get out and went to Crete where they changed ships and then on to
                    Naples where I met them. I had two summer suits and a white dinner jacket and it
                    was October in Rome. My wife had taken my overcoat and stuck inside it jackets
                    of two winter suits and rolled it up. It was one of the most traumatic
                    experiences in our whole career.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went back to Washington from there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Yes. We stayed there for a couple of months. I was the senior officer
                    from the Embassy there and had liaison with the Embassy in Rome. Bill Crockett
                    was the Administrative Officer. He was a wonderful guy. This was a great trauma,
                    but we couldn't have been treated more kindly by the American community. We had
                    a good agricultural attach� there, a friend Ray Ogg, who was very kind to
                    us.</p>
                <p>But then there was the question of whether we would be going back. The children's
                    education was involved. Finally it was decided in Washington that there wouldn't
                    be enough work to justify an officer of my level, I had moved up a bit by that
                    time, so they sent my assistant, Frank Eamon, back in a sort of holding pattern
                    and I was brought to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we stop at this point and we will pick it up at
                        another time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: All right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are going to add something that should be put back when
                        you were running the Information Division.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: One of the jobs of the Information Division was to furnish press officers
                    for international agricultural conferences that were held in Washington. At this
                    time there was a wheat organization similar to the cotton one which was trying
                    to negotiate an international wheat agreement. The Soviet Union was an active
                    participant in it. I am probably just barely 30 and I am the press officer. The
                    Russians are having a cocktail party. I wondered if I should go to the Russian
                    Embassy. I found out that if I didn't go I was the only one of the staff who
                    wasn't going. I said I would go but still scary of that vodka. So, on my way
                    there I stopped at the Little Tavern hamburger joint in Arlington and got myself
                    a good milkshake and a hamburger so I wouldn't take that vodka on an empty
                    stomach. I get there and remember this big impressive stairway you went up.
                    There was a reception doorman type in full regalia to ask who you were. I said,
                    “I am James Howard, the Press Officer for the conference.” So he turned to the
                    people and said, “This is James Howard, President of the conference.”
                    Fortunately, nobody heard him. I walked over to the bar and asked for a vodka.
                    He said, “Sorry, we only have Scotch and Bourbon.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, thank you Jim.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is August 27, 1993 and we are continuing an
                        interview with Jim Howard. You left Cairo and came back to Washington in
                        1957. What were you doing when you came back?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>HOWARD: This was a rather abrupt transfer due to the war. FAS was at a loss for a
                    while as to what to do with me. I resumed some of my old work for a few months
                    but was then assigned to the Fats and Oils Division. This means soybeans. It
                    means cotton seed oil. It means peanuts. It means cobra and any source of edible
                    oil. But by far the most important one was soybean oil. Soybeans were the
                    miracle crop of this period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were the things that your father was growing on a
                        side pasture earlier on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Yes, and he was growing them mostly for soil building. This was another
                    commodity area to add to my education and I was pleased to take it. So I worked
                    there for a year before I was asked to take a new and more responsible job.</p>
                <p>I will just say this about the Fats and Oil Division, my job was to cover Europe
                    for the marketing branch, which was the one that had the responsibility for
                    gathering market information and encouraging marketing expansion. It was great
                    fun and a good education. It was in that same area that I was asked just a year
                    later to take a more responsible job.</p>
                <p>I think I mentioned earlier that Congress and the agricultural establishment of
                    America faced a fundamental decision after the Marshall Plan had run its course
                    and the Korean War had come and gone. We had had a tremendous demand for
                    agricultural products but now Europe was getting back on its feet to some
                    extent, at least people were not starving, and we were beginning to face
                    surpluses. I think I said that after World War I we decided to cut back
                    production. This time we decided to push foreign markets.</p>
                <p>The most important piece of legislation to do this was Public Law 480, the
                    Agricultural Trade and Development Act of 1954. This act provided that we could
                    sell surplus agricultural commodities to countries who needed them but were
                    unable to pay for them because of balance of payments difficulties.</p>
                <p>We had had a little experience in this before and it had worked. We would sell
                    soybeans to Germany, which was desperately short of foreign exchange at that
                    period, and they would pay for it in German Marks which we would agree to use
                    only in Germany—blocked currency. What were we going to do with this blocked
                    currency? How were we going to use it? Well, Congress in passing this
                    legislation listed quite a long number of things. At the top of the list was to
                    develop and expand new markets for US agricultural products on a mutually
                    benefitting basis.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>We had no experience in market promotion. We were an intelligence organization in
                    the old days. And here we were being forced to become an action agency. I
                    mentioned that the agency had just had new organic legislation and the name
                    changed to the Foreign Agricultural Service. We were bringing in some people
                    from the old Production and Marketing Administration who ran the Commodity
                    Credits Corporation, who had had a bit of experience selling agricultural
                    products for blocked currency. Among those was a bright young guy named Ray
                    Ioanes who had been with the Military Government in Germany. He later moved up
                    in that program and ran it for a dozen years.</p>
                <p>So, there was the question of how we were going to do this. The US government had
                    done no market promotion. The Department of Commerce was facing the same
                    question for non-agricultural products. They were just beginning to see how they
                    might go into it. There were several options. We could hire people and run it
                    ourselves, but we weren't sure how long we were going to have this foreign
                    currency. You hire a bunch of people and they soon become redundant.</p>
                <p>There were in existence a number of agricultural trade associations. One was in
                    the field of cotton. The National Cotton Council consisted of the cotton
                    growers, ginners, crushers, exporters, etc. who came together and formed a trade
                    association to push for cotton. They had a modest, but a pretty good budget.
                    They had already been doing foreign intelligence studying the cotton market in
                    Egypt, etc. They were also here in the US promoting cotton sales, working with
                    department stores to push cotton. They thought, and we thought, that that idea
                    would work abroad.So, to shorten the story just a bit, we decided that we would
                    go into partnership with these non-profit agricultural trade associations. There
                    was one for cotton, wheat, fats and oils, tobacco, fruits and vegetables, etc.
                    They had some dollars and we had some foreign currency. So the agreement was
                    that we would pay the overseas expenditures and they would pay the US
                    expenditures for personnel, domestic travel, etc. So we had a partnership.</p>
                <p>One very interesting thing there was to draw up a contract, which would protect
                    the government but still let these organizations do trial and error experiments
                    in a field which nobody knew much about. So very bright people, including a
                    lawyer named Ralph Cobel drew up a contract under which these associations
                    agreed that they would “endeavor” to expand these markets. It wasn't if the
                    market doesn't expand you have to give the money back. This language was found
                    to be okay by the lawyers and by Congress. So we developed these contracts.</p>

                <p>An example, if it looks as though cotton had good prospects in Japan, the Cotton
                    Council would go over there and meet with the cotton spinners, or maybe there
                    was an organization in Japan somewhat like the Cotton Council. If not they would
                    work with the cotton spinners and weavers and work out a program. The spinners
                    and weavers would put their money into it too because it would help their
                    business. So we were getting a multiplier effect in this money. They would do
                    all sorts of things. For example, the Cotton Council had an annual event called
                    the Maid of Cotton.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. I met one one time in Korea. A pretty young
                        lady.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: It was a competition something like Miss America but from the cotton
                    belt. She would be decked out in the finest wardrobe that New York designers
                    could come up with all made of cotton. She would go abroad and be hosted by the
                    cotton spinners and weavers in the various countries of the world. She was high
                    fashion and good press coverage.I remember, for example, when she went to
                    Thailand. The Queen of Thailand had never appeared publicly in any fabric other
                    than silk at the time. Well, the Cotton Council decided to talk her into wearing
                    a cotton frock. She was reluctant, particularly reluctant to give the Cotton
                    Council her measurements. But she finally did with proper protection. They took
                    those measurements back to New York and New York again designed some wonderful
                    gowns for the Queen of Thailand. And when she first showed up in that cotton
                    gown at a royal ball, it was big news. And so they created news all over the
                    world.</p>
                <p>I don't know how much this program can now take responsibility for it, but when I
                    go in to buy a golf shirt, I can't find one that is a fast drying one. They are
                    all cotton.</p>
                <p>I will give you another example since I just left the Fats and Oils Division. The
                    organization was created by the farmers that produce soybeans and the crushers
                    in this country. It was called the Soybean Association of America and headed by
                    a man named Harold Roach. Roach was an Iowa farmer who ran a farm management
                    company as well as some other business interests. He was bright, aggressive and
                    hardworking. He had the worse example I have ever encountered of contempt for
                    bureaucracy. His attitude was that this money had been voted by Congress and we
                    should just turn it over to him and leave him alone.</p>
                <p>Well, when I was still in the Fats and Oils Division, I had the dubious pleasure
                    of going to Europe with Harold Roach and his wife and one other man from the
                    industry, to meet with the various entities in Europe who might be interested in
                    cooperating.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>We would go, let's say, into Spain. The agricultural attach� would have made a
                    program and appointments with various people in the government and in the
                    industry. In these meetings Roach would explain what he was up to and see if
                    they were interested. Eventually there would be a program. Roach hired a man,
                    without money, who was a Spaniard and set him up in an office and directed him
                    in his work. It worked. For example, Spain is a big olive oil exporter. Spain
                    was desperately short of edible oil for its margarine and vegetable oils. But
                    they detested anything other than olive oil. Soybean oil? No way. Roach talked
                    them in to blending a certain amount of soybean oil in with their olive oil. It
                    would give it the olive oil taste, but it would be mostly soybean oil. This
                    would then allow the industry and the government to export a lot of this
                    valuable olive oil and thus bring in foreign exchange. That is the way it
                    started.</p>
                <p>I remember going over there and seeing a cartoon in their humor magazine, like
                    the New Yorker or the British Punch. It had a picture of a keeper of a castle.
                    The castle is being besieged. The defenders are up on the top pouring something
                    out over the attackers. The caption said, “It doesn't have to be boiling. If it
                    is soybean oil, that is enough.” But the success of the program overcame the
                    opposition. Eventually they started buying more and more oil and then they began
                    to buy our soybeans and crush them so that they would have not only the soybean
                    oil, but the residue from the crushing which is a meal that is a major
                    ingredient in our livestock feed. They used the meal and it tied in with our
                    efforts to sell them corn. It became one of the most successful programs.</p>
                <p>I could go on and on, but my job was to run a newly created division which did
                    two things, which provided the controls, the mechanism...we made the program
                    run. We did the budgeting. We did the regulations. We wrote the contracts with
                    these trade associations. We sent people overseas to run workshops to educate
                    the people they had hired overseas. It was an exciting program. At first we
                    didn't have to go to Congress because we got this fine currency direct from the
                    Bureau of the Budget. Eventually the Bureau of the Budget decided that was too
                    lose and they got Congress to say that we had to go through the appropriations
                    process. But it basically was almost free money and Congress was pushing it at
                    us. They kept asking us to expand the program. We kept saying that we couldn't
                    do it any faster than these non-profit groups can get people trained, etc. So we
                    began to do some it our self. We would do some of the research.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>We also organized a trade fair exhibit program. In other words, this was the way
                    you cut across commodities. Let's say in London there would be a big annual food
                    fair. We would mount an exhibit in that food fair and invite the American food
                    processors as well as firms like the Canned Peach Organization, etc. to come in.
                    The Cling Peach Association in California is a major exporter of canned peaches.
                    They had not done much overseas so we invited them to come and have an exhibit.
                    They would send some good people from the industry as well as their staff and
                    have a good show there in London. But while there these businessmen would get
                    out and talk to the importers of canned peaches. That way they would get their
                    feet wet, get some experience. Eventually they signed a cooperative agreement
                    with us to have a program of their own. That happened with a number of groups.
                    Most of these shows were modest in size, two or three hundred dollars in those
                    days.We had one in Europe for the top importers of Europe. I remember Arnold
                    Toynbee, the historian, was one of the featured speakers at one of the seminars
                    we had. It was exciting.</p>
                <p>That trade fair part was run by a young man named Ken Crow, a dynamic ex-bomber
                    pilot over Burma, India and China. He created it and ran it. It pretty soon was
                    made a separate division so I was not responsible for that for very long. But I
                    continued with this other.</p>
                <p>My wife was teaching school in McLean, Langley, and our children were in college.
                    So, my wife wasn't willing to leave home and quit teaching. So I was sort of
                    stuck for ten years. But it was an exciting ten years.</p>
                <p>Oh, one other thing I should tell you about. About the fourth or fifth year of
                    it, the House Government Operations Committee had a subcommittee that felt it
                    had jurisdiction in our area. It started looking into this program. The
                    investigator thought Harold Roach was too wasteful, spending too freely American
                    government money. He particularly started after him. He spent several years
                    looking into this program and writing draft reports and sending them to us. I
                    remember Ken Crow and I worked for three or four months solid answering this
                    draft report. We would be able to answer it to the satisfaction of people
                    outside, so the report never got issued. But Ray Ioanes, in the administration
                    section, said it gave him some sleepless nights.</p>
                <p>That was the only negative aspect of it over the whole ten years. Otherwise it
                    was Congress and these farm organizations thinking highly of it. It got so
                    popular that in subsequent years the appropriations just skyrocketed and I
                    wonder if it is not much too high now.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it seems to be almost contrary to my experience and
                        I think others have had, not with farm products but with other American
                        items for exports, that how poorly, particularly in the fifties and sixties,
                        many of our major firms were in promoting export items. We had a big market
                        in the United States and the firms weren't willing to make concessions to
                        specific needs of other countries. It was a sort of take it or leave it type
                        thing. They would put their headquarters in a place like Geneva or Brussels
                        and then wouldn't get out into the hustings to find markets. I know when I
                        was in the Persian Gulf firms just wouldn't come there to try to sell
                        anything. It was a small market in those days, but they wouldn't make the
                        effort. It seems like the farm commodity people were much more aggressive
                        and willing to go out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Maybe it was the nature of the farm products. You speak of the Persian
                    Gulf area. I recall going to Iran and Howard Roach had an office in Iran. We
                    were selling them a lot of soybean products. I don't know what ever happened to
                    the market, but it was a good one then. Part of the success may have been the
                    fact that the world was short of food in those early days and particularly short
                    of industrial products that came from agriculture, like soybean oil, for
                    example. They were short of protein in their diet so ingredients of livestock
                    feed were not too difficult to push.</p>
                <p>Take Japan. Here was Japan after World War II. They had been defeated. General
                    MacArthur was doing a good job. We wanted to be helpful. We helped them rewrite
                    their constitution. Our wheat people went in there into a rice eating
                    environment and worked with the school lunch program. We were buying them
                    skimmed milk and helped them organize a school lunch program. It gave the kids a
                    good extra meal a day. It was extremely popular and it sold our products.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Around 1970 you went to the Senior Seminar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Yes. Ray Ioanes, who was my boss and a close personal friend, decided
                    that it was time for me to make a move and he selected me to go to Senior
                    Seminar. Many people, who you will be interviewing, have been to that Seminar
                    and will feel just as I do that it was the finest year of my life. It was a
                    wonderful experience. I made friends that stand me in good stead today. My class
                    was the 13th. It produced maybe five men who became ambassadors. I think it is a
                    fine institution. In fact I drove by the new campus off route 50 today. I
                    couldn't tell much about it but I hope I will be invited to the opening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, you will. And then our organization will move over
                        there. So you left in 1971. Where did you go then?</hi>

                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>HOWARD: After the Senior Seminar I was made Deputy Assistant Administrator for
                    Market Development. This means that I moved up and was the deputy to the person
                    who was running the program. It was a year or two before Winifred agreed to stop
                    teaching and I again was sent abroad.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: From 1972-77. We were there for five years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you think about an agricultural attach� in Sweden, it
                        is a little hard to figure out what one would do there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Remember I had just come from ten years in marketing development. The
                    Swedes are a wealthy nation and import a substantial amount of their food. So on
                    a per capita basis it is an excellent market for US agriculture. Much of my
                    effort was to work with these non-profit trade associations in pushing markets.
                    We had two or three of these trade fair exhibits while I was there. We did all
                    sorts of interesting new things, but we also did the bread and butter.</p>
                <p>The Cotton Council was there. Sweden had a good cotton textile industry with some
                    fine mills and designers. I was also accredited to Finland during those five
                    years and went over there a number of times a year. Meyer ____________, who your
                    wife will know, is a fine designer of cotton textiles sold worldwide. So in both
                    these countries there were good cotton mills and great designers and some very
                    good exporters. So we pushed with them and had a successful program.</p>
                <p>I mentioned canned peaches earlier. I remember the canned peach man who was
                    stationed in Europe would come over a couple of times a year and I would go with
                    him to call on the big food chains and push the market. I would have a reception
                    for him and give the prestige of the Embassy to this effort. We would have a
                    reception maybe in the Embassy.</p>

                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>HOWARD: I never did have an Ambassador who interfered. They varied in their
                    enthusiasm for it. Our Ambassador during much of my time there was Strausz-Hup�.
                    He liked to go to receptions I used to put on. I would take him around to meet
                    some of these trade people. He wouldn't remember their names, but he was a
                    gracious person. I had no criticism with his support.</p>
                <p>But over in Finland, for example, the Ambassador there was a non-State Department
                    man, who had been a radio station talk show operator and owned a radio station
                    in Washington, Mark Aldridge. He was a wonderful guy. He was trade oriented. He
                    said, “Jim, any time you want to have a reception in Finland, you are welcome to
                    have it in my house.” He enjoyed these things. We worked well together.I
                    remember, for example, towards the latter part of my tour there I was invited to
                    go fishing by some of the agricultural leaders of the country. I said, “Would
                    you mind if I invited the Ambassador?” “Oh, of course not. We would be
                    delighted.” So we went fishing with them. Now fishing with the Finns is an
                    experience. In the first place you are out in the Baltic Sea and the fishing
                    rights of a piece of water are owned by the person who owns the island nearest
                    to it. So you have to get the fishing rights to go out there. But that was no
                    barrier to these people who included the big dairy of Finland. They had an
                    island out there for a base and a nice boat. We picked up the island owner who
                    owned the fishing rights, he went with us. But some of the leaders of the
                    agriculture of the country were there. There was an ex-banker and an ex-Foreign
                    Minister. The Ambassador enjoyed it. I remember the boat lurched and a door
                    slammed on his hand and hurt him terribly and he grinned and bore it for 24
                    hours until there was the chance to get him off and back to Helsinki where he
                    found out two bones were broken in his hand. But he had stuck with the fishing
                    because there was a good deal of alcohol drinking at night and good food. It was
                    good foreign relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Sweden during the early seventies. Relations
                        were, to say the lease, cool. I mean regular relations. Olaf Palme was the
                        Prime Minister who was a good solid Socialist and going around sticking it
                        to the United States any time. You had President Nixon, supported by Henry
                        Kissinger, who didn't take this lightly. How did this intrude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Olaf Palme was a well educated person. In fact he was a graduate of
                    Kenyon College in Ohio. Where he irritated us unbearably was in his criticism of
                    the Vietnamese war. My wife was as critical of that policy as Olaf Palme, but
                    she said, “You know, to have that guy preaching to us day after day and I am
                    suppose to sit there an take it, it is pretty hard.” And it was hard to take. I
                    have forgotten what happened and triggered Nixon to angrily say, “Bring our
                    Ambassador home.” The State Department said, “He is already home.” “Don't let
                    him go back.” Then the DCM somehow got out of the country. Anyway, the Embassy
                    was run for eight or ten months by the chief Political Officer, whose name was
                    Arthur Olsen. He was not a career Foreign Service officer, but had been in the
                    Foreign Service for some time. He was a journalist by training. Art Olsen ran
                    that Embassy and we never had a better period. He was a good administrator and
                    we all got along famously. I kept pushing markets for agricultural products.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There weren't movements a foot to boycott American
                        products?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: I always thought of myself as a fairly liberal person. But back in
                    California the grape growers were having their problems with a labor organizer,
                    Caesar Chavez. My sympathies were completely with him as he was trying to
                    organize the workers over there. But as one of his tools he was working in
                    Sweden, for example, to try to get the big food chains to boycott American
                    lettuce. Now here is where my respect for Caesar Chavez's efforts ran counter to
                    my job in Sweden, which was to sell lettuce. I waited for Washington to give me
                    some instructions. They were caught between the same rock and hard place. I
                    finally developed some copy to give to these food chains defending their buying
                    the lettuce...things they could do to answer their public. I sent a copy back to
                    Washington telling them what I had done. They immediately published it and that
                    became our policy on these things.</p>
                <p>There was a guy over there covering that part of the world for Caesar Chavez and
                    he ran an article in The Nation criticizing what we were doing and Jim Howard by
                    name. So, for a guy who almost didn't get to go abroad because he was a Democrat
                    under Benson, to be criticized by the farm workers rounded out the picture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in about 1977 you went to South Africa. Is that
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1977-81. Now this is a whole different
                        atmosphere from where you were before. What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: I wasn't excited when asked to go to South Africa. Again, I suppose about
                    99 percent of the people in our foreign service were not favorable to the South
                    African government's policy of apartheid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was doing the high apartheid period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Yes, and as a product of an Alabama farm who knew racial intolerance
                    firsthand and whose neighbors and so forth had been party to it, I felt very
                    strongly on this. But Agriculture wanted me to go there and my wiser friends in
                    the State Department in Stockholm said, “Look, Jim, we have a full staff there
                    and all of them feel just like you. It is a job. You are asked to do it and you
                    go ahead and do it.” So, Winifred and I went. You can only wear your conscious
                    on your sleeve a certain amount of time. The rest of the time you have to go on
                    living.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>From a standpoint of creature comforts, South Africa was as pleasant as any post
                    we ever had, perhaps the most pleasant. We had a nice house and two competent
                    servants. The weather was ideal. On a cold winter day Winifred could go out on
                    the terrace by 10:00 and have a cup of coffee sitting in the sun. There was a
                    country club just down the road. It was good living and not a bad place to wind
                    out our career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you particularly working on there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: South Africa is a significant agricultural producer and exporter, so they
                    were interested in some of the same products, the same markets as we, but they
                    were also significant importers from us. Fruit, for example. They were a big
                    exporter of fruit to Europe. These same voices that were trying to boycott
                    Caesar Chavez were also trying to boycott South African oranges and apples, etc.
                    in Europe. As soon as these boycotts started on South African oranges, they just
                    changed the name to Swazigold...Swaziland being a black independent nation
                    within South Africa. It was the darling of my friends in Sweden so they would
                    import these Swazigold oranges with great gusto.</p>
                <p>The Department of Agriculture had continuous problem in Europe, particularly with
                    the Germans, about regulations on insecticide, pesticide, residue left on fruit.
                    You are going to spray apples to keep the bugs from eating them. Only a certain
                    amount of that residue can be on them when they reach the consumer or you are in
                    trouble or prohibited entry. They don't like you to use certain pesticides.
                    Well, of course, our agricultural producing interests were contrary to those
                    consuming interests to a certain extent, although our consumers in this country
                    felt somewhat like that. So we were constantly negotiating with these Europeans,
                    particularly the Germans, to not put into affect regulations that would make it
                    impossible for our fruit, which met US standards to come in their country.</p>
                <p>Okay, the South Africans faced that same problem. They were exporting oranges and
                    apples to those same countries. So we would work together with the South
                    Africans and other countries, the New Zealanders, etc., that exported fruit to
                    Europe to try to keep them from making these regulations that we thought were
                    unjustified from the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it the feeling that these regulations were really
                        designed more to protect the domestic producers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>HOWARD: This was a complicated issues. Most of them, I think, were designed to
                    protect their consumers. But we thought they could protect their consumers in a
                    way that still would allow us to get good wholesome fruit to them that would
                    have a decent shelf life. There may have been a little internal European
                    Community politics in it. The Italians raised fruit and the Spanish raised fruit
                    and they were quite willing to see our fruit disadvantaged in that market.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the Ambassadors when you were there and how were
                        they dealing with the problem? This was mostly with the Carter period wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Bill Bowdler was Ambassador there for just a few months after my arrival,
                    and we had a pleasant relationship. He was succeeded by Bill Edmondson. Bill
                    Edmondson and I worked together for three years. I never had a more pleasant and
                    fruitful working relationship with anyone regardless of organization. He was
                    just a find officer who knew his job and did it well and was considerate of his
                    people. We remain good friends to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know Bill and also have very high regards for him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Let me use this story to illustrate how an agricultural attach� can be
                    particularly useful to an embassy. The US is doing all it can within its
                    limitations of international diplomacy to discourage apartheid and encourage the
                    black leadership of South Africa and we needed all the information we could get.
                    Now many of these blacks lived in these homelands. I, as an agricultural
                    attach�, had a legitimate reason for going to those homelands and studying their
                    agriculture. Agriculture was about all they had.</p>
                <p>So I made detailed reports on the agriculture of the major homelands of South
                    Africa. They were appreciated not only by Bill Edmondson and his immediate
                    staff, but in the State Department.</p>
                <p>One illustration. I wanted to go to Natal to Quazulu, the homeland of the Zulus.
                    The South African government was reluctant to have me go in there without them.
                    Bill Edmondson's advise to me was, “Jim, you can let them help you but you don't
                    ask their permission. You can go.”</p>
                <p>Well, the man who was responsible for it in the South African government happened
                    to be a guy who I was playing golf with and we got along famously. He said,
                    “Jim, I will set up a program for you. Whatever you want to do.” I said, “One
                    thing I want to do is meet a chief.” You meet with individual black farmers and
                    you meet with the white people working with them, but I had never met a chief to
                    get that point of view on agriculture in the homelands. He thought it was a good
                    idea. He really laid on a good program doing what I asked him to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>The chief they chose was the King of the Zulus. We have heard a lot in this
                    country about Boudelaize, the Prime Minister, but we haven't heard much about
                    the King of the Zulus, whose name is King Goodwill. King Goodwill was not nearly
                    as bright as Boudelaize, but he spoke good English and he was no fool. He
                    entertained me for a nice lunch. The economic counselor of the Embassy was with
                    me. I was quite impressed by the role the King played. For example, as we were
                    served, people coming in baring dishes would stoop low because the King was
                    sitting. Some of the lowest people would come in literally on their knees. The
                    chief agriculturalist, who was my immediate guide, was pretty high up and would
                    bow slightly, but they all showed this great deference for the King.</p>
                <p>The King was very cordial. That item in the corner of the room is a knob carry.
                    King Goodwill presented me with it when I left, one of the weapons of the
                    Zulus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A head knocker.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: That's right. This is a ceremonial piece with beads representing the
                    various elements of their culture. I don't know how many Americans have had
                    lunch with King Goodwill. It was quite an interesting experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that our rather adamant antipathy towards
                        apartheid, particularly during this period under the Carter Administration,
                        which was very heavy on human rights, have much effect on your effectiveness
                        in getting your work done?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOWARD: Yes. But let me say first that I found apartheid to be more complex than
                    I had expected, but I found it even more insidious than I had realized. So I had
                    not the slightest reservation about our government's policy. When I would invite
                    agricultural leaders of South Africa to my home, they would come, but they would
                    not reciprocate. This was not true of the business community. I had good
                    relations with the farmers organization. The head of the organization had me
                    down to his home, a farm in the country where his mother, who is British, and
                    still remembers the fighting of the Boers and her being put in prison by the
                    Boers and she was English. She had never forgiven them. Those relationships were
                    very pleasant.</p>
                <p>I have traveled all over South Africa. I had a Blazer, a government vehicle, to
                    get out over the rough country. Winifred and I traveled the whole country. The
                    farmers were without exception open and delighted to have me. We had wonderful
                    discussions and they would arrange whatever I wanted. It was fine. This was not
                    a personal thing with the agricultural leaders, it was their government's policy
                    to be cool towards the US government in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left there in 1981. Where did you see things
                        going at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>HOWARD: There was no way I could see the status quo remaining. The black
                    population was growing. Let me give you a small story. One of the US products
                    that we were exporting there in considerable quantity was rice. The rice growers
                    of Arkansas and Louisiana had an office there that was running this program.
                    Rice was pushed in the white community because they had the money to buy rice.
                    But while I was there, even in those four years, that program was shifted based
                    on good market research and they began to put on radio programs.</p>
