                <p>W. ROBERT WARNE</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 1, 1995</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rob, let's start kind of at the beginning. Could you tell
                        me a bit about your family, when and where you were born, and a little about
                        your early years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Sure. I was born right here in Washington, DC My dad was, at that time,
                    with the Department of Interior. He was an assistant secretary and had various
                    jobs. He came in in the Roosevelt era and was an Associated Press editor here in
                    Washington. He was picked up by the Roosevelt administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have 1933.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Well, yes, you're probably right. He just came in after the administration
                    got established. He was first a public affairs person at the Interior
                    Department, and he worked his way up through the ranks and was appointed
                    assistant secretary, I guess first by Truman. So I grew up here. My childhood
                    was right here in the Washington area, although my family was from California.
                    Dad and my mother both had grown up in California. So I have roots on both ends
                    of the continent.</p>
                <p>My dad saw that the Truman administration was likely to pass and the torch was
                    going to Eisenhower. And he took an appointment, just at the end of the Truman
                    administration, to go out to Iran as the AID mission director. Eisenhower
                    confirmed that appointment, and Dad was one of the first AID directors. At that
                    time, it was called Point Four, or TCA, the Technical Cooperation
                    Administration. He was in Iran for, I think, close to four years, but I only
                    spent the first year there. I went to school, my first year of high school, in a
                    small community school in Tehran. The school was inadequate because standards
                    weren't very high. And the situation became unstable. There wasn't any serious
                    threat to the students, although I had a couple of incidents against myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things were happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>WARNE: Well, I was running track one afternoon, and a group of Communist students
                    surrounded me and threatened me. Fortunately, the other members of the track
                    team, who were Iranian, came to my defense. I had two other incidents: once,
                    while I was riding my bicycle, someone tried to run over me; another time,
                    someone tried to force me off the road. The premier, Mosaddeq, recommended to
                    Dad that I leave the country.</p>
                <p>So I went to Hawaii, on my own, and joined my uncle there for two years and went
                    to a prep school, Punahou. I boarded one year and lived with my uncle the
                    other.</p>
                <p>And then my family was reassigned to Brazil. So I moved to Escola Americana in
                    Rio de Janeiro and finished my senior year of high school there, without
                    incident.</p>
                <p>Then I went on to Princeton University. I majored in international affairs at the
                    Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton and graduated in 1960.</p>
                <p>I went through ROTC, and received a commission, I spent two years in the
                    artillery in the Army. I served as an executive officer and battery commander in
                    artillery at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.</p>
                <p>After completing my two-year tour, I took an appointment with AID to go out to
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about that? You'd watched your father in
                        the trade, right, really, from the beginning. Often, sons don't want to do
                        what their fathers have done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Well, no, Stu, actually I enjoyed living overseas. I was just the right
                    age to go overseas. I was just thirteen. I found Iran exciting and numerous
                    opportunities to travel. My dad encouraged me to see the country. I spent
                    several weeks with the Bakhtiar Tribe. The family went to the Caspian and to
                    Shiraz. Dad made a number of trips to inspect various AID projects. I had a
                    chance to go along on some of those trips.</p>
                <p>It was a difficult time. Dad was caught, really, in the middle. I didn't know all
                    the ins and outs; I was just a kid. The CIA was trying to undermine Mosaddeq,
                    the premier. Dad had just exactly the opposite guidance, to help the Mossadegh
                    government out. It was a complex situation. Dad was there through the coup
                    d'ï¿½tat, or the revolution, however you want to describe it, when the shah was
                    reinstated to power. It was a highly charged period. I can remember numerous
                    times of insurrection in the city when we were there.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed the travel and the excitement. When I went from Tehran to Honolulu, I
                    had a chance to stop in five - Karachi, New Delhi, Bangkok, Hong Kong and Tokyo.
                    I rented a cab, in New Delhi, for example, and went to see the Taj Mahal. So
                    when I got to Hong Kong, I bought myself a camera and toured the city. So I
                    really had a wonderful experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did one get into the AID program at that time? You
                        went in in what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: I joined in 1962. I had taken the Foreign Service exam, and was hoping to
                    become a Foreign Service officer. On three occasions, I passed the written exam
                    but flunked the oral. My final try was just before I went to Vietnam with AID.
                    In fact, I was leaving for Vietnam the very week I took the oral exam. I passed
                    at that time, probably in part because the board was impressed with my
                    determination. I had taken the job with AID and volunteered to go to
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Basically, I'd wanted to do something overseas, I knew AID was recruiting, so I
                    sent them a letter and applied. There was no interview system; just two phone
                    calls. AID had my resume, and they offered me a job on the spot, by phone. It
                    was certainly different than what the Foreign Service would have done. AID sent
                    me to Washington just long enough to sign the contract and get a passport. Then
                    I was in Vietnam. It was literally two or three days. No training or
                    preparation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I like to get the stance. The first time you went to
                        Vietnam, you went there as...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: I only went to Vietnam one time, and that was a two-year tour with my
                    family- my wife Susanna, and baby daughter of six months, Robin. We arrived in
                    Vietnam in December of 1962, and left in December of 1964.</p>
                <p>AID was so anxious to recruit me and others like me. It was building up a program
                    called Provincial Operations, which was assigning Americans to the provinces to
                    administer local AID programs. I happened to be the first AID officer assigned
                    to the Mekong Delta. It was an experiment. As an exception, AID allowed me to
                    take my family along. The family did not want to be separated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation like in Vietnam at that time, as
                        you were told before you went out? Obviously, you weren't told much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: I really didn't know even what I was going to be doing, when I left
                    Washington. Actually, the situation was fluid and contested by the Viet Cong. We
                    were trying to get a grip on what was happening. We were assessing what our
                    program should be. Our mission was âto win the hearts and the minds of the
                    people.â Our aim was to consolidate the Vietnamese government's presence and
                    governance. The issue was how we could grapple with a civil war, or
                    insurrection, and best respond to it. We were experimenting to see what would
                    work with us.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>When I arrived in Saigon, I went in to see my boss, Rufus Phillips, who, although
                    I didn't know it, had had a career in the CIA. Rufus had now surfaced as an
                    embassy officer and was coordinating the Provincial Operations program. He was
                    highly effective, energized and dedicated and assessed conditions
                    accurately.</p>
                <p>Provincial Operations had a budget of, I'm not even sure exactly how much - it
                    was twenty or thirty million dollars for this program. I was allocated about a
                    million dollars and assigned to two provinces. Rufus called me in and said,
                    âWell, Rob, I'd like you to go down to these two central provinces in the Mekong
                    Delta, Vinh-Long and Dien-Binh.â A colleague introduced me to the two province
                    chiefs. I found a place to live and set up a program. I didn't have any other
                    guidance. I knew that I was supposed to develop programs to respond to the
                    province chiefs' and the communities' needs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just want to get a little feel about how we went about
                        this. How old were you when you went there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Twenty-three.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you're twenty-three years old. You're sent...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Just out of the Army and college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And no particular training.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Absolutely none at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they hand you a volume of guidelines of what you were
                        supposed to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: They only thing they handed me was a map.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I weren't a former government employee myself, I'd
                        think that was incredible. Was there anybody before you went out you could
                        talk to and say, gee, what are the options?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: No. I was required, once a month, to write a report about the program.
                    From that, and from the various other reports from the provinces around the
                    country, we developed common guidelines.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Basically I was a community-action officer who was trying to extend effectively
                    the reach of the government into the countryside.</p>
                <p>Frankly, I think the description that the U.S. military advisor used to describe
                    the Provincial Operations program was quite apt: âDynamic inexperience.â We were
                    very anxious to go out and do things. We had resources and were determined to
                    show results.</p>
                <p>There were three or four guidelines that I quickly developed myself. One was to
                    complement the province governor. I did not do anything without his involvement
                    or without his commitment that he wanted me to undertake it. He and his staff
                    needed to be involved in the project and, most importantly, identified with it.
                    I didn't want it to have a U.S. identification to the program. Our goal was to
                    build the capability of the provincial and district governments.</p>
                <p>The second guideline was that [I wanted to do something that would] impact on the
                    local communities in the countryside. I found that there were five or six things
                    that we could do that the people needed badly. These were impoverished, rural,
                    rice-growing areas. I went to each community to determine what the communities
                    needed and what the people would become involved in. I developed a flip chart
                    that described how the province and the local people could participate together
                    in community-action projects. From those discussions with each of the village
                    councils and local communities, we would identify local projects.</p>
                <p>These broke down into building schools, providing school supplies, digging wells,
                    providing livestock, or poultry, fertilizer, building a bridge, providing a
                    nurse and medical supplies. Refugee relief was a major component. We had a
                    number of people who were relocated out of areas because of the
                    insurrection.</p>
                <p>Military engagements occurred daily. A lot of people didn't realize that in that
                    period, in the middle '60s, there was such a buildup of the Viet Cong. There was
                    a V.C. regiment in each of the provinces. These were broken down into mobile
                    platoons and squads. I have a map here that will show the pattern of military
                    incidents. We had at least 30 or 40 incidents a month. Many of them were
                    assassinations, bombings or sniper fire. I was caught in 40 or more incidents
                    myself while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that your presence was a problem to the
                        province people? I would think that the whole idea, on the part of the Viet
                        Cong, would be to discourage aid coming from the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>WARNE: Yes, the Viet Cong systematically destroyed the projects whenever they
                    launched an operation. Whenever there was an incident against my person, it was,
                    I think, indirect. The American military picked up leaflets and other
                    information that purported the V.C. had a price on my head. It seemed like a
                    large amount of money at the time. But there was a price on everyone's headâthe
                    province governor and the U.S. military adviser and othersâso I was not being
                    singled out. I was exposed. I went throughout the two provinces everyday. I
                    sometimes I preferred to go without a military escort. I never felt that I was a
                    direct target. But I'm sure that if the V.C. had had the opportunity, they would
                    have killed me. I had several vehicles mined while I was there. The closest
                    incident I had was when the province governor and I walked into an ambush. The
                    V.C. shot two of the soldiers with us.</p>
                <p>The Viet Cong did not know what to do with me. I wasn't a hostile, in the sense I
                    wasn't out trying to kill them.</p>
                <p>They also exploited our activities. The V.C. used our grain (we had a lot of
                    bulgur wheat and cooking oil) for their own purposes.</p>
                <p>It was a discouraging effort. During those two years, we were losing the war. I
                    could see it visibly. When I first arrived there were many remote areas I could
                    go to and work in. By the time I left, many of these areas were insecure. Our
                    schoolhouses and other projects were torn down. The security deterioration made
                    it much more difficult to travel. Several of the roads to the district towns
                    that I regularly used were blocked. One time, I actually had to persuade the
                    province governor to let me use an antique tank and a platoon of soldiers to
                    clear the road in order to get some supplies through. I was increasingly
                    discouraged. My reports described the pattern of attacks of the Viet Cong. They
                    were squeezing the province towns. They built roadblocks and took over the
                    villages and transportation around the provinces.</p>
                <p>Another discouraging feature was the uneven quality of the local leadership. One
                    province governor, Major Minh, was particularly effective. He knew how to work
                    with the people, and had integrity and honesty. But we had other province
                    governors who did not measure up. There were five during the time I was there in
                    just one province. The government also changed several times in Saigon. This
                    dramatically impacted on our effectiveness. In fact, frankly, at some points, I
                    was really the province governor because I had resources and capability. The
                    military advisors and I helped to hold things together during these turbulent
                    times. But we were continuously losing ground to the Viet Cong.</p>
                <p>I worked very closely with the military. That was one of the things that I made a
                    point of doing. I'm not sure all of my colleagues did. I wanted the military to
                    know exactly what I was doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the American military.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>WARNE: Yes, and also the Vietnamese. At first, until my family moved to the
                    province with me, I lived with the military. I was doing, and I tried to design
                    programs with their participation. I think they appreciated that. I always had a
                    good relationship with the military, in one of the provinces. In the other
                    province...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: This was Vinh Long, which was the more prosperous and important of the two
                    provinces. It also had a larger population - about 200,000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the capital?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: The city of Binh Long was the capital. And I have a map here I'll be glad
                    to show you.</p>
                <p>But I had an adverse experience, partly due to my inexperience. The province
                    governor, who was a well-trained, French-educated colonel, exploited the
                    population and his situation. I began to pull back from giving full support to
                    him.</p>
                <p>The province had a poorly conceived program of building strategic hamlets,
                    essentially barbed-wire fortresses around villages. The purpose was to prevent
                    the Viet Cong from night attacks and infiltration. It was not a well-conceived
                    plan because the villages could not be protected in this manner. We put a lot of
                    resources into strategic hamlets which remained vulnerable.</p>
                <p>At that time, the government required each province to report the amount of
                    hamlets that had been secured and the effectiveness of the security.</p>
                <p>This governor wanted to look good. Instead of securing the individual villages,
                    he built an immense barbed wire fence and mote around his province. Perhaps over
                    600 kilometers. This effort was not sensible. There's no way you could secure
                    such a long barbed-wire fence. He also used forced labor tbuild the fence.</p>
                <p>I objected.</p>
                <p>This was not the plan. The aim was to develop the resources for the community,
                    not exploit the people.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>When I objected, the province governor became incensed. He reported to President
                    Ngu Dinh Diem that I was not cooperating. The government undertook an official
                    inspection.</p>
                <p>[I told my boss about this situation, and he actually was called in by the
                    president and asked who this guy was and what was going on.]</p>
                <p>Well, my boss, Rufus Phillips, got a U.S. Navy plane to fly over the province and
                    photograph the long barbed-wire fences, to demonstrate that the province was not
                    following the instructions of the strategic hamlets. He gave the photos to the
                    president's brother to respond to these accusations. My situation with the
                    governor had come to a breaking point. I bid farewell. He was proud and rigid. I
                    never developed a good personal relationship with him, although he was very kind
                    to me. I stayed in his home a couple of times.</p>
                <p>The last time I stayed with him, I gave him a bottle of scotch. And he insisted I
                    open the bottle and take the first drink. He thought I was trying to poison
                    him.</p>
                <p>He told me to take this road out of town. A MAAG (Military Assistance Advisory
                    Group) advisor, a captain, said, âWhy don't you take an alternate road.â I'm
                    glad I did because I avoided an ambush.</p>
                <p>The province governor was related to the president. He was protected politically.
                    But they did transfer him six months later from that job. The Viet Cong
                    continued to expand its control over the rural areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously, you didn't speak Vietnamese. How did you find
                        out what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: I spoke a little French, and I did study Vietnamese. I had an interpreter.
                    I did most of my business through an interpreter. This interpreter became a
                    close friend. He escaped from Vietnam after the war. With our help his family
                    and he now live here in the Washington area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was corruption a bad problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: It was a serious problem and never controlled adequately. For example, we
                    would allow expenditures for gasoline; there was no way to control vouchers. But
                    corruption was not rampant. I didn't have all that much money. Much of the aid
                    was in kind. I would buy uniforms, equipment or seed. I don't think anyone
                    really made a lot of money over me.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>I would always get equipment such as trucks and pumps from whatever sources would
                    be available. Communications came primarily through the local telegraph.
                    USAID/Saigon sent me a wire saying 17 rehabilitated WWII trucks were available.
                    No one seemed interested in them. I said, âI'm coming to get them.â They added
                    to our transportation capabilities. The Vietnamese military used them more than
                    I did. That didn't bother me; they needed the trucks. I did not draw a line
                    between the civilian and military activities.</p>
                <p>Regarding corruption, I had some problems. Two or three province governors were
                    free-wheeling. I was careful about the release of funds, but some funds were
                    misused. In one case, I had to halt expenditures because of malfeasance. Frankly
                    the lack of effective government and commitment by our Vietnamese counterparts
                    were our most troubling problems. The Vietnamese at the provincial and district
                    [levels] in some cases undermined our efforts to win public support and
                    cooperation for the government.</p>
                <p>But for the most part, our programs had an impact.</p>
                <p>Provincial Operations used to compare Defense Secretary Robert McNamara's visits
                    to Vietnam to a division attack. He would just overwhelm us with requests for
                    data and analysis.</p>
                <p>I filed several reports about the difficulties to carry out our programs; and we
                    were losing ground and lacked effectiveness.</p>
                <p>These reports caused several confrontations with McNamara's senior staff. They
                    called me up to Saigon. I disagreed with their conclusion that things were going
                    well. I said, âI can only speak for the provinces I know, but conditions are
                    exactly opposite from your conclusions. We're losing ground. It's just a matter
                    of time before these provinces will be taken over by the Viet Cong.â I
                    illustrated with four maps. One map of portrayed the Viet Cong activities in the
                    province; every terrorist incident was marked on it. Secondly, a map showed the
                    secure areas where we could operate. The third described the number of strategic
                    hamlets and the number kept shrinking. Finally, a map located our programs and
                    those which had been destroyed or abandoned. McNamara's staff questioned my
                    analysis. They said that I didn't know what I was talking about.</p>
                <p>They did make one credible point. Senior staff said, âSome of those early
                    strategic hamlets were not well established, you didn't have effective presence,
                    and the security program has now been consolidated. Perhaps so, but the area
                    controlled by the government was shrinking and this contraction occurred during
                    the entire period I was in Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Another major effort that was not going well was the Vietnamese military directed
                    me to relocate tens of thousands of refugees from areas that were Viet Cong
                    controlled. We were trying to strip them of resources and population. Relocating
                    these people was a terrible job, because I lacked the capability to relocate
                    several thousand people from their homes and provide them with basic services,
                    medical care and foodstuffs. A number of small, temporary communities were
                    built. But the people returned to their homes at the first opportunity. Many
                    were hardened Viet Cong by the time they left. I tried to discourage the
                    program, but I often was instructed to do it. Large relocation as a retaliatory
                    measure against the Viet Cong was a serious mistake.</p>
                <p>A Special Forces unit was stationed in one of the most insecure areas. I used to
                    fly in to see them and help with various programs. It was a very hostile area.
                    We always received ground fire whenever we flew in or out. During my assignment,
                    the Viet Cong gained control of the entire district, except for the immediate
                    area around the Special Forces camp. The US team was a thorn in the V.C.'s side
                    but did not check their insurgency.</p>
                <p>I came to the conclusion that we just didn't know how to prosecute the war. We
                    were in a civil war that called for a different approach. We had a weak
                    government, a government that was not committed to prosecuting the war. For
                    example, the Vietnamese objective was to avoid casualties. The military often
                    avoided closing with the Viet Cong. The Vietnamese leadership was often corrupt
                    and ineffective. There were some exceptions however. Some Vietnamese were very
                    good officers. For the most part, we had an uphill battle. Unless we were really
                    willing to commit millions of men to secure the countryside, we couldn't make
                    the difference by presenting the war under those conditions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during the coup that took Diem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Yes, I was there, but I was not in Saigon at the time. Many expected a
                    change because Diem and his family were being criticized and seemed
                    ineffective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that have any particular effect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Yes, it did. It had a destabilizing effect. Most key positions were
                    changed. All the old relationships were cut. New inexperienced people took over.
                    It was a turbulent period. There was a noticeable slowdown in governmental
                    leadership and programs. For the most part, key positions were given to cronies.
                    The selections were not based on merit. Frankly these Mekong Delta provinces
                    were given secondary priority. The best officers went to jobs in Saigon, other
                    cities and major commands. This was a mistake I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was John Paul Vann down there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Yes, he was. He was not far from me. He started in Long-anh, which was the
                    province north of me. He had a different approach as a military leader. I did
                    not direct the military operations. His experience in presenting was similar to
                    mine. For example, the Vietnamese military refused to close with the Viet Cong
                    in both operations.</p>
                <p>We had two or three major engagements with the Viet Cong during the time I was
                    there. We never had an engagement larger than company size, but we had several
                    company-sized attacks. Several US military officers were killed. On two
                    occasions the V.C. attacked the provincial capital in which we lived. Those were
                    mainly skirmishes, however. Once a mortar round dropped near our home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're speaking about Americans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Yes. The American military advisors were competent and dedicated but not
                    the ebullient, strong leader and outspoken type that Vann was. I can remember
                    sitting on the steps of the province chief's house when one of the majors was
                    leaving as head of the advisory unit. He said, âRob, I just wish I could say
                    that I accomplished something during the year I was here. I didn't really make
                    any difference.â</p>
                <p>When I left Vietnam, I was assigned to the Vietnam Desk. Actually, I was first
                    assigned to go to Brazil. My assignment was changed to put me on the Desk. I
                    returned a year later on a presidential evaluation mission led by President
                    Johnson's Special Assistant Robert Komer. I went back to my old haunts. I
                    reversed the course of Komer's evaluation. He started in the north, and I went
                    first to the south. I covered many of the same stops, during the ten days of the
                    visit.</p>
                <p>One of the most heartrending experiences was in the visit to the province town of
                    Vinh Bink-Phu Vinh. I had been there two years and knew people. The same
                    province governor Colonel Tranh was in charge. The military advisor, Colonel,
                    Muckerman, was also there. DoD had extended his tour. We discussed their plans.
                    They said, âWe're undertaking a new operation. We're going to secure Cau-Ke
                    district. We have two battalions reinforced with so many armored personnel
                    carriers and artillery. The V.C. headquarters were going to be surrounded.
                    Permanent ARVN presence was to be established.</p>
                <p>I said, âI participated in a similar operation with the previous province
                    governor about two and a half years ago. I camped out in the district for
                    several weeks; got eaten up with mosquitos and suffered from diarrhea. We lasted
                    about three weeks before withdrawing. We lost so many men by booby traps and
                    sniper fire that we gave up and pulled back. It was just a terrible experience.
                    We thought that we had the forces needed to secure the district.â</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>They said, âWell, it's different this time. We've got it organized.â</p>
                <p>I said farewell to them as they went off to lead their units.</p>
                <p>I heard later that the province governor got out on one side of his jeep and
                    Muckerman on the other. A land mine went off and blew the province governor's
                    leg off and badly wounded Muckerman. That ended that operation.</p>
                <p>We never learned. We never developed the experience and the know-how to prosecute
                    the war. Our personnel were rotated every year. The Vietnamese commanders
                    changed even more often. We never figured out how to combat guerillas and
                    operate in a civil war. Perhaps we could not win the war. But operations focused
                    on local areas in a concerted, comprehensive way would have slowed the V.C.
                    down, if not reversed, their success.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're obviously looking with hindsight. But let's go back
                        to the McNamara people you were talking to when you were there. Were these
                        people who were resolved on a course and they wanted to have the figures
                        that looked good to them? McNamara had this tendency...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: To quantify everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that it had to be positive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Yes. It was an attitude that was cultivated by the way that we ran the
                    military. Civilians were just as bad; I'm not saying it was just the military.
                    We brought people over on short assignments, eleven months to a year. They
                    needed to demonstrate accomplishment to get promoted. The President wanted to
                    win the war. We were providing a lot of resources. We were determined to make it
                    look good.</p>
                <p>Saigon was removed from reality. As a result, fictitious accomplishments became
                    the rule of the day. I'm not saying that everyone was being misled or satisfied
                    with reports. I can remember Al Kromer talking to the President's advisor for
                    Vietnam. He was a real terror, a tough guy. His nickname was âblow torchâ. In
                    quiet moments, he said, âWe really are dealing with a civil war.â But no
                    official would ever say that publicly.</p>
                <p>I had an interesting experience when I first arrived at the Vietnam Desk. Komer
                    called âHey, Warne, I understand you've been out in Vietnam and you know the
                    situation.â</p>
                <p>I said, âYes, sir.â</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>He said, âThe University of Michigan is going to have a teach-in, and they want
                    to have someone to tell the students about the situation in Vietnam. Would you
                    do that?â</p>
                <p>I have never been so scared in all my life. I was confronted by 10,000 screaming
                    kids ready to tear me from limb to limb. I shouted over their yelling and I got
                    out safely. Attending those teach-ins was not a good idea. We were a magnet to
                    draw people in. Things went downhill rapidly regarding public support for the
                    war. The president was caught in a difficult situation.</p>
                <p>When I got back from Vietnam, Len Unger, a deputy assistant secretary, was in
                    charge of Vietnam at the State Department. He called two or three recent
                    returnees to ask us for advice. The issue was whether we should increase U.S.
                    forces. This was early in '65. The president had a DoD proposal to send 50,000
                    more troops. The first major commitment of US forces.</p>
                <p>I was the only one in the group who opposed a troop commitment. I said that,
                    unless we were willing to commit major resources in the two provinces â at least
                    a regiment in each province â we would not succeed in those areas. Even with a
                    regiment in each province, it would be difficult to prosecute the war. Without
                    being able to have dominant presence in each of the provincial districts we
                    couldn't drive the Viet Cong out. Otherwise we could secure some of the roads
                    and key communities, but the rest of the countryside would be controlled by the
                    Viet Cong. My family and I had a unique experience setting up household in a
                    town of 25,000 one hundred miles south of Saigon. My wife taught school until
                    the principal asked her to stop for security reasons. At first, we were able to
                    drive to Saigon, but shortly we relied on air transport for food, mail and
                    travel. When we left, we flew out by helicopter. Suzy, my wife, would be alert
                    for a plane to buzz the house each week. This was the grocery, mail run. She was
                    the only Caucasian woman for much of the time. Life magazine did a four-page
                    story on us just before we left. It was a major blunder to escalate the war. We
                    committed US forces to an open-ended situation. We lacked the will to provide
                    the troops and long term commitment to gain the upper hand. Without such
                    determination, we should never have gotten involved in a civil war in which the
                    Viet Cong had the upper hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were back in Washington, how did you find the
                        Vietnam working group you were on? You were in an AID working group.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>WARNE: No, I wasn't. I didn't explain what happened to me. My appointment to the
                    Foreign Service came through when I was in Vietnam, and on one of my trips up to
                    Saigon I was sworn in. Since they were now assigning FSOs to the provincial
                    jobs, I was converted from a reserve to a regular officer position. I continued
                    on in the position same salary and grade. I made a mistake. I probably would
                    have had a more successful career if I'd stayed in AID. I came in as an FSR-8.
                    That's the lowest rung of the Foreign Service reserve. I was promoted one rung
                    while I was in AID, and State picked me up as a seven. But AID had already put
                    me in to be promoted to a six. I would have gotten ahead more rapidly in AID and
                    was headed for program management.</p>
                <p>When I was ready to return to Washington, the Embassy at Saigon said there was no
                    reason to give me any training. I had already been in the field. The beginning
                    A-100 Course was waived. I didn't have any language qualifications, so I
                    couldn't get promoted above a six without passing the language exam. State was
                    going to send me to Spanish, but it pulled me off to go on the Vietnam Desk. I
                    ultimately took Spanish on my own in early morning classes.</p>
                <p>I had orders to go Brazil. During transit, I offered to give a briefing to the
                    Vietnam working group â the inter-agency-level management of Vietnam.</p>
                <p>I had an illustrative report on what went on in Vietnam from my perspective in
                    the provinces. It had four parts: community action; the military situation
                    illustrated by several maps of how the Viet Cong was taking control; the
                    leadership in the local area; and finally an evaluation of progress issues. I
                    had one series of photos of the results of U.S. bombing raids on a Buddhist
                    temple that had killed several Buddhist monks. I explained how the Viet Cong had
                    drawn us into the engagement.</p>
                <p>When this incident happened, I went to the division headquarters and complained
                    to the division commander. It had really set our program back. I lost effective
                    relationships with two district chiefs because of it. I had gone to see the
                    Dai-Duc Mekong, the Senior Buddhist monk, to make homage and apology. He allowed
                    me to give restitution for the monks deaths and rebuild the temple. That was not
                    the only incident, there were several like that. I tried to get across to the
                    military that this was not productive.</p>
                <p>There was an Air Force general at this working group briefing who got very angry
                    at me for this description of what happened. So I got a little notoriety out of
                    that confrontation.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Unger asked me to stay on in Washington rather than go to Brazil. I
                    joined the State Department's Vietnam working group. I was one of the five on
                    the Desk. I spent about two years on the Desk. By the time I left it had more
                    than doubled in size. During the entire period I was the most junior officer on
                    the desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there about '64 to '66?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Actually, it was '65 to '67. I left Vietnam just at the end of '64.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, with this working group, that there was an
                        attitude that we have to see things in a positive light, Americans can do
                        anything, we can do this? What was the feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: No. The desk had the attitude that the Administration needed to do a
                    better job of improving the capability of the Vietnamese government, and
                    broadening its political base. We focused on political development through
                    development of the National Assembly, and broader participation of the populace,
                    and strengthening responsiveness. For Example, the Desk worried about the
                    Buddhist demonstrations, and other dissident groups.</p>
                <p>No, the working group did not have an attitude that we had to do anything to win
                    the war, and that we were going to cover up the problems. The State People had
                    integrity and were honest about developments. But the Desk was not in the
                    driver's seat. The military was running the war. We could have done more,
                    however, to explain to the administration what our problems were. We were
                    dependent on the embassy and the AID mission for reporting. Everyone wanted to
                    be positive and make progress.</p>
                <p>Those involved knew the war wasn't going well. We ran an around-the-clock working
                    group in times of stress in Vietnam. I happened to be in the operations center,
                    on the phone to Saigon, during the Tet Offensive. I was the first one to get
                    reports on how the country was breaking up. We all knew it was coming. We did
                    not anticipate Tet; that took everyone by surprise.Essentially, what we were
                    trying to do was hold a deteriorating situation together.</p>
                <p>I was assigned primarily to follow developments in the Mekong Delta and
                    coordinate activities with USIA and AID. I had never been in an embassy. I had
                    an entirely different background than the other officers, who had all been in
                    the embassy political section in Saigon. They had different skills. I learned a
                    lot. If I was going to be a Foreign Service officer, that's where I had to
                    start. For example, I prepared each week a worldwide assessment of developments
                    in Vietnam which was used as talking points for all of our embassies and
                    spokesmen.</p>
                <p>When I returned from the trip to Vietnam in 1966, I wrote an extensive report
                    describing how the war was not going well.</p>
                <p>Komer, on the other hand had come back with a very positive report.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>My boss, Ambassador Robert Miller, recommended that it be sent over to the White
                    House. But it never went anywhere. In fact, I don't think Len Unger ever read
                    it. I followed up a couple of times and asked if he'd had a chance to read it.
                    And he said, âI've taken it home, but I was so tired, I didn't get it out of my
                    briefcase.â My views didn't make any impact at all.</p>
                <p>I can remember my boss getting angry with me one time. USIA wanted to set up a TV
                    network throughout Vietnam â TV in all the local villages. This was to get our
                    message across to the local population. The American military was anxious to get
                    TV out there for the troops for entertainment purposes. USIA took excessive time
                    to prepare its proposal. My boss kept getting more and more angry with USIA for
                    dragging its feet. He worried that McNamara would say, âLet's do it. The hell
                    with the USIA. The troops need it now.â I just couldn't get USIA to move. It was
                    one thing after another. Thus, all of us had difficulties in moving a lethargic
                    administration. Washington was not on a wartime footing, although the Desk
                    worked. We used to work around the clock when emergencies occurred.</p>
                <p>The Department asked me to do a lot of public speaking. I was in nearly every
                    major city and on numerous radio and TV programs. I described the AID program
                    and the community action effort. AID also used me for recruitment.</p>
                <p>One of my peculiar jobs on the Desk was to review FBI files on demonstrators. The
                    FBI sent over regular reports on demonstrators, perhaps 10 to 20 a day. I just
                    filed them. It was a waste of time. The agent would be sitting in a car on the
                    corner; the suspect would be walking across the street. Great detail about
                    nothing.</p>
                <p>Obviously, the administration was struggling with a very strong civil uprising in
                    our own country against the war. We weren't handling that well at all, either.
                    We just couldn't cope with the justified public outrage about prosecution of the
                    war. Eventually, the opposition knocked Johnson out of the White House.
                    Fortunately, I had left the desk before the peak of the outrage. By that time
                    the Johnson Administration had blundered seriously over Vietnam. Its leaders
                    refused to accept reality â the U.S. could not dictate terms that produced a
                    favorable outcome for it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARNE: I went to Argentina.</p>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>WARNE: We went there in '68. (siactual date was 1967. Ed.) I had Spanish-language
                    training, and was assigned as the financial officer. I followed the IMF
                    (International Monetary Fund) stabilization program and did the financial
                    reporting for the embassy for the first year. I was the assistant to the
                    Treasury attachï¿½. And then the ambassador asked me to be the commercial attachï¿½.
                    This amounted to a two- or three-rung jump in the assignment level to run the
                    six person commercial section. Argentina was very exciting. The family and I
                    enjoyed it immensely. We had two children by then, a daughter and son. My wife
                    taught school as she did in all of our subsequent assignments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '68 to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: From '68 to '70.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation in Argentina when you
                        went down there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: It was relatively stable. There was a military dictatorship under General
                    Onganï¿½a. It was a benign dictatorship. There were not any terrorist acts going
                    on. Economic stabilization under the IMF and USAID was the main program. They
                    were trying to stabilize the country, prospects were looking good. The economy
                    began to turn around.</p>
                <p>It certainly is a wonderful country. We had just an exciting assignment. As
                    commercial attachï¿½, I traveled to every province, 23 in total. My wife went with
                    me, and we had a wonderful time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the financial side. Had Perï¿½n pretty well
                        looted the treasury before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: No. It was a badly divided country, obviously. The Peronistas, the labor
                    socialist groups in the country, still had a great deal of power. But the
                    Onganï¿½a government had worked out an accommodation and had secured itself
                    politically.</p>
                <p>No, there was no turbulence, violence nor disappearances in the 1968-1970 period.
                    The government was dealing with practical problems. I felt that our ambassadors
                    during the period, Carter Lane Burgess and John Davis Lodge, struck me as being
                    out of touch with things. Both had personal agendas, the first to promote
                    business and the second himself. But the American delegation at the American
                    Embassy was, I think, quite effective.</p>
                <p>My relationships with the government were productive. I worked closely with the
                    finance minister and his deputies, and played a role in engineering the IMF
                    program and U.S. support for it. I was encouraged when U.S. investments began to
                    flow in.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>The Embassy worked closely with the business community. We regularly met with the
                    business community to discuss business proposals. We promoted some new
                    investment. We put out a weekly account of the business opportunities and
                    possible joint ventures â a news analysis of commercial opportunities. The
                    commercial section developed a network around the country with business people
                    and chambers of commerce, which showed an American presence and involvement in
                    the country. The government stabilization was taking hold, the economy was
                    growing and Argentina was beginning to achieve its potential. But the weak point
                    was Onganï¿½a himself. He was a dictator and eventually passed from the scene.
                    Argentina then went through another turbulent period with high inflation and
                    slow growth. Its prospects â always bright but never realized â were again set
                    back.</p>
                <p>It was a wonderful assignment as far as our personal life was concerned. My
                    family enjoyed many wonderful experiences. My wife taught school, the kids grew
                    up and enjoyed the school and country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Argentines are European based. Was there a natural
                        affinity between trade, as far as Europe and Argentina? Was it difficult for
                        us to do business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Not at all. The plurality of the population is Italian, by origin, but
                    there are many British, Germans and other nationalities. The Argentines
                    identified with the United States. I never felt reservations towards Americans.
                    No, not at all. We had an active international and local community in which we
                    were involved. We enjoyed the Argentines very much.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the American Chamber of Commerce pretty active

                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Yes. They needed the embassy to resolve issues with the government. U.S.
                    business was doing very well. American companies were prospering and expanding,
                    and new ones were coming in. It's such a wealthy country with many
                    opportunities, that if you had leading-edge technology and local presence, you
                    could do well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Why Argentina had never got its act together, become a developed
                    country?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why it was, as you saw it at that time, because I think we
                        were still looking at this...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: There were three or four things that impeded progress in Argentina.</p>
                <p>One is that they were not as commercially driven as many countries. Maybe it was
                    because they were living off the fat of the land, the estancias.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are the ranchers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Life wasn't that difficult. The wealthy, landed gentry enjoyed a good
                    life. They had all the meat, wine and pleasure that one can have in a beautiful,
                    rich country.</p>
                <p>Secondly, Argentina had gone through the Peronist period â a socialist oriented
                    time. The economy was burdened with a lot of inefficiencies â inefficient state
                    enterprises, a large social welfare program, and militant organized labor. These
                    conditions combined to create a situation in which it was difficult to
                    revitalize the economy to be efficient.</p>
                <p>There was also a lack of political consensus to develop political institutions.
                    Argentines failed to come together as a nation. They were divided by their
                    ethnic differences.</p>
                <p>Finally, they suffered from a stop-and-go situation. A couple of years of
                    progress, as during the time I was there, and then they got off the track again.
                    They never had sustained economic growth going despite the many possibilities.
                    Argentina should have focused on stability, on opening the market to investment,
                    on being more efficient, on reducing the government overhead and on eliminating
                    inefficient state enterprises. They never came to terms with these needs. During
                    the time I was there, the programs were headed in the right way, but they never
                    sustained it for a long enough period to make it work.</p>

                <p>WARNE: Yes.</p>

                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>WARNE: I went to the Office of Development Finance in the Economic Bureau of the
                    State Department. I had a two-year tour there, where I essentially handled four
                    jobs. My main one was to work with the World Bank, IMF and the Asian Development
                    Bank. I was the State Department officer who reviewed the loan applications and
                    obtained advice input from each of the Desks to evaluate U.S. contributions to
                    these agencies and the loan projects. I was also the State representative on the
                    Export-Import Bank board. I represented the political interests. Whenever there
                    was an Ex-Im Bank loan or credit coming under consideration, I assessed the
                    political point of view from a foreign policy perspective. I also worked on the
                    Asian Development Bank. This was my most substantive work, because this was a
                    formative period for the bank. The US was working with Japan and others to
                    create an effective Asian leading institution. I went to a number of the Bank's
                    board meetings and played a role in helping to design the U.S. relationship with
                    the bank. The ADB is still a very vital institution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your economic background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: I majored in economics, at Princeton, but only had a B.A. degree. I went
                    through the economic course at the Foreign Service Institute. Then in 1972-7I
                    received an M.A. in economics from Johns Hopkins University and passed the Ph.D.
                    written exam in economics qualifying. ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: FSI was an intensive one that brought you up to the
                        equivalent of a Master's Degree rather quickly, didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: I guess so. To be honest with you, I don't think it was that strong a
                    course. I breezed through. I was the top student in the class. Frankly, it
                    wasn't any tougher than Princeton. No, I didn't think a lot of the course. A
                    couple of the professors were excellent. In fact, one I still have a
                    relationship with. I enjoyed it, but I don't think it really equipped me as an
                    economist.</p>
                <p>Since the Department has such excellent training opportunities, I secured a
                    mid-career university program and went to SAIS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: SAIS being...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>WARNE: School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins. I took one year
                    at night at SAIS, and then received a mid-career university assignment for a
                    year. That was excellent, I was able to have a full, intensive year. I doubled
                    my course load by taking six or eight courses a semester. I qualified for the
                    Ph.D., and took my Ph.D. exams. It was an excellent opportunity. This training
                    equipped me as an economist. I'm not saying that I'm a top-level analytical
                    economist, but it certainly gave me a boost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It gave you the instruments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: I had two years in the Office of Development Finance. Then I was made a
                    section chief, heading up the food aid program in the Department, which was a
                    good job. I enjoyed that. I had a staff of about three or four people, and I
                    essentially supervised our worldwide food aid with the Department of
                    Agriculture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we go to the food aid. At this time, we're talking
                        about, what, '70 to '72ish, when you were with the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: 1970-72.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: International finance, the international organizations
                        that you were dealing with. Were the State Department and Treasury both
                        pretty much on the same track? How did you find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: We were not on the same track at all times. Treasury had an interagency
                    committee in which I represented the Department. The committee reviewed loan
                    applications of the multilateral development banks. I spoke for the views of the
                    various State country desks. Commerce, Agriculture, Labor and others would also
                    sit in on it, along with Treasury. At that time, there was no USTR. It was
                    superficial review. The banks would bunch their loan proposals near the end of
                    the fiscal year. You'd have to review 20 or so in one week. They're
                    comprehensive documents: a couple of hundred pages.</p>
                <p>At times, our views were heard and acted on by Treasury. But if there was
                    anything controversial, Treasury would take it to a higher level. We had a role.
                    Treasury needed political inpuwhich State provided.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>I had more of a role in two areas. One was with the Asian Development Bank,
                    because the U.S. had a clear political stake in establishing the bank. The U.S.
                    helped decide who the members would be, what our lending role would be vis-ï¿½-vis
                    the Japanese, the U.S. leadership in it, a concessional window, conditionality
                    and so forth. It was a more substantive role for State. Treasury monitored the
                    World Bank and the Fund and handled both institutions mainly on its own. The ADB
                    has become one of the most important regional lending institutions. It enjoys
                    congressional support and has helped promote Asian dynamism.</p>
                <p>The second area was UNCTAD, the U.N. Committee on Trade and Development, on the
                    developing-country forum for considering international economic issues. A
                    Treasury officer and I monitored the financial aspects of UNCTAD. UNCTAD was
                    driving to have the IMF allocate special drawing rights [SDR's] to provide added
                    financial resources to developing countries. Treasury was adamantly against it
                    because it would be inflationary, distort the money supply and other factors.
                    State went along but I took a little softer line. It wasn't quite as vigorous in
                    its opposition as Treasury was. I attended the UNCTAD plenary meeting in
                    Santiago for six weeks as a representative.</p>
                <p>I also represented us at the ECOSOC regional meeting at Manila for one session.
                    The Russians and U.S. were differing on issues for political reasons. I was able
                    to head off some of their initiatives. I enjoyed that. But it was just an
                    economic-officer job for the most part.</p>
                <p>The Chief of the food-aid program had some interesting aspects. The food-aid
                    program worldwide amounted to several billion dollars annually. The U.S. was
                    making substantial contributions to ease hunger and promote agriculture through
                    food-for-work programs. Food aid was going to well over 60 countries. The
                    section coordinated these programs with our embassies, decided on priorities and
                    coordinated with other countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were these food-aid allocations chosen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: They were allocated on the basis of need, market access and opportunities
                    to develop markets. There were a wide variety of exports, but cereals were the
                    principal commodity. Indonesia and Thailand were big recipients and various
                    countries throughout Africa and Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we trying to get wheat in, as opposed to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: In part, the wheat met basic human needs. We were also promoting U.S.
                    exports. A credit of up to three years was granted. Longer-term terms were used
                    in special cases as was food grants. As you know, the U.S. developed some major
                    large PL 480 accounts around the world that were used to found the local costs
                    of AID programs.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in the position where every American ambassador
                        would send in a request, gee, we need food aid, and you'd have to determine
                        which ones?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Sometimes. But food aid was more driven by the Department of Agriculture
                    to promote U.S. agricultural exports. USDA would draw up proposed allocations. I
                    would coordinate with the embassies to determine appropriate amounts and how the
                    food distribution would be supervised.</p>
                <p>We had an intergovernmental committee in Washington that reviewed our and other
                    countries', particularly French, food exports, to try to determine that we
                    didn't displace commercial markets, i.e. uniform marketing requirements, UMRs.
                    UMRs were based on a three-year running average of what the country was
                    importing commercially. We had to make sure that commercial imports were first
                    met before we woulprovide subsidized food aid. Since these markets were often
                    growing, the three-year average wasn't always a reflection of what the
                    commercial need might be. We probably did displace some commercial imports. That
                    was really the issue, whether we were displacing the French or ourselves, and
                    how we'd control. A lot of commercial competition was involved.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you get involved when all of a sudden there was a
                        famine somewhere or a disaster?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Yes. We worked closely with the Office of Disaster Assistance. We would
                    help develop emergency food supplies. AID primarily managed these examples. We
                    would coordinate the State and international aspects of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the food coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: USDA bought it right off the U.S. market. Some of it was in storage. It
                    was in part a commercial operation to prop up the prices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, was it about '75?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>WARNE: No, '74, actually. Subsequently, I was stationed in Brussels with the
                    European Community for three years. I was developing a specialty in finance and
                    economic analysis. I had three tasks in Brussels with the European Community.
                    First, was financial reporting, following monetary, tax, exchange rate and
                    macroeconomic policies. The second was to handle our development cooperation
                    policies with the Community, mainly the EC's Lome convention with over 60
                    developing countries. I also worked on trade issues. The European Community at
                    the time was going through a major transition. It was moving from six to nine
                    members and was coming to grips with increased economic integration. Just a
                    fascinating time to be there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our attitude? Did we see this European Economic
                        Community as being just a wonderful thing? Or did we see it as a potential
                        trade rival or a closed market?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: No, not at all. The U.S. attitude was positive about the Community. We
                    were trying to assist in its evolution, strengthen it, and cooperate with it. We
                    had trade problems, a chicken war, for example, and other issues. Those were
                    normal commercial squabbles. Overall, we were determined to see the Community
                    strengthened. We looked upon the EC as a means to integrate, stabilize and
                    develop Europe. If we could bring about reconciliation, we would secure a
                    longer-term stable environment for ourselves and the Europeans. These goals were
                    achieved, the EC has been a been very positive force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes this gets lost when we talk about things. This
                        is true of NATO and everything else. If there's a war in Europe, everybody
                        gets involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: That's right. And not only that, but we benefit in other ways â political
                    stability, peace, a stronger Europe. These factors mean a better market for us.
                    Europe has been a good market for us, both trade and investment. The U.S. had a
                    unique role with the Commission of the EC during that time. I knew more about
                    what was going oin the European Community than many of the Europeans within the
                    Commission. I was horizontal, cutting across the activities if all the
                    directorates. I followed everything that was of importance to the U.S. The
                    Commission and Council âthe member states' decision-making body â were
                    accessible. They welcomed U.S. diplomats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could talk to everybody.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>WARNE: There were no problems. I had complete access. I met with the top people
                    and the working level officials. I made sure to meet with all levels. I
                    networked all over, filing two or three reports a day. For example, I followed
                    the devaluation of key currencies. I knew as much about it as the bankers did.
                    Or what the Community was doing on a certain specific trade issue or its
                    regional and country specific development plans. I did my dissertation for a
                    Ph.D. in economics at SAIS, The Johns Hopkins University. I completed the course
                    work and passed the Ph.D. exam before leaving for Brussels on what I felt was a
                    novel idea, the Lomï¿½ Convention. The Convention tied the former colonies of
                    Europe into a network of aid recipients that would be given preferential aid and
                    trade advantages. Recipients set up a governing board to help run the
                    substantial aid program (which was a lot larger than our own). It was based on
                    equality and collaboration. And they had a series of guidelines they followed. I
                    felt it had some insightful ways of administering aid that we could draw on. So
                    I spent quite a bit of time, on my own, studying the program. I hate to admit it
                    to you, Stu, but I never received my doctorate. I finished a draft of the
                    dissertation, but I gave the draft to my SAIS advisors who wanted me to rewrite
                    it. I was put in another job and never had the time. I really regret never
                    finishing it. The Europeans had a continuous flow into Brussels of leaders from
                    Africa, Asia and the Caribbean into the Community. These talks had as much
                    political content as economic. I would regularly assess European policies around
                    the world, whether it was about Vietnam, China or South Africa. I did quite a
                    bit of analytical work on the political side as well as the economic. The Lome
                    Convention was a key vehicle to consolidate the EC hegemony in several
                    regions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You probably had as strong an economic background by this
                        time as one could get within the Foreign Service. How did you find dealing
                        with the people who were putting together the European Community? How did
                        they treat the Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Well, they treated us fine. I'll give you just three vignettes.</p>
                <p>That was during the period when we had the first oil disruption by the Middle
                    East; OPEC was showing its colors as a cartel. The U.S. and European-led
                    initiative put together a coordinated response. It didn't work out well. I had a
                    good relationship with several of the delegations that were working on this. The
                    Community would coordinate its position, and then meet with the Americans and
                    others in Paris. I gave the meeting insights into the European position and how
                    the EU felt about the meeting. In fact, I got an award for doing the work. But
                    all agreeOPEC was not serious about collaborating and could not be trusted. The
                    effort collapsed. The consumer response was to organize the International Energy
                    Agency (IEA) as a cooperative consumer group. The IEA began stocking oil to cope
                    with an OPEC-caused crisis. The Europeans came out with something called the ECU
                    (European Currency Unit). No one knew what the hell this was about. So I went
                    trotting up to a couple of my friends (one headed up the Monetary Committee;
                    another the Financial Committee), and I asked, âWhat in the world are you
                    talking about? What is this ECU.â</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>They replied, âRob, it's nothing. It's just an accounting unit. We're trying to
                    figure out how we can blend all of our currencies together in a basket for
                    budget and accounting purposes. It's just a unit of account. Nothing more.â</p>
                <p>I responded, âAre you giving me a straight story? You sound like you've got
                    something up your sleeve.â âOh, no, this is it.â I filed a report: âThe EC has
                    come up with a new unit of account, officials say it is just a bookkeeping
                    device to keep the accounts. Don't believe it. They've got other motives. This
                    is part of the goal to strengthen the single market.â Today of course, the ECU
                    has evolved into the euro and is becoming the single currency. I also worked on
                    European Monetary Uniowhich was just beginning. Maastricht confirmed the goal,
                    which will be achieved as planned. It took 25 years of hard work to overcome
                    member country opposition. But it represents a major achievement.</p>
                <p>A third vignette was my effort to expose the Europeans to the United States. The
                    USIA international visitor grants were tremendous assets for State Department
                    officers. I don't think we make enough use of them. I got to select three or
                    four visitors a year â the bright, young Europeans who were nationalistic. They
                    spent a month traveling the United States.</p>
                <p>One Frenchman, who's still a good friend, and a chef de cabinet for agriculture
                    at the time, had almost a religious experience. He was dying to go to the Grand
                    Canyon. He'd read about it and seen pictures of it. We arranged for him to fly
                    over the Grand Canyon and to go down it. It was just a marvelous experience for
                    him. He was just a different person when he came back. Surprisingly, many
                    important Europeans were quite provincial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you left Brussels when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: I left in the middle of '77.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And where'd you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: To Washington. I was first assigned to the East Asia Bureau, which I had
                    been out of since my Vietnam period. I was the deputy director of the Economic
                    Office for two years. My main effort was to help shape the new subregional
                    group, ASEAN, work with the emerging Asian Development Bank and focus on Japan,
                    China and Korean economic policy.</p>
                <p>At that time, I was promoted to an FSO-1, what's equivalent to OC. It was
                    equivalent to going through the senior threshold, which is a much more difficult
                    task today than it was then. I was just 41.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>As an FSO-1, I was looking for an office directorship. I was given the
                    opportunity to move over to the Latin American Bureau and be the director of the
                    Caribbean Office, which I think was the best job I had in the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: That was '81 to '84.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we're talking about Ronald Reagan and the Caribbean
                        Initiative and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a new president coming in, with a rather feisty
                        ARA Bureau coming in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: They just cleaned house. Actually, I had about a year under the previous
                    administration, the Carter administration, before Reagan came in.</p>
                <p>Yes, I remember vividly my wife and I watched the inauguraparade. I stopped by
                    the office on the way home. There was a call from the White House saying the
                    president had decided to invite Edward Seaga to Washington the next week. He
                    wanted the State Department to organize the trip. The White House staff was so
                    new that they didn't even know where their desks were. It was a fascinating
                    experience to put Reagan's first state visit together. My big job on that one
                    was to give Seaga something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Seaga was who?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: He was the prime minister of Jamaica, just elected. He had thrown out the
                    so-called Communist, Michael Manley, who was close to Carter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Manley was quite a thorn in our side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Yes. I knew Manley pretty well. I liked Manley. He was a Socialist, not a
                    communist. But, anyway, Seaga was the man of the hour. The White House said, âWe
                    need a new initiative to help Seaga.â We were already retooling our aid program.
                    Seaga could just about write whatever he wanted in the way of checks. We asked
                    David Rockefeller to lead a special private sector initiative for Jamaica. The
                    goal was to promote investment and turn the economy around.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The White House comes up and says we've got to have a
                        little gift for a prime minister coming up. Do you, as office director, sort
                        of have some of these tucked in your back pocket?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Not at all. I was fortunate. I had a great boss, John Bushnell, who was
                    the senior deputy assistant secretary in the ARA Bureau. John and I came up with
                    the idea of calling David Rockefeller, who obviously wanted to get along with
                    the Reagan White House. He was willing to respond to Reagan's appeal. The
                    initiative went on for several years, but was restricted by lack of
                    opportunities in Jamaica. It spurred several investments but the economy
                    remained sluggish. I had really a turbulent first year on the Desk. A terrible
                    hurricane blew through the Eastern Caribbean and devastated several of the
                    islands. I coordinated the aid relief effort for that.</p>
                <p>At the same time, they decided to inspect the office. I'd just been on the Desk
                    for about a month or two. Additionally, our office was closed for
                    rehabilitation. We worked out of temporary quarters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just long enough to be assumed to know something, but not
                        long enough to really know anything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: The Department put modular units in our office. They tore out the office
                    to put in modular units. No one had desks, phones or staff. It was a disaster. I
                    slept in the State Department during those periods. I'll just give you two
                    vignettes. Caribbean Affairs had 22 little countries to look after, and eight
                    embassies. Something happened every day. One was Grenada. I was the only officer
                    that the Department would allow to talk to the Grenadian authorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when they really had gone septic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: They had gone really leftist. They were just terrible. They were thugs. My
                    job was to be just as tough in responding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go down there at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>WARNE: I never did go to Grenada. This would have been an unwanted positive
                    signal. I met with the leadership elsewhere, mainly in Washington. I really was
                    given very strong instructions. I really didn't give them any room at all. They
                    knew war was coming. Another episode. A ship captain in New Orleans called. He
                    said, âThere's a group of men who hired my boat to go to Dominica to take over
                    the island. What should I do about it?â We informed the FBI. A couple of days
                    passed, and the captain called back; âThese guys are coming aboard tomorrow
                    night, we're leaving. Are you going to do anything about it?â We had not gotten
                    any results from the FBI. We sent a telegram to the director of the FBI. It went
                    out over the Secretary's name. That galvanized the Bureau. The Bureau, along
                    with the local police, the state police, and AID surrounded the boat and caught
                    ten thugs who aimed to overthrow the government. They were arrested. I sent a
                    message to the prime minister of Dominica, Eugenia Charles, to inform her. She
                    picked up information in Dominica that the opposition party was involved. There
                    had been wiretaps and other information out of Antigua to indicate, indirectly
                    at least, that the opposition was involved. So she called me and said, âRob,
                    I've got to have more information about this.â I said, âWell, I'll be glad to
                    tell you everything I know. It's not a lot.â</p>
                <p>She said, âI'm flying up to New York. Come up to New York and meet me. We'll have
                    dinner together and you can give me everything you know.â She tried to prosecute
                    the ring leaders, but she just didn't have enough evidence. But she did
                    discredit the opposition. There was enough suspicion. It was an intriguing
                    little story. Charles became an ardent supporter of the Reagan Administration.
                    She took many courageous, principled stands and gained international attention.
                    I had another incident. Baby Doc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Baby Doc Duvalier of Haiti.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Baby Doc was going to close down a radio station and suppress the free
                    press. The Department sent me to tell him that this was a no-go proposition. We
                    would take great exception if he closed down his free radio stations. The
                    ambassador and I saw him. There was no other Haitian there. JusBaby Doc and the
                    two of us. And I gave him the message (in my rather limited French, but I was
                    able to get it across) and told him that he was putting our relationship at risk
                    if he closed down the radio station. He didn't say a word. He just looked at us.
                    He was behind this massive desk and I was afraid he couldn't hear us. He got the
                    message. The radio station was never closed. The Caribbean was turbulent. The
                    aftermath of the coup iGrenada. A left wing group of thugs took over. An
                    insurrection and coup in Suriname. Drug trafficking and corruption in the
                    Bahamas. Insurrection and instability in Guyana. There was something popping up
                    every week. It was just an amazing Desk.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened in Guyana?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>WARNE: In Guyana, as you know, Cheddi Jagan, during the Kennedy White House, was
                    considered to be a Communist. He was certainly a fellow traveler, if not a
                    Communist. I didn't know any of the real inside story. It's come out recently in
                    the press that the CIA did do some things against Jagan. But my role essentially
                    was trying to urge more democratic and open-minded government and an improved
                    relationship with Guyana. This was after Jonestown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jonestown being where some 900 followers of the Reverend
                        Jim Jones committed mass suicide.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: I went to Guyana a couple of times, once on a speaking trip to reinforce
                    the U.S. role of trying to help. We had a modest aid program. My main role, in
                    all those islands and small countries, was to bring a more concerted aid program
                    together. I worked closely with the World Bank, through a consortium of donor
                    and recipient countries. The IMF, examined each country's economy, what they
                    could do to stabilize the economy. The donors committed aid, on a multilateral
                    basis to help to revive the economies. In about half of them we made substantial
                    progress. We did quite a bit. We were not successful in Guyana. The Guyanese
                    were not willing to take the adjustment measures necessary to stabilize the
                    economy and improve the investment climate. The situation deteriorated and the
                    US role was marginalized. We were making some major progress in Suriname, with
                    Dutch help (the Dutch were the leaders of it), when the whole thing blew up. A
                    Sergeant took over the government.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he was sort of a bï¿½te noire. How about iSuriname?

                <p>WARNE: Yes, it was. And our ambassador, who was an American woman...</p>

                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Yes. Poor woman, she was really isolated in that situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think she even had a DCM.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>WARNE: She took refuge, really. There was a head of state, and he gave her
                    protection. I never was fully satisfied with the way we handled that. There
                    wasn't a lot we could do. We obviously were not going to intervene. We couldn't
                    get the Dutch to intervene. We cut off our aid. We put out a statement, putting
                    faith in the democratic process. It was a mistake for a group to take over the
                    government. We urged a return to democratic, constitutional norms. The economic
                    situation deteriorated. US companies had a major financial stake in a bauxite
                    mine there. I worked with Alcoa, as well as with the Dutch, to keep that
                    operation going. Through our embassy in The Netherlands we coordinated a joint
                    approach. The Dutch never had the courage, I thought. They had the resources.
                    The Surinamese were dependent on their aid. The military government persisted
                    for years and disrupted a stable, relatively prosperous society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really, the reverse would have been true with the French,
                        who would...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Have just marched in and cleaned it up. And the Dutch weren't going to do
                    that. I actually went to the Netherlands on one occasion to talk to them
                    personally about it. But I never had a success. And I don't think our
                    administration had the backbone to do anything, which was unfortunate. I think,
                    if we had been more forceful early on, we might have nipped that coup in the
                    bud. And Suriname's gone downhill ever since. It's still struggling under those
                    problems. It was very unfortunate.</p>
                <p>I had a couple of other situations. I had a real problem in Antigua at one time,
                    and had a few minor problems and other insurrections.</p>
                <p>Through that experience, we cooked up the CBI (Caribbean Basin Initiative). Phil
                    Habib asked me to join him on a trip through the islands. And we put a proposal
                    to Vance about how we needed to make a more concerted effort, that here were our
                    neighbors that were going downhill, that they were all, for the most part,
                    democratic and open, but were impoverished, and what we could do to help them
                    out. And that was the seed of the CBI, which I subsequently, in another tour,
                    administered for a couple of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Reagan administration came in, what were the
                        atmospherics in ARA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Well, the atmospherics were terrible, in a couple of ways. One is that the
                    secretary demanded that we take a very strong line on Cuba. Cuba was not within
                    my area, but it dominated much of the ARA effort. But we never knew quite what
                    to do. I can remember the acting assistant secretary, after they just swept out
                    the rest of the Bureau, calling in all of the Latin American ambassadors and
                    saying, âWe won't tolerate what's going on in Cuba. We expect change.â But we
                    never said what the hell we were going to do if they didn't change. It was just
                    a bluff. And it was a mistake; we should have never said it, because we weren't
                    going to carry through. Everyone knew we weren't going to go to war with Cuba.
                    It was silly.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>So it was a very hostile period. And that was true with Grenada, too. As I said,
                    I took a very stern line on Grenada. I can remember our ambassador in
                    Bridgetown, Sonny [Sally Angela Shelton], made a request to go over and say her
                    farewells to the Grenadian authorities. She'd gotten dumped after Reagan came
                    in. And the instructions came back and said, âDon't go near the place. We don't
                    want to have any friends with them at all.â So we didn't really know what was
                    going on.</p>
                <p>Certainly, Seaga got whatever he wanted, and some of the other countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is one of these sort of political things,
                        particularly when a new administration comes in, where some sort of darlings
                        reflect what they want, and particularly if they happen to be new on the
                        scene, too, are picked up. Were you there when Grenada was invaded?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: No, I wasn't. Let me jump over that, because it was a rather interesting
                    story.</p>
                <p>I was the DCM in Jamaica at the time Grenada was invaded. Actually, we had a new
                    ambassador. I'd been chargï¿½ for about six months, and a new man had just been in
                    the job for a couple of months. The embassy was cut out of the Grenada
                    preparations, for the most part.</p>
                <p>Seaga went down to a meeting in Bridgetown and made a commitment, at that time,
                    to send Jamaican military forces in to help out in the invasion, so it could be
                    a multinational force.</p>
                <p>We were never given any advice as to what these arrangements were, and we never
                    knew when the invasion was going to be. But it was evident that it was going to
                    be coming that night. There were enough press reports; BBC, particularly, was
                    carrying reports of U.S. troops and ships building up around Grenada. I can
                    remember, on several occasions, various ambassadors coming in and wanting me to
                    brief them on this or that. And this was all I had; I just drew on press
                    reports.</p>
                <p>So that night of the invasion, I asked our communicator to stay in, and I stayed
                    in the embassy. I asked the military attachï¿½ to join me.</p>
                <p>The prime minister called me, about five o'clock, and said, âRob, we think
                    tonight's the night. Will you be sure to let me know when you want me to fly my
                    troops down.â</p>
                <p>I said, âMr. Prime Minister, I'll be glad to tell what I can. But I don't know
                    anything about what's going on.â</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>So I sent a flash message to Washington, saying that Seaga had just contacted me
                    and said that he had a problem. And that was that he had only one Air Jamaica
                    plane that was large enough to fly a company and a half or something of troops
                    down with their equipment. He had been keeping them there at the airport for the
                    last several nights, and they needed to service the airplane. He needed guidance
                    right away as to whether they could pull the plane off the line and service it.
                    I said, I just didn't know what to say to him. So I sent this flash message,
                    saying would you please give me guidance on what's happening and what I should
                    tell the prime minister.</p>
                <p>I waited about an hour and a half, and I got no reply. So I called the Operations
                    Center. We didn't have a secure line at that time, and I just said, âI sent you
                    a message not long ago. Could you send me a reply back.â Seaga had been calling
                    me on the half hour.</p>
                <p>The guy I got hold of switched me over to the task force in the Operations
                    Center. And they bawled the hell out of me. They said, âYou had no business
                    calling us in the open like this! Don't do it again!â Bang.</p>
                <p>I didn't know what the hell to do, so I sent another flash message, and I said,
                    âPlease give me advice.â</p>
                <p>And it went on like this all night. Never an inkling.</p>
                <p>In the morning, just as the sun was rising, there was a BBC report saying that
                    troops were landing on Grenada.</p>
                <p>The prime minister called me and said, âI don't want to ever talk to you again.
                    You son of a bitch, you have just destroyed me. I made such a commitment here,
                    and you cut me out. You son of a bitch.â</p>
                <p>I didn't know what to do. I just felt terrible.</p>
                <p>Do you know what Seaga said? He said, âI don't give a damn what you're going to
                    do. I'm going to send my troops down.â And he sent them over to the airport.</p>
                <p>I said to the defense attachï¿½, âWhat the hell are we going to do now?â</p>
                <p>And he said, âI'm going to send an open message to my counterpart in Barbados and
                    say he's got a package on the way.â And he did.</p>
                <p>The Jamaican troops landed on Grenada on the second day. Seaga called it a great
                    victory.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>He called snap elections and won all the seats in the parliament. Of course, the
                    opposition refused to run, because they said that this was intervention in the
                    internal affairs of another country and so forth. But Seaga and the Jamaican
                    people were overwhelmed with victory.</p>
                <p>They just strictly cut me out of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave your time in ARA, what about some of the
                        personalities at the top? Was Tom Enders there when you were there, most of
                        the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Tom Enders was there for part of the time. And then Bill Bowdler was
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been there before, and he was summarily...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Kicked out. Tom was there just at the start of the administration. He was
                    very good. I really enjoyed the way he ran the Bureau. He was very swift and
                    clear. And no writing memos. Decisions were made, bang, with Steve Bosler, who
                    was the principal. And then, after that, Elliott Abrams. I enjoyed Elliott.
                    Elliott was a very good administrator. I don't think a lot of people give him
                    credit for his managerial skills. He has a very keen intellect. I admired all
                    three of the bosses. But my principal person that I worked with during most of
                    that time was John Bushnell.</p>
                <p>I am confusing periods, I've got to admit. I was in the Bureau for a stretch of
                    several years. I joined the Bureau, as I said, in '81 [sic], and during that
                    period, there was Bill Bowdler, at first. And then I left to go down to Jamaica
                    in '81. When I came back, it was Bowdler, Enders, and then Elliott Abrams.</p>

                <p>WARNE: Our relations were very good. The first year was a very good year, because
                    I had an old, seasoned, career ambassador to work with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Loren Lawrence, a very affable and friendly guy, whose main mission in
                    life was to get along with Seaga. And he did that very well. Seaga used him very
                    well.</p>
                <p>I'm not sure that all was in our interest, to be honest. I think there were sides
                    of Seaga that became more apparent as we went along. He was not a good manager.
                    I think probably there were some aspects of him that we didn't fully appreciate,
                    on the corruption and ruthless side. But certainly we were committed to him.</p>
                <p>Despite all of our aid, the country didn't turn around. If anything, it was
                    depressed. He had some bad shots. He had the depressed bauxite. The difficulties
                    of criminality and theft against tourists hurt him. But he didn't manage the
                    situation nearly as well as he thought.</p>
                <p>He was a very arrogant and difficult person to work with, in some ways. But Lorie
                    got along with him superbly. And, as chargï¿½, I got along with him well. I had a
                    stint of more than six months. But it was during a terrible time of a drought,
                    and they really didn't have any water for parts of the city. Seaga asked me to
                    do an emergency program to bring water in.</p>
                <p>We had a large AID program. We built up our AID mission very, very rapidly there.
                    Probably we were not well oriented in our AID program, and I don't think it was
                    a great success, to be honest.</p>
                <p>And then we brought in Bill Hewitt, who was the former CEO of Deere and Company,
                    who had never had any governmental experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Agricultural and farm...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Equipment. Bill was a very fine guy, but was just not the right person to
                    be an ambassador. He just didn't have, I didn't think, much in the way of
                    political intake. It was an unfortunate match, I thought. But he did his best to
                    get along with Seaga. He was very committed.</p>
                <p>But he resented me very much in my relationships that I had developed with the
                    opposition, which subsequently came into power. In fact, once, he told me he was
                    going to get me for meeting with the opposition.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This sometimes happens, particularly with political
                        appointees, who don't really understand the long run.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Not only that, but feel that you're not being correct in your handling of
                    diplomacy, to meet with the opposition. But Seaga understood. He never called me
                    down for it. In fact, I was quite open with him. And Seaga shared a lot of
                    confidences with me.</p>
                <p>In fact, one time, I was really chagrined. Hewitt had to go to Japan just at the
                    time when Seaga decided to hold his snap election. He ordered me, before he
                    left, not to tell the Department about all these plans and everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That he was going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: No, no, that Seaga was going to have his snap election, and he was going
                    to redo the government, and how he was going to deal with the opposition and so
                    forth. It was almost anti-democratic, what happened. I said, âWell, Bill, what
                    can I do?â</p>
                <p>And he said, âWell, if you really feel you have to send a message, here are my
                    numbers in Tokyo. Call me and I will assess it.â</p>
                <p>So I called him in Tokyo, and I said, âI really feel the situation has gotten to
                    the point where I have to tell the Department.â</p>
                <p>He wouldn't let me do it.</p>
                <p>He had worked out an arrangement with the station chief, and the station chief
                    was doing the reporting. So I essentially got cut out of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very serious, of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: When I got back to Washington, I told the Department that I really was
                    upset with the way that was handled. And they said, âWell, we knew what was
                    going on. It didn't make that much difference.â My political section, obviously,
                    was really distraught, but what could I do?</p>
                <p>So I think Bill didn't really have confidence in the State Department; not only
                    me, but the whole political section, and maybe some of the economic section. He
                    just felt that maybe we were too open or we didn't know how to protect secrets
                    or whatever.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, there can be this fascination with the CIA station
                        chief. It's enticing to feel that you really are...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: In the know?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the know. And, of course, it was an era of William
                        Casey being the head, and the Republican administration was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: They cooked up one idea that I really strongly opposed, and that was,
                    Casey was going to come down and visit Seaga. And I said, âThere's no way you
                    can do that. This would be a serious mistake. There's no way you could cover it
                    up. If it ever got out that he'd been down here, and he'd been that close to the
                    CIA, it would damage everybody.â</p>
                <p>No, I had a very difficult time. Bill asked me to stay on for another year, but I
                    just found it an unworkable situation. He let me run the embassy. I did all the
                    work during that Seaga era. He was home during the time when we did the Grenada
                    thing.</p>
                <p>I had one political officer, who was not a leftist, but was sort of open minded,
                    who was sleeping, maybe, with the editor of the newspaper or something. And the
                    Agency got on her back a little bit. But I never felt that she was confiding
                    secrets to anybody or anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, boy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Boy, I had some tough ones. But Seaga and I got along well. I mean, he's
                    still a good friend of mine. We trade letters and cards. But I didn't trust
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you came back and did what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: I was the director of the Economic Bureau, the Economic Office in Latin
                    America, for two- plus years. And I ran the CBI program for State, and also did
                    a lot of economic work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: That was from '84 to '86. My main effort was on Central America. That was
                    under Elliott Abrams. I did a lot of work in putting together what was then
                    called the Kissinger Plan for economic development.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Kissinger Plan a real plan, or was he dragged in
                        as a sort of sideshow for pursuing the Contra business and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: A little bit of both. It was a real plan, and we had a lot of aid effort.
                    But I never felt that we had the discipline in the use of that money to make a
                    difference. I was convinced that, if we were going to do a program, it would be
                    much like the one that we tried in the Caribbean, where we'd get the IMF and the
                    Bank involved, and we would do a thorough analysis and come up with a solid
                    action plan, where the governments had to make commitments to stabilize and to
                    open and to really rejuvenate their economies. That's what I argued about, and,
                    frankly, it just rolled right over the top of them. So I thought a lot of the
                    aid was misused. It was just a short-term payoff. But it was a very substantial
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the record, this is about the conflict with Nicaragua,
                        essentially.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Well, Salvador, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was the left versus the right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: And it was trying to contain the Contras and also to prevent the
                    insurrection in Salvador from getting out of hand. I was handling sort of the
                    economic side of it with AID.</p>
                <p>Also, the Caribbean Basin Initiative was a big effort at that time, and we did
                    quite a bit. I went around and negotiated and settled agreements with all those
                    countries on CBI.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this Caribbean Initiative a real program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: It had a substantial program. The main thing was the preferential trade
                    arrangement. And I think it made a big impact. But it was a long-term program,
                    and it wasn't going to turn things around right away. It certainly helped
                    solidify our effort in the region, and we had congressional support for it. It
                    didn't make as big a difference as we hoped, because, frankly, it depended on
                    those countries' ability to organize their trade to take advantage of it, and a
                    lot of them were slow in responding, such as Jamaica.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>And then, finally, my last tour, I went to Paris. Actually, I did it as a last
                    choice. I wanted to leave the Bureau. I felt that I had had enough of working on
                    economic affairs, and I wanted to go overseas as a DCM or ambassador. At that
                    time, I was a minister-counselor, and had been a minister-counselor for three or
                    four years. I ran in competition for about six or seven DCM jobs, and I didn't
                    get one of them. And it finally came down to Caracas. They had a new ambassador,
                    not a career guy, and he chose a different candidate. So I decided to throw the
                    towel in.</p>
                <p>I took the job of economic counselor in Paris, as sort of a final assignment. I
                    was in Paris for two years as the man in charge of trade and agriculture and
                    energy and social affairs and labor affairs. I had a wonderful two years. My
                    family and I enjoyed it immensely.</p>
                <p>I was elected, among the 24 countries, as the chairman of the trade committee
                    working party and ran the preparations for the Uruguay Round, which was very
                    exciting. We developed some new guidelines for services and for investment and
                    intellectual property protection. It made a substantial contribution to the
                    Round. Got some new guidelines, which developed into the final agreement on
                    agriculture. So we did a lot during those two years.</p>
                <p>But I had decided to get out of the Foreign Service. I decided that, since I
                    wasn't going to be an ambassador and I couldn't even get a good DCM job, I ought
                    to go do something else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in Paris, what was your attitude towards the
                        French and how they viewed us anhow we dealt with it? It always seems to be
                        a stormy relationship. Very interesting letter from the French ambassador in
                        thpaper today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: I saw it. I thought it was well written. I enjoyed it. I had no resentment
                    against the French. I enjoy the French. They're wonderful people. I had a lot of
                    good French friends.</p>
                <p>In fact, I had an interesting experience in France. Suzy was here in Washington
                    to take care of our daughter's wedding preparations. This was during the time
                    when there were lot of French terrorist bombing activities. They identified our
                    apartment as a place where an American diplomat was living. And they just one
                    day called me up and said I couldn't go home, that this was a threat. I said,
                    âWhat do you want me to do?â</p>
                <p>He said, âGet out of town and go stay in a hotel.â</p>
                <p>So I called a French friend and asked if I could go stay with him in Nice. He had
                    an apartment. So I spent ten days with him down there, and I had a wonderful
                    time.</p>
                <p>We still have three or four French friends that stop by. No, I didn't find any
                    problem with the French at all.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Ed Streator was our ambassador to the OECD.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were with the OECD.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: I was at the OECD, yes. And then the last year was Dennis Lamb. Two
                    entireldifferent personalities.</p>
                <p>The OECD was a fascinating place, and it's been very useful. In fact, I just got
                    back from a week at the OECD, where I looked up a lot of the old people I worked
                    with. I did an audit of the Korean effort to get into the OECD, and found that
                    it's even a more vital organization for U.S. interests today than when I was
                    there. It's a sleeper. A lot of people don't know much about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain, what is the OECD?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: The OECD is a group of 25 countries that have structured themselves to
                    look at international economic issues and collaborate together in dealing with
                    these issues. It's an outgrowth of the Marshall Plan, in which, just after the
                    war, as you know, the U.S. helped with the reconstruction of Europe. And coming
                    out of that was the OECD. It was originally a community which the U.S. planned
                    to coordinate the aid effort, the purpose of which was that we agreed that we
                    would provide substantial financial aid if the Europeans would, in turn,
                    structure their economies to revitalize their industry and reconstruct the
                    war-torn countries. And the OECD was the framework for the aid program.</p>
                <p>Well, it evolved from a major bilateral aid effort to a collaborative effort to
                    manage the world economy, mainly focused in Europe, but throughout the world.
                    And it now has about 16 major directors, handling everything from trade to
                    environment to finance to education to social affairs, labor, industry, and all
                    of the major areas of economic activity, globally. Its purpose is to try to
                    identify emerging problems and to develop, first, an analytical basis for the
                    ways to deal with the problems, and then, secondly, to come up with
                    recommendations and then proposals for governments to take in the way of policy
                    actions. For example, there are five issues that I was dealing with when I was
                    in Paris this last week.</p>
                <p>I can give you examples of the things. One is what to do about the stagnant and
                    large unemployment in Europe and, somewhat, in the United States, what policy
                    measures to be taken in the way of training, revitalizing the economies to
                    generate more employment.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Another issue that they're dealing with is the aging population in a number of
                    the member countries. The population of Belgium is projected to decline by ten
                    percent over the next decade. What are the economic consequences of these
                    demographic changes, and how do you cope with them?</p>
                <p>A third area that I was dealing with was a new initiative to open up investment
                    worldwide. We're negotiating a new investment instrument that would have a much
                    higher discipline for countries in handling foreign direct investment.</p>
                <p>A fourth area was how to restructure the International Energy Agency to better
                    cope with the changing oil situation, particularly on how to help develop oil in
                    the Caspian Sea and in Russia.</p>
                <p>A fifth area was concerning new guidelines for environmental issues. How should
                    trade negotiators take environmental concerns into account, and the impact on
                    the environment of expanding trade and new trade opportunities. We're working
                    out some new guidelines.</p>
                <p>These are the types of issues. They're very nitty gritty things that a lot of
                    people don't pay a lot of attention to, but are important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is the sort of thing that I'm trying to bring
                        out in these oral histories. Foreign relations aren't just coups and
                        elections and things like this, but underlying it is a tremendous economic
                        web, where the United States plays a leading role in trying to meet crises.
                        And this is what we're getting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Well, for example, during the time I was at the OECD, my main interest was
                    trying to get a consensus among the major trading countries of the world of what
                    we wanted to do in the Uruguay Round trade negotiations to restructure our trade
                    relations. We were, for the first time, advocating that we should have
                    discipline on investment that all of us could agree to: national treatment,
                    right of establishment, of transparency, of rules.</p>
                <p>Another area was on intellectual property protection. What should be the
                    copyright rules, and how could they be standardized worldwide to protect U.S.
                    companies and others from invasion of their copyrights.</p>
                <p>And then a third area, for the first time, we were taking up services â
                    accounting, business services, financial services worldwide â and what
                    disciplines could be established in this new area that is now the most important
                    part of our trade. It's the most important part of our economy, and we don't
                    have any international disciplines in these areas.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>We were able to adopt, in the working group that I was chairing, a consensus. And
                    we worked at it very hard. I had a mandate. Every week I would be putting
                    forward a new paper and a new proposal, and we would dialogue about it, and we
                    would get countries to react to it, and then we'd draw up some guidelines. I had
                    a steady stream of people from Washington that would participate in this. We had
                    people from USTR, primarily, that would come out and help me in the preparation
                    of this. And we got a very good working framework out of the 24 countries, which
                    we submitted to the Geneva negotiations, which were the basis for these
                    agreements. So the OECD played a very good catalytic role in getting this
                    Round.</p>
                <p>We did the same on agriculture. We analyzed the cost of subsidies on all the
                    major commodities, and we compared the amount of subsidies among each country,
                    and then began to create a framework for how these subsidies could be reduced.
                    We got a very substantial first step, not a final step, in an agricultural
                    agreement out of the Rounds.</p>
                <p>So, yes, we made quite an impact on it. And, as a result, trade will expand
                    substantially in Western Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rob, I want to thank you very much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WARNE: Well, Stu, we wound it up.</p>
