                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: October 21, 1997</p>
                <p>Copyright 2000 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: Today is October 21, 1997. I am Charles Stuart Kennedy and this is being done
                    on behalf of The Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training. I wonder if
                    you could give me something about when and where you were born and something
                    about your family.</p>
                <p>ROGERS: Sure. I was born on October 21, 1931 in Troy, New York, exactly 66 years
                    to this day of interview (across the street from Terry McNamara). My mother was
                    born in upstate New York the village of New Baltimore immediately south of
                    Albany. My father, born in Troy, was a highly decorated veteran of World War I.
                    He was wounded at Belleau Wood, the famous battle, about 40 miles east of Paris.
                    It was the turning point for the allies, and the first major commitment of U.S.
                    troops in combat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he in the Marines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: He was in the U.S. Army Artillery. The Marines then had no artillery, so
                    the 12 Field Artillery Battery D was assigned to assist the Marine Corps at
                    Belleau Wood. My mother was a homemaker. I had one brother, who died five years
                    ago at the age of 65. My mother died at age 50, when I was 13, and my father at
                    age 58, when I was 22 and serving in the Navy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of business was your father in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: He was a clerk in the Railway Mail Service (RMS). He rode trains
                    delivering the mail and eventually became the head of RMS for a part of the
                    Northeast headquartered in Albany, where he supervised the mail trains.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was quite a center between trains coming out of New
                        Englanand going out to the West and up to Canada.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: That's right. It was a big mail hub. He enjoyed it vermuch. Sadly, he
                    never got to retire. He died before he retired.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give me a bit about your home life - family, books
                        yoread, things of that nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: We didn't have too many books, but we had a few. I wanted to read more
                    and I asked my father when I was about eight, “What is a good book to read?” He
                    said, “Start with the Bible.” I did. I still read in that arena a good deal. In
                    fact, once upon a time, I was planning to become a Presbyterian missionary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about school? Where did you go to school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: A small public high school in upstate New York in the middle of the
                    Hudson River near Troy. I was president of the class both junior and senior
                    years, president of the student council and of an association of all the high
                    school student councils in the Troy region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were sort of a politician as a young lad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were very much a child of the Depression. ROGERS: Oh,
                        yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Troy was not a particularly affluent area. What is
                        youimpression of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: I remember, we were considered very fortunate because my father had a
                    job. Many did not. Troy had a lot of labor intensive manufacturing work, trolley
                    cars, horseshoes, buggy whips, and detachable shirt collars. A lot of things
                    that were suddenly not in need, which made it worse in the Depression era. I can
                    remember as a youngster people coming to our door and my father giving them food
                    as they would pass through trying to find work. I have vivid memories of a lot
                    of terribly hungry men with tools walking through looking for work.</p>
                <p>Q: These were the people who were getting on the trains as hobos. In high school,
                    did you get any feel for foreign affairs or anything like that?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: I was keenly interested in World War II. As a child, I mapped every
                    battle with great detail with flag pins. I was fascinated with that. We had
                    blackouts, of course. I was constantly aware of submarine warfare on the East
                    Coast. There were tremendous losses in shipping. Some of my uncles were in the
                    Merchant Marine and the Navy. We had the closest association with the Navy.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get, as I did, an unexcelled sense of geography
                        froWorld War II?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Oh, absolutely. I was fascinated with geography. I used to draw maps of
                    the world just to fully understand where everything fit. I recall complaining to
                    a high school teacher, “Why don't you teach us more geography?” She said, “Well,
                    why bother? After the war, all the maps will be changed.” I don't think she
                    displayed much of a historical sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in high school, did you learn at all about
                        thForeign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: I had never heard of it. I didn't know it existed probabluntil I was in
                    the Navy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you graduate from high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: In 1949.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: I went to Ohio State University. I majored in social work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What pushed you towards social work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: I think the earlier Christian studies and a great compassion for the
                    downtrodden and the hopeless, maybe from the Depression and seeing all that
                    suffering. I undertook a term of residence at a southern California
                    penitentiary, the California Institution for Men. I was also glad to be in the
                    Naval ROTC. It was a great way to see the world. I then actually planned
                    eventually to stay in the Navy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated in 1953. Did you go right into the
                        Navy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Immediately, on graduation day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about in college, was there any feeling of the world
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>ROGERS: Oh, yes. We were keenly aware of the war in Korea. Many of my
                    contemporaries went to Korea and never came back - all through high school and
                    college. In those days, if your grades weren't adequate, you were gone. I did
                    not want to be a soldier, pardon the expression. I knew that would be very hard
                    for me. Everyone had to take some kind of military training. Because of our
                    family's Navy background on my mother's side, I decided to apply to the Naval
                    ROTC and did get in. I enjoyed it very much and learned a lot. Just a couple of
                    days after graduation, I was off to serve. My father had suffered much in the
                    trenches in WWI, and therefore encouraged me toward the Navy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to get your initial training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: The NROTC training lasts four years during college and five hours a week
                    plus a summer cruise. That's it. No boot camp. No officer's training course. One
                    was commissioned on graduation day. We had our caps and gowns on and then we
                    took off our caps and gowns and there we were in our officer uniforms. We were
                    sworn in on the spot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: My first assignment was the aircraft carrier Roosevelt. I went directly
                    to it. I picked it up in southern France, in Marseille. In order to get there, I
                    had to spend a few days in Morocco. So, my first real foreign stop (other than
                    Canada as a child) was Morocco, which turned out to be my last Foreign Service
                    assignment 32 years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Roosevelt was at that time one of the newer carriers.
                        Whawere you doing on board?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: I was a gunnery officer. I had applied for naval aviation training.
                    Normally, we would have some sea duty before going to training duty just to get
                    a basic understanding of how a ship functioned. If you're going to fly off of
                    them, it is helpful to know how they run. So, I was there for several months and
                    my orders to Pensacola arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Pensacola from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: A very short time. I got there, went through pre-flight school, and
                    before any significant aviation work, we all had to take another physical, which
                    I failed. My vision had fallen below acceptable limits. They discovered that I
                    had a serious defect of judging relative motion (depth perception), which would
                    be very dangerous.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly for flying on and off carriers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: I kept bumping into things. So, they said, “It was nice of you to try,
                    but we don't want you to kill yourself or anybody else.” I was transferred
                    immediately to Korea and a shore unit in Pusan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was 1953. So, the war was still on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Korea from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: I would say October 1953 to April 1954.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Pusan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: I was in a small organization called the Military Sea Transportation
                    Service. We were the cargo and troop transport unit that serviced all the armed
                    forces, mostly the Army, but the Marine Corps as well. We planned all their
                    movements. We lived in Pusan itself on a barracks ship LST (landing ship tank).
                    It was not very comfortable, but we were so young that we didn't care. We looked
                    after the movement of everything from troops to dead bodies. One of my most
                    vivid memories was taking on a load of green rubber bodybags of hundreds of our
                    dead servicemen to be shipped out of Pusan. It was labeled “Operation Glory.”
                    These were very interesting times. During that time, the city of Pusan burned to
                    the ground. There was almost nothing there. There were masses of refugees and it
                    was a very hard life for them. The same organization, MSTS, had several units in
                    Japan (Yokohama, Kobe, Fukuoka, and Hokkaido) because shipment from the U.S.
                    often was shipped through Japan or back again.</p>
                <p>So, my next assignment following Korea was to Yokohama, Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with the Korean navy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Yes, every day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>ROGERS: I knew some naval and marine officers. They were all very patriotic and
                    determined not to let their little country be overrun by the North Koreans under
                    Russian and Chinese influence. I had some trouble with stevedores, who tended to
                    run away when you weren't looking, but they were just young kids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you feeling any of the residue when Syngman Rhee
                        released great many prisoners, North Korean and Chinese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: One of the projects of my unit was to look after an operation where we
                    sent thousands of captured mainland Chinese communist troops who wanted to go to
                    Taiwan instead of back to China - thousands - just shiploads. They came from the
                    Kojido and Chejudo camps, relatively small islands near Pusan where there were
                    vast prisoner camps.</p>
                <p>Q: Rhee didn't release the Chinese. It was the North Koreans that he released.
                    This caused great anguish on the part of the Americans because we had worked up
                    a swap deal with the North Koreans. Syngman Rhee had released the Korean
                    prisoners, which sort of forced our hand.</p>
                <p>ROGERS: Yes, but I was only directly involved in shipping thmainland Chinese to
                    Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern as to whether or not they were going
                        willingly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: I was convinced... They were delighted not to go back into China and then
                    back into battle, or be punished for getting captured. There was a Chinese
                    nationalist group there that talked with them. They gave them tee shirts with
                    patriotic slogans. They were delighted to get out of Korea. What happened to
                    them when they got to Taiwan, I don't know. I suppose that they were very
                    carefully monitored for a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As far as I know, the amalgamation worked fairly
                        well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You were in Japan from when to when?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: Part of 1954 and 1955, just about a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>ROGERS: The same thing. One of the most interesting things was that we loaded a
                    lot of Marines, thousands of them, on troop transports. They were going to go to
                    Vietnam and relieve the French at the siege of Dien Bien Phu. They were
                    literally on board the transports when we got the order that it was over. Dien
                    Bien Phu had fallen. We marched them all ashore. They were pleased.</p>
                <p>Q: I know because I was in the Air Force in Germany at that time. I had served in
                    Korea during the war. The word was that we weren't going to be released because
                    we were going to go into Vietnam, a place I had never heard of.</p>
                <p>ROGERS: It was very serious. They were really going to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in Japan, was there a difference between
                        thKoreans and the Japanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: There was a lot of animosity. I was interested in Korea. I tried to talk
                    to Japanese about Korea and Korean things. They didn't want to hear about it.
                    You were talking about the second class former colonial people. Of course, Japan
                    had been in Korea in colonial occupation about 42 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, they had been there just after the turn of the
                        century anhad a very brutal occupation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: I didn't particularly like Korean food, but I liked Japanese food. Of
                    course, in Japan, there was much more to do even though much of Yokohama was
                    still burned out from WWII. All the residences were just flat for many blocks as
                    far as one could see. Nonetheless, it was safe and, thus, you could get out and
                    enjoy the sites. I became very interested in Kabuki. I still go to Kabuki every
                    time I'm in Japan.</p>
                <p>Q: This was a period where one kind of wondered who won and who lost the war. The
                    Japanese culture certainly absorbed most of the Americans who went over there
                    and served in Japan.</p>
                <p>ROGERS: The music was interesting, as were all of the theater arts, Kabuki and
                    Bunraku puppets, even the Noh plays, which I never understood, but were very
                    stately and dignified. They are highly educated, cultured people.</p>

                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>ROGERS: The summer of 1955. Interestingly enough, you asked if I knew about the
                    Foreign Service. There was a fellow naval officer in Pusan whose brother was in
                    the Foreign Service. Spengler was his name. He told me what a great life he
                    had.</p>
                <p>On the small Army compound where we lived in Yokohama, there was a group of Army
                    officers, mostly engineers. My quonset hut, which I shared with three Army
                    officers, was across the street from the dining hall. I was there one day and I
                    heard these two men talking. They sounded so interesting. I thought, “This must
                    be an elite Army unit.” I asked, “What kind of an outfit are you in?” They
                    sounded so intelligent, so full of knowledge compared to the average Army person
                    I knew. It turned out that this was the consul general of the U.S. in Yokohama
                    and one of his staff. They spent an hour talking to me about the Foreign
                    Service. I never looked back. I decided: that's for me. That would combine my
                    interest in international affairs, my humanitarian instincts, my interest in
                    culture, and my desire to contribute to the national service. I also knew that
                    in peacetime, short, chubby democrats wouldn't go far in the U.S. Navy. But one
                    might in the Foreign Service, I hoped.</p>
                <p>Q: What sort of active thing did you do? You heard these Foreign Service officers
                    talking and discussed it, but then how did you go about making this career
                    change?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: I took one exam in Tokyo, I think more out of trying to understand what
                    it was all about than anything else. I know I didn't pass. I forget what my
                    score was. I don't remember if they told us or not. I said, “Well, that's okay.
                    I can do that. I'll study some more.” In order to tune my mind up while waiting
                    to try to get into the Foreign Service, I went to law school. I applied to
                    several, and was accepted at all. I decided eventually to attend George
                    Washington University Law School because it was near the State Department. I had
                    a backup plan that if I didn't get into the Foreign Service (and I knew the odds
                    were slight), I would have a law degree. I was still a naval reserve officer (I
                    later became a lieutenant commander.). Thus, I could return to the Navy as a
                    lawyer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in law school at George Washington from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: I graduated in May 1958, 11 months after I entered the Foreign Service. I
                    went to law school 12 months a year day and night, and finished up the balance
                    at night school.</p>
                <p>Q: You took the Foreign Service Written Exam twice and passed the second time.
                    Then you took the Oral Exam. What do you remember about the Oral Exam?</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>ROGERS: It was charming. I think the chairman's name was Herbert Bursley. He had
                    been an ambassador. It was on Pennsylvania Avenue in a building that still
                    exists across from the World Bank. They were very pleasant. They asked me about
                    the Navy and what my interests were. They gave me some questions, I suppose, to
                    see not only my depth of knowledge but also my ability to reason and to defend a
                    position. They told me on the spot that I had been accepted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular questions or problems that they
                        sebefore you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: I don't remember. It was so long ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't ask you about what rivers flow through Kansas
                        osomething like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: I don't remember that, but I was very good in history and geography, so I
                    could have handled that, pretty much anything like that. They asked me some
                    questions about art and music of all things and I happened to know those. It was
                    not too difficult. I think they were just looking for persons that would be
                    committed to national service more than knowledge of obscure things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: This was in 1956. It took approximately eight to 12 months to enter on
                    duty. I remember, when I passed, I was offered a commission as FSO-6. I got a
                    phone call months later. It was decided that FSO-6 was going to be FSO-8. Do you
                    object? I said, “I don't really know the difference.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that at that time that was just about the time
                        theswitched from a 06 ranking system to an 08 ranking system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: That is exactly right. I had many friends who went in four or five months
                    earlier who had an FSO-6, but were lowered to FSO-7. I think we never really
                    “caught up” with that group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took the A-100 course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: At Arlington Towers.</p>

                        thtraining at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: It was a lot of fun. We were a bit rebellious. The men almost all had
                    military service, nine out of 10. Almost all were officers. There were many Air
                    Force pilots and naval officers. There were only three women in our class, a
                    very small proportion. Of that number, two former FS [Foreign Service]
                    secretaries. The third was killed on her first assignment in Algeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, how sad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: She was killed during a firefight between the French and rebels. Our
                    A-100 group was a lot of fun and there remain very dear and strong friendships.
                    Some of them are dead now. Ashley Cooper Hewitt comes to mind, a dear friend. He
                    died five years ago. One became a hostage in Teheran, Bob Blucher. When he was
                    interviewed after he got out, a newsman asked, “Mr. Blucher, would you like to
                    see Teheran again?” Blucher had been an Air Force pilot. He said, “Only through
                    a bomb site.” That was a great line. So, they were jolly fellows. We enjoyed
                    each other's company. We were all developing and learning at the same time. We
                    were from a variety of different backgrounds.</p>
                <p>Q: While you were taking this course, did you begin to get a feel for what field
                    you wanted, both geographic and specialty, which were the best places to go,
                    what to avoid, and that sort of thing?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: I wanted to take Japanese language training. That was the most
                    interesting exposure I had had up until that time. That never happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did they assign you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: They said, “You want to finish this law degree. That is going to take
                    another six to eight months. Why don't you just stay in the U.S. and finish that
                    up?” I worked for an organization that no longer exists called International
                    Educational Exchange Service (IEES). It eventually became part of USIA, but I
                    was only there for that short time. I married in June 1959.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you meet your wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: She was a nurse in Washington. Coincidentally, I was a patient in that
                    hospital and fell instantly in love. Two years later, we were married.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Yes. I think almost all of mine were in Latin America, educational
                    exchange on the professorial level and the technical expert level, just making
                    the arrangements. These were selected by committees. I was just a facilitator of
                    getting them organized and moved around and prepared. It was interesting, but
                    nothing fabulous.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do after you left IEES and got your law
                        degree?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: My first assignment (and I didn't go there) was Sapporo. When I told my
                    future wife (She was living with her parents.), “Well, I”m going to go to
                    Japan,” she said, “You're really going to go?” I said, “Sure, that's my job.
                    That's my duty.” She said, “Okay, then let's get married.” I had been asking her
                    for a long time. Her mother was very reticent. She said, “Wait a minute. This
                    guy doesn't have a real job. He's going to traipse all over the world like a
                    gypsy.” So, we were married. Two days later, I got a call saying, “Sorry about
                    that. You're going to Hong Kong instead. Somebody else will do Sapporo.” But
                    that was great. Suddenly, this vast China was out there. The history,
                    philosophy, and culture was so exciting, not to mention the cuisine. So, there
                    was another vast horizon of fun things to learn about and participate in. So,
                    there I was back on the rim of China, having served in Korea, Japan, and then
                    Hong Kong, as well as Macao.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: I would say approximately September 1959 to January 1961. Q: What type of
                    work were you doing there?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: Consular work and immigration fraud analysis. It was interesting, but
                    just being iHong Kong and being a part of that culture was fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me a bit about immigration and fraud

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>ROGERS: Briefly, when Chinese males were recruited, mostly from the Canton area,
                    to work on railroads and mines in the west in the 1860s and 1870s and on, each
                    time they would make a trip back and forth, they would register that they had a
                    son. There may very well have been no such son, but they would build these
                    phantom families for immigration purposes. They were called “slot sons.” So,
                    then, a relative or a person would buy that slot and migrate by derivative
                    citizenship and get to the U.S. illegally. So, the plan was to analyze whether
                    or not these people really were the persons they claimed to be. It was terribly
                    difficult. We had very elaborate methods, but I don't think many of them
                    worked.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Exactly right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were built up with great care. Almost everybody came
                        froreally a very small number of villages.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Right. It's called the Seyip, six counties, all around the area between
                    Canton city and Macao, a great triangle. I think I recall, 90% of Chinese
                    Americans up until 1945 were from that region. It's different now. But that was
                    fun and interesting. I was a little annoyed at what I felt to be a corrupt
                    practice of paying people to give what I believed were false statements. I would
                    never do that. I said, “Wait a minute. You're going to give this guy $5 Hong
                    Kong to tell me that this man isn't the person he claimed to be? He doesn't know
                    anything about it. We're not going to that.” That was just an evil practice. But
                    that was the system that sort of developed over the years. It was called the
                    Documents Verification Unit. So, I did that for two years. It was exciting and
                    interesting. I got around Hong Kong a great deal.</p>
                <p>Q: This Document Verification Center... This is really very important in the
                    immigration scheme of things. What was the feeling among the officers there?
                    These are a bunch of crooks and we've got to get them? Let's do the best we
                    can?</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>ROGERS: About half of the people involved in that had come from Europe, where
                    they were refugee officers who had been integrated into the Foreign Service, the
                    Refugee Relief Program (RRP). They were rather severe and unbelieving. I think
                    they had been doing this sort of thing too long and become jaded and
                    unsympathetic. I said, “Are we trying to find out the truth or keep people out?”
                    They said, “Keep people out.” Part of their task in Europe was not migration to
                    the U.S., but getting people back, if possible, to where they came from in
                    Europe before being dispersed by World War II - and if that place were no longer
                    available or safe, then migration elsewhere. But they were sort of police
                    oriented in that respect. A handful of young FSOs were also doing that. Some of
                    them became very famous. John Negroponte was one. Our consul general was a
                    wonderful person, Julius Cecil Holmes. We really loved him. He was a great guy,
                    was very kind to us. I made many lasting friendships there as well.</p>
                <p>Q: What were you getting and absorbing at the consulate from your interviews and
                    just getting around and about what was then known as communist China?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: Many of the people who came in were, indeed, border crossers who then
                    wanted to make this connection to go to the U.S. Some of them were of interest,
                    but we detailed them to the person in our unit who was from the CIA who
                    interviewed them. I was never in the room when that happened. He would decide
                    whether or not they had anything of merit or value or utility in his interview,
                    see what they could glean from it. Almost all of the illegal border crossers
                    were from that region, it being so difficult to move from one region of China to
                    another. We had one story which turned out to be not so that I always
                    remembered. One refugee said that the Polish consul in Canton wanted to defect.
                    That was very exciting. We would want to get in on that, get him through, and so
                    forth, but that didn't happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with the China watchers at that
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Oh, yes. Many of them worked their way up. Several of them became consul
                    general in Hong Kong eventually. Richard Williams was one of our colleagues. He
                    became later our first ambassador to Mongolia, although non-resident. Two or
                    three others became very, very active in China. At that time, there were not
                    very many assignments available for the Chinese language officers. There was one
                    position in Warsaw for a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an interpreter for the relations talks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Yes. Then, of course, Taiwan, but they probably were overproducing in
                    anticipation that eventually they would staff up in China. That did eventually
                    happen, at which time half those fellows were retired.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Q: Was there much discussion at that time within the Foreign Service people who
                    were sitting here on the outskirts of China proper talking about whether we
                    should or should not recognize them?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: I don't recall that. The Korean War hadn't been over that long. There was
                    a lot of concern about the militancy of China in other parts of East Asia and
                    the experience with Korea. There were still a lot missing from the Korean War.
                    Then, China in turn was going through one chaotic, crushing situation after
                    another, which made their whole system one of disorder, a great leap forward and
                    two behind, and a thousand flowers bloomed, that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Q: Also, during this period, in 1960, there was the debate between Kennedy and
                    Nixon over what to do about Quemoy and Matsu, the disputed islands between China
                    and Taiwan. Did that play out at all where you were?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: I don't recall that. No, it was just the great monolith, the great
                    concern of what they would do. There was hostility left over from the Korean
                    War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Vietnam raise any blips on your radar at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Mine personally, yes, for a very strange reason. I was an FSO-8 for five
                    years, because I was still on language probation. I was going to be terminated,
                    so I said, “I would rather really try again to pass this stupid French exam.”
                    So, I took annual leave, bought a ticket on a French ship called “The Laos,” and
                    sailed off to Saigon. This was prearranged with friends there. I stayed with a
                    wonderful teacher from Alliance Fran�aise who within three weeks had me speaking
                    beautiful French. I had all the fundamentals. The grace and the skill of
                    handling it, whipping out subjunctives and impressing people with that. I knew
                    the regional language supervisor was coming through Hong Kong. I got back just
                    in time. He passed me on the spot. With great amusement, I got two letters on
                    the same day: “I'm sorry to say thanks for your five years, but you are out of
                    here.” The other one said, “Congratulations on passing the French test. Carry
                    on.” I was promoted every 10 months thereafter. I went right through four
                    promotion boards, one after the other. I guess they tried to make up for that
                    lost time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in January 1962. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Vietnam. They said, “Here is a guy who knows abouVietnam. He was just
                    there. Ship him right back.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There weren't many in those days. 1962 was not high
                        Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>ROGERS: Not at all. I was assigned to be the number two person in the two man
                    Consular Section. When I arrived, I got off the plane and learned that the two
                    men from the Consular Section were on that plane leaving. Frank Malloy's
                    brother, Ian, was one. He drowned in Mexico some years later. I never met him.
                    Another fellow's name I cant remember. I never saw them. I was there all alone.
                    They actually departed on the same Pan Am aircraft on which my wife and I
                    arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in Saigon. In 1969, I was consul general in
                        Saigon. Whad a booming Consular Section. You were in Vietnam from 1962 to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Until March 1964.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Saigon like in 1962?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: The people were very, very sweet. We had an old building down the street
                    called Ham Nghi deep in the downtown. It was very insecure. When I arrived, I
                    was the Consular Section. Then, a fellow arrived, Harland Eastman, who became
                    the consul. I was his assistant for a while. Then another young man named
                    Anthony Lake came in. So, I always tell Tony Lake, the immediate past National
                    Security Advisor, that I was his first ever supervisor in the Foreign Service.
                    He agrees. It was great fun. William C. Trueheart was the deputy chief of
                    mission at that time. He was a wonderful person. I was very active and very
                    vigorous in this consular work. At that time, the Vietnamese government required
                    all military personnel to have a visa before they came there. They had to fill
                    out this elaborate form. So, I drafted a diplomatic note from William Trueheart
                    saying, “Our soldiers are coming here to help and protect you. I don't think
                    they should have to have a visa.” I presented that to him. He said, “You can't
                    do a diplomatic note like that. It's got to be elaborate, full of lavish
                    embellishments with a lot of depth and background.” I said, “Why don't you try
                    it? Let's see what happens.” He did and it worked. So, he was very pleased.
                    Then, a fellow named Dickson Boggs, who was the then staff aide to Ambassador
                    Frederick Nolting, was transferred to Belgium. Bill Trueheart asked me to take
                    over as staff aide to Fritz Nolting, which I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we moved to the ambassadorial aide job, what was
                        consulawork like during this 1962ish period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: One part was shipping and seamen. A lot of sailors had problems, getting
                    drunk, missing ship, that sort of thing. So, they took a little work. A lot of
                    visas were for Vietnamese military going to the U.S. for training. We required
                    them to have a visa. Occasionally, American citizens were very curious, wanted
                    to know what was going on. David Halberstam was there almost every day.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a “New York Times” correspondent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Yes. I got to know him very well. The famous “Beat” poet, Allen Ginsberg,
                    came to see me. I had read “Howl” earlier and he was so pleased that I knew
                    about it. He stayed with us in the office a long time, discussing Vietnam. I
                    can't remember what he was talking about now, but it was interesting to meet
                    him. He died fairly recently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Americans marrying Vietnamese women?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: There were a few. Q: Of course, we didn't have the military...</p>
                <p>ROGERS: We had a handful of military. Generally, it was discouraged. But if they
                    really meant it... Let us say that sometimes an amorous drunken week-end would
                    produce great affection and yet the Army would always say, “Give him two weeks
                    to cool off” and darn if they weren't right. Usually, most of those faded away.
                    But the sincere ones eventually got married. But some were just young,
                    inexperienced, and frankly, in some cases, being taken advantage of. Usually, if
                    made to wait a few weeks, it wore off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any adoption of Vietnamese orphans at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Yes, I helped with a lot of those.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: No, I don't think so.</p>
                <p>Q: In my time, the problem was bureaucratic. According to Vietnamese law, the
                    President had to approve each orphan's adoption if it was with a non-Vietnamese.
                    The President was kind of busy with a war on his hands.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>ROGERS: We never had that problem. There was a merchant seaman who posed a very
                    interesting problem. He was in love with a beautiful bar girl. She somehow
                    became pregnant. He loved her dearly. He was a simple person, brawny, strong,
                    and sweet. So, I said, “are you really going to keep this child?” “Yes, Sir, Mr.
                    Rogers. That is my child and I really want to have it.” I said, “You know,
                    you're not married.” “No.” “It would be a wise thing for that child's future if
                    you married before the child was born.” “Okay.” I said, “The baby is due within
                    hours.” “Yes.” “Let's go.” I got a U.S. missionary to go with me to the
                    hospital. He was marrying them as we got to the hospital steps. They were
                    pronounced husband and wife. Went in the doors and out came the baby, an
                    American citizen. Sadly, that man was killed in a motorcycle crash later, but I
                    gave the child a U.S. passport, to which he was then entitled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about jailed Americans? Was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Yes. One was a particularly difficult case. On the gangplank of a
                    merchant ship, he hit over the head a fellow merchant seaman from the same ship
                    and killed him, but as he killed him, he rolled back onto the dock. So, the
                    Vietnamese claimed jurisdiction over him. He got five years in Chiwa prison. We
                    had a lot of elaborate problems over that. He was still there when I left.
                    Eventually, he got out.</p>
                <p>There were a handful of merchant seamen... I hate to pick omerchant seaman.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: It was a pretty rough crowd, actually. They would get into all kinds of
                    drunken brawls and trouble. But that was their style. That's what they wanted to
                    do. We just let them sober up in jail for a couple of days and signed them onto
                    the next ship if the captain would take them.</p>

                <p>ROGERS: I think he was a very kind and wonderful person. I really adored him. He
                    was very good to everyone, very humane and thoughtful. He always found the best
                    side of a person, forgave their errors and stupidity. He was not always in focus
                    with all the elements of the country team, but he was the boss, so I think they
                    all liked him very, very much.</p>

                    ambassador. What was your impression of how the country team at that time viewed
                    Diem?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: Nolting's view was “We have to work with him. He is the leader of a
                    nation state which we recognize.” He was concerned that his brother, Ngo Diem
                    Nhu, was influencing him too much, but felt that if we worked with him,
                    gradually, things would be okay. He was concerned that Diem was out of touch
                    with the reality or just didn't want to face some aspects of it. He felt that he
                    had a distance, a sense of the traditional emperors, that he didn't feel for the
                    people. I remember when Diem would drive around in town, a police car would go
                    in front of him and everyone was required to turn facing the opposite way and
                    not look at him. They really meant it. I peeked. That didn't apply to me, so I
                    looked around to see him many times. Ambassador Nolting wanted to work with him,
                    knew his shortcomings, but he was concerned that if anything went awry, the
                    result would be more chaotic. Of course, he was quite right.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have any feeling for strong opinions contrary to this or just strong
                    opinions on the country team? Did these surface while you were present? I'm
                    thinking about the Political Section, the military, the CIA, etc. Did you pick
                    up any feel for this?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: No, on the contrary, my memory is that they pretty much supported him. A
                    problem developed more from newsmen who seemed to feel otherwise. I am sure
                    Halberstam was there during Nolting's tenure. They wanted to show drama and
                    excitement and become famous by reporting what they felt would sell newspapers.
                    John Mecklin was the USIS director in Saigon at that time. He wrote a book
                    called “Mission in Torment.” Nolting was on a cruise ship somewhere between
                    Greece and Yugoslavia when he heard on the radio that he had been replaced by
                    Henry Cabot Lodge in Vietnam. Nolting was sad, mystified, and hurt by that. He
                    went back to Vietnam very briefly. His childhood friend was DCM Bill Trueheart.
                    I think Nolting blamed Trueheart for Nolting's relief, but it wasn't Trueheart's
                    fault. It had nothing to do with him. The main purpose was for President Kennedy
                    to have a prominent Republican in Saigon to give the appearance of bipartisan
                    balance. Fritz Nolting did a wonderful job and I was very devoted to him. Some
                    weeks later, Henry Cabot Lodge arrived in Saigon with Freddy Flott and James
                    Michael Dunn, lieutenant colonel, U.S. Army. Freddy was the friend of George
                    Lodge, son of Henry Cabot Lodge. He needed a job, so George said, “Dad, could
                    you give Freddy a job?” Mike Dunn was a very tough, hard person who got to know
                    Lodge when Lodge was on two weeks' active duty for training in the Army Reserve.
                    He hooked onto him and became his hatchetman. Dunn enjoyed hurting people and
                    wrecking careers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the news of Nolting's replacement hit the
                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: We were all very sorry. We all loved him. We got in his place a distant,
                    rather arrogant, cold, famous person. Fritz Nolting would play the piano at his
                    residence. Lodge was a totally different style. He was very aloof. I remained
                    his staff aide until my normal time ran out, whereupon Tony Lake replaced me and
                    sometime later, Peter Tarnoff replaced him.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you get the impression or was it going around the embassy that Lodge had
                    come out to get tough with Diem and we really had to push? This was the Kennedy
                    administration. It was a pushy, hard-nosed... At least they liked to think they
                    were a hard-nosed administration. Did you get that feeling?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: Definitely. In fact, the first bump in this crescendo that developed was
                    when the first Buddhist self-immolation, burning suicide occurred. Madame Nhu,
                    Diem's sister-in-law, the so-called Dragon Lady, said, “It's just a barbecue.”
                    Lodge reacted with his first press statement. I was with him. He wrote, “It's
                    terrible to say such a thing” and criticized her directly. Buddhists were trying
                    to end the war either with communist influence, or on their own true peace
                    initiative. They were being harassed by the central government and Lodge on the
                    second or third day there (I was with him.) went to a famous Buddhist temple to
                    demonstrate his reaching out to other sectors of the community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Lodge use you as a staff aide?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: One traditional task was screening calls, listening to all of his phone
                    calls to take notes. As an illustration, suppose either he or Fritz Nolting
                    said, “Okay, I'll go to lunch Monday with you at 12:30.” I would write all that
                    down in his schedule book. That was one of my tasks to deal with all that. So, a
                    great deal of his oral flow went through me. I also organized his papers and got
                    there earlier than he so I would have all the cables arranged in a priority
                    system so he would be sure to read the most important ones first, that sort of
                    thing. I organized meetings for him. I was the “helpful hand.”</p>
                <p>Q: Did you get any feeling for the role of the CIA? Was there a difference
                    between the time of Nolting and the time of Lodge from your observation?</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>ROGERS: Yes. My clear memory is that the CIA station continued to try to work
                    with the Diem regime as Nolting had, but it finally came down to Lodge saying,
                    “Well, I'm the boss and we're going to do it my way.” I remember, symbolically,
                    he took the residence of the CIA station chief and said, “I think I want your
                    house.” It was a message to the Vietnamese saying, “I can do this and he works
                    for me.” He literally kicked him out of his house and lived there. That was only
                    maybe 10 houses away from me on the same street, Phung Khac Koan, so I remember
                    it very well. It was, perhaps, not historically important, but symbolically, at
                    the time, it was.</p>

                        Americamilitary as far as the Ambassador's action was concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Lodge knew General Paul Harkins in World War II. Harkins was then the
                    four star general who was the head of the military activities in Vietnam. They
                    had actually served together in the same regiment, as I recall. Paul Harkins was
                    his senior at one stage in an armored division.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Lodge resigned from the Senate, served in North

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: He know Harkins from that time. That was helpful. I think he got on
                    alright with him. Lucien Conein was a CIA officer. He is still living in
                    Virginia [Note: Conein died in 1999.]. I saw him at a funeral not too long ago.
                    He was a lieutenant colonel, uniformed. He was Lodge's liaison with restive
                    generals who were thinking of replacing Diem. My impression was he was involved
                    a great deal with that task, more so than much of the rest of the CIA. Conein
                    knew many of the senior Vietnamese officers when they were all in the French
                    army in WWII.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Oh, yes, and it gradually seemed to turn a corner and he'd say, “Well,
                    he's got to go.” How and when precisely that turn occurred, I don't recall. But
                    it did happen. Unfortunately, Diem and his brother, Ngo Diem Nhu, were killed
                    the following morning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there at the time?</hi>

                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>ROGERS: It was very, very tense. We knew of troop movements around town. We were
                    aware of that. I'll never forget, on the day of the coup, to show you how much I
                    was out of the loop (Even though I was the staff aide, there were some things I
                    never knew.), I went into work one day and Lodge didn't show up. Then, the coup
                    began. I called and he was having lunch with Mike Dunn. I said, “There is a coup
                    underway.” He said, “I know. I am staying here. You stay there.” So, Bill
                    Trueheart and I stayed in the office. We didn't know what was going to happen. I
                    had a submachine gun on my desk. I didn't know if they were going to storm the
                    building or what was going to happen. Mercifully, the embassy was not stormed.
                    It became very dramatic. I was at the embassy all night long. I went out in the
                    morning with Jim Rosenthal to walk over to the palace and we saw the damage that
                    had been done to it as it had been attacked. I walked around the grounds and in
                    the barracks of the palace guard. We didn't realize it at that time, but Diem
                    had fled to Cholon and was eventually picked up and killed by an army captain
                    who in turn was later killed. That was certainly an unforgettable and dramatic
                    day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you heard about these events, what were you getting
                        from thjunior officer mafia about this being a good thing or something
                        else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: I would say they were more conservative on it, feeling that the devil you
                    know is better than the devil you don't know, and that we'd better try to work
                    with this system that we know, try to get his brother, Ngo Diem Nhu, out of
                    power. In fact, Lodge once suggested to Diem, “Maybe it would be better if your
                    brother took some leave in the Philippines or someplace” and tried to gracefully
                    get rid of him. Diem wouldn't hear of it. From what I know about junior
                    officers, in my view they're all very sincere, conscientious people who did the
                    best they could.</p>
                <p>Q: At that time, did we have much in the way of language officers and people who
                    were out in the field or was it pretty much an embassy-centered operation?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: The latter, although in approximately 1963, we began getting Vietnamese
                    language trained people there. The only one I recall who spoke Vietnamese and
                    was there immediately before I arrived was Lyle Brecken. He is still living and
                    is a good friend. Then, six other Vietnamese-trained people arrived. But there
                    weren't too many. Most of our work was done in French. I didn't speak
                    Vietnamese.</p>

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>ROGERS: No. We did have provincial reporters, but not as elaborate as the CORDS
                    program eventually became. It was very small, nothing like was later there. One
                    of those provincial reporters later became Assistant Secretary of State for East
                    Asia and the Pacific and for EUR, Richard Holbrooke [Note: U.S. representative
                    to the UN in 1999]. He was one of those first provincial reporters. I remember
                    distinctly when he came to the office and said, “I have to see the ambassador.”
                    I said, “Okay.” I was not the doorkeeper. I wanted to facilitate communication.
                    I said, “He's got some ambassador in there now making a courtesy call and he has
                    somebody else coming later, but I'll hold that so you can get in and tell him
                    your story.” His point was that things were not as rosy as had been reported by
                    the military in the Mekong Delta region. That was the first time I met
                    Holbrooke. He was certainly very hard-driving, very determined to get his
                    message across, which was a message in contrast to what others were reporting.
                    He was out there in the field.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any concern that maybe our information was coming too much from sort
                    of political circles within Saigon and not really reflecting the state of the
                    country?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: Yes. I used to call it “veranda reporting.” You sit around with the usual
                    suspects, the same old folks, in sort of an incestuous turnabout and you hear
                    the same story.</p>

                    Either it's the veranda or it's what the taxi driver told you on the way to the
                    airport and that's the way the lazy people do their reporting. But hopefully,
                    I'm confident, nowadays people are much more astute and professional about
                    it.</p>

                <p>ROGERS: No, I don't think so. There was some theoretical domino collapse
                    nonsense, but I certainly didn't buy that. I didn't think it made any sense.
                    That was that if Vietnam falls - to what? Into itself. Actually, the concept
                    was, we were trying to help the people of Vietnam establish their own
                    independent identity free from outside control (read China, Soviet Union). I
                    think that if the Cold War were not underway, we would have taken no particular
                    interest. Just as in much of Africa, our interest was sparked by East-West
                    struggle, but it had nothing or almost nothing to do with our direct
                    interest.</p>

                    just kind of touchy, hoping that it would all work out. Lodge had me organize a
                    dinner for what he called either the Council of Sages or the Council of
                    Notables, some across-the-board group we tried to piece together to try to get
                    people from all aspects of life - university, religious groups, business, and so
                    forth - and try to get them collectively to see how best we should proceed to
                    assist them in their development. I recall also that that didn't amount to much.

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: They were very much - I won't say francophone, but had a veneer of French
                    style to them. They were certainly not pro-French in that all of them wanted
                    independence from France. They were glad of that. I think that they had enough
                    of the French. Some businessmen still stayed there and seemed quite content.
                    There was a sense that “This is our nation and we want to do it our way.” I'm
                    sad to say that our position was, “Go ahead, provided China and the Soviet Union
                    aren't involved,” which they were. I suppose China historically did look upon
                    Indochina as a former satrapy that owed fidelity to China. They had many
                    conflicts. They had been occupied and had wars with China over the years. On the
                    other hand, during the French colonial period, especially during World War II
                    when the Vichy government controlled it, a lot of Vietnamese were inside China.
                    A lot of the Vietnamese “democratic patriots,” as they called themselves, worked
                    within China in the hopes of eventually getting the French out. Of course, they
                    didn't.</p>
                <p>Politically, it's a Mandarin elitist culture from the old animite times. It's my
                    theory that Diem saw himself as a replacement for Bao Dai and that he was a
                    regal personality. His family was very powerful. Ngo Diem Tuc was the Archbishop
                    of Hue, the senior Catholic official in Vietnam.</p>

                <p>ROGERS: I remember, when Kennedy was assassinated, I had to look in a book to see
                    how you make the black mourning wreath on the flag to put out in front of the
                    embassy. All those little things. But shortly after that, my tour of duty ended
                    in January. Tony Lake replaced me and I went off to my next assignment.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Assistant political advisor, Atlantic Command SACLANT, anU.S. Atlantic
                    Fleet, in Norfolk, Virginia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: My hope was that the nation would find peace and end the horrible
                    suffering and there would be an end to our future involvement. A little while
                    later (I had only been in Norfolk for a very short time.), a car bomb blew up on
                    the street next to the embassy, killing my dear friend who was the consular
                    assistant, Tran Phu Tho, and decapitated him. I was terribly upset by that. It
                    killed several others in the building, including a few Americans.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: No, I think we knew almost nothing. I think our intelligence was very
                    poor. Cross-border operations or efforts to penetrate were failures. Freddy
                    Flott, of all things, was in charge of cross-border operations, meeting landing
                    people in various parts of the country to conduct activities. But I don't think
                    any of them were ever successful.</p>

                <p>ROGERS: It was to help the Atlantic Command and all of its elements to know about
                    political and economic events that were important for their activities
                    throughout all of Latin America and the Caribbean, plus on the SACLANT side, all
                    of Western Europe down to but not including North Africa. That was the NATO
                    component. SACLANT's NATO half was vested in the U.S. admiral who was the
                    CINCLANT commander, so he had both jobs at the same time. A major portion of the
                    work had to do with NATO and political briefings on what was going on in Europe
                    and allied organizations and, to a small extent, what was happening in Latin
                    America. We would get copies of all kinds of material and decide what was
                    important enough to brief and consult with senior officers of the U.S. in
                    Norfolk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were probably several admirals while you were
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Only two, Harold Page Smith and Thomas Moore, who later became CNO and
                    Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Both were very able and good people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. During this time, what was the posture of the
                        Soviefleet as you saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Aggressive, very pressing to the outer limits. They would have electronic
                    intelligence ships just outside of Norfolk and were just pushing the envelope
                    very much and trailing our ships and coming too close, just, generally, had a
                    “What are you going to do about it” attitude in the Atlantic fleet and, to some
                    extent, also in the Mediterranean. When there were fleet exercises, they would
                    move around out there and say, “We're watching you. We know you're there.” The
                    Soviet navy was aggressive.</p>
                <p>Two sets of problems occurred during the same time. DeGaulle removed the French
                    forces from Allied military direct command. Eventually, that caused the transfer
                    of NATO in Paris to Brussels.</p>
                <p>Additionally, there was a major problem in the Dominican Republic. I think the
                    major issue was concern about an East-West struggle in Continental Europe and
                    how it would play out at sea, the importance of keeping the sea lanes open and
                    fleet readiness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much concern about Cuba at that point?</hi>

                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>ROGERS: No. But I remember, some of the admirals were very annoyed that when the
                    Bay of Pigs landing had occurred, that we didn't follow up on it. They were
                    pretty prepared to... I think some of them hoped it would happen again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about The Dominican Republican dimension, how did that
                        plaout from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: We had an operations room that I was part of where all the positions were
                    manned round-the-clock by various folks from the armed forces, probably heavily
                    overstaffed. I think it was an awful lot of effort. They also saw it as an
                    exercise training in how to do these kinds of operations. At that time, most of
                    the Latin American countries were headed by military officers, which the senior
                    officers at the Atlantic command thought was a good thing. Why not? What's wrong
                    with having an admiral as President? Portugal does.</p>

                        internationallpolitically savvy were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Harold Page Smith was. Of course, on the SACLANT staff, we had a large
                    number of military and naval officers from Allied countries literally on the
                    staff in Norfolk: France, Belgium, Germany... I remember a German officer who
                    had a submarine badge from World War II that he proudly wore. Italy, Norway,
                    Portugal... Almost all of the 14 NATO nations, less Iceland, had someone on the
                    staff. The vice commander was a British three star in Norfolk, so it was a
                    thoroughly integrated international NATO staff.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any feeling during this 1964-1966 period about levies on American
                    forces to help in Vietnam? Was this beginning to become a problem?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: I don't recall that, but I know that many colleagues in Norfolk went to
                    Southeast Asia duty. Whether or not there was an actual reduction in the
                    Atlantic forces committed, I don't recall that. I don't recall if we had to
                    transfer significant ships to that area. At that time, there was also
                    COMIDEASTFOR, which was a seaplane tender.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: It was still a Portuguese colony. Some guerrilla warfare was still going
                    on in the northwest in an area called the Dembos. In various areas of the
                    country were three competing groups: FNLA (National Front for the Liberation of
                    Angola), UNITA, and then the major one was the MPLA. They were competing to a
                    certain extent among each other, but mostly against the Portuguese central
                    government.</p>

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>ROGERS: Yes. I think the EUR Bureau was supportive of Portugal because of our
                    interests in the Atlantic Alliance. The Africa Bureau was more inclined toward
                    decolonization. I don't think we had a very fixed policy at that time. It was
                    more or less to monitor the situation and see how the internal struggle was
                    going. The South African government clearly supported the Portuguese. The Congo,
                    Zaire, supported the FNLA, Holden Roberto, who actually lived in Kinshasa.
                    Gradually, the war struggled on.</p>

                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>ROGERS: I was in Luanda. That's a beautiful seaport, a very ancient town. When
                    the Portuguese explorers first landed about 120 miles north of there at the
                    mouth of the Congo (Zaire) River, they found a very organized kingdom called the
                    Kingdom of the Congo. Its capital in northwestern Angola was renamed by the
                    Portuguese Sao Salvador (Savior). The Portuguese regrettably, although they were
                    most welcomed by the indigenous people, didn't take too long in corrupting them.
                    The Catholic priests who were then headquartered at Sao Tome, a Portuguese
                    island out in the Bight of Benin, gradually became slavers themselves and got
                    into the slave trade, had numerous fights with the indigenous tribes who
                    believed, sadly, that if they became Catholic, they would be saved from these
                    rapacious priests. They were sadly disappointed because their kingdom was
                    destroyed. As with many parts of Africa, part of that kingdom was inside what is
                    now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or old Zaire. The straight lines that
                    the Europeans drew had nothing much to do with where the tribes were. When I was
                    there, the Portuguese were still very, very severe with the population, forcing
                    them to do road maintenance. Essentially, the local chief would be assigned work
                    products and he had to get those accomplished. The Portugese were still fairly
                    brutal in those days. There were harsh physical punishments for not completing a
                    task. They had another concept for persons called “assimilados” (to assimilate).
                    Africans who would adapt a veneer of European (meaning Portuguese) civilization
                    were treated a good deal better. There was a great deal of intermarriage. The
                    Portugese, wherever they went, often married into the local population. The
                    country was certainly very, very rich. It had diamonds and wonderful coffee, the
                    largest coffee plantation in the world. “CADA” is south of Luanda. There was
                    copper and marvelous forest products. Of course, Portugal exploited that. Luanda
                    was one of the stops around Africa where the caravels or small ships had station
                    stops on their way to the spice islands, the East Indies and India. These were
                    more important to them as waystations to their greater goal rather than just in
                    their own right. When I was there, the revolution, the guerrilla warfare, was
                    not resolved. Portugal put a lot of effort into it. At the same time, Portugal
                    had revolutions going on in Guinea Bissau and, to a lesser extent, in
                    Mozambique, so they had their hands full. When I left in 1968, it was not by any
                    means over. Portugal controlled all the main cities and towns, and the Benguela
                    railroad from Lobito port, all the way to Zambia. That was absolutely
                    fascinating. I rode on it. It had coal burning trains. The train would often
                    catch on fire from its own fireboxes and they would stop and put it out and keep
                    going. It was a very, very beautiful country. There were great deserts in the
                    southwest, deep jungles in the northwest, and in the center a beautiful 5,000
                    foot high plateau of great beauty and perfect weather.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: The main task was to report on the revolutionary activities and to assist
                    U.S. Navy ship visits. In those days, COMIDEASTFOR had what are called short
                    hull destroyers. They couldn't make it all the way around to the Middle East on
                    their own. They had to make at least one stop. At that time, the Suez Canal was
                    closed, so they had to go the hard way around the Cape. They often stopped in
                    Luanda. In fact, one of the most fascinating visits was the USS Liberty, AGTR.
                    Commander McConaughy was the captain. They had been there at least twice. Their
                    last visit was cut short. Of course, the rest is history. They went up to
                    offshore Israel, where they were severely damaged and took heavy casualties from
                    the Israeli Air Force. McConaughy [Note: McConaughy died in 1999] received the
                    Medal of Honor and invited me to the ceremony. Other than that, U.S. commercial
                    interests were important. Oil had just been discovered in Cabinda while I was
                    there. That was U.S. Gulf Oil. Later, Texaco and one or two other American
                    companies came in. The oil exploration in the northwest of Angola was of great
                    value. We had a number of American citizens throughout Angola. There were about
                    150 missionaries who had been there for generations, Seventh Day Adventists to
                    evangelical groups. We tried to look after their safety.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you under any constraints? You obviously could talk to Portuguese
                    authorities, but what about the rebels? Did you have any contacts with them?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: Not knowingly. I knew a lot of people who later turned out to be MPLA
                    sympathizers. These were mulattos, people who at least for one or two
                    generations had been Portuguese assimilados. The MPLA was essentially a mulatto
                    structure, while the FNLA and the UNITA were totally African tribal based. The
                    famous Jonas Savimbi, whom I've met in this country, was raised in a U.S.
                    Protestant mission in central Angola, which I had visited. He learned English
                    there. I don't think he was a physician, but was sort of a nurse's aide in that
                    compound. The center of Angola was very sympathetic toward UNITA. There were no
                    particular restrictions. I could talk to anybody who was willing to talk with
                    me. I traveled extensively.</p>
                <p>Q: Unlike some of the other places, you mentioned the assimilation that was
                    happening. At your office or at receptions, were Africans as well as Portuguese
                    attending?</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>ROGERS: Yes. There were a lot of, in the academic world, Portuguese-trained
                    Africans, a lot of teachers, some in what was called the merchant class. Given
                    another century or two, they might well have developed, as the Portuguese had
                    hoped, into “good” Portuguese citizens. Ultimately, most of them decided that
                    their future was with their African roots and when the opportunity came, cast
                    off the Portuguese. What happened was, a coup in Portugal ended colonialism.
                    That happened after my first service in Angola.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Portuguese government
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: They espoused a very strong, almost zealot-like, missionary creed that
                    they were right, they were civilizing this African nation, and that, eventually,
                    it would be understood that this was merely a part of Portugal that happened to
                    be in Africa. One of their examples was, well, after all, Alaska is not
                    contiguous to the U.S., but it is nonetheless part of the U.S. They would say,
                    “See, we have parts of Portugal that just happen to be overseas.” They had great
                    pride in the glorious age of discovery and Diego Cao, who was the first explorer
                    there. Henry the Navigator sent these fellows out. Portugal had been in Angola
                    for more than 400 years. It had been partly occupied by the Dutch at one time.
                    They had to deal with that, eventually. They were very proud of their heritage.
                    As far as I could tell, they all felt that if the world would just be patient
                    enough, everyone would understand that they were civilizing responsibility to an
                    indigenous people.</p>
                <p>Q: How did we act there? This was still part of the changes in Africa. Basically,
                    we had welcomed the expulsion of the Europeans and new African countries
                    developing. How did we all play it in Angola at that time?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: I think the policy of the Africa Bureau was in due course: independence.
                    At the same time, the European Bureau said, “Wait, don't forget that we need the
                    Azores and their friendship in the Atlantic Alliance and SACLANT.” So, there was
                    a dichotomy in policy, no question about it. The Africa Bureau did not have the
                    influence, strength, or perhaps even access to overcome the stronger hand of the
                    European Bureau. Angola was an absolutely beautiful country, very unforgettable.
                    We had a lot of sickness. My wife got malaria there and our child did. too. I
                    had met many American missionaries. He was in town and I went to get him. I
                    hoped he would help me with this malaria. His theme was, “Oh, well, of course,
                    there is no medicine. You just pray by them, and it will work out.” I wasn't too
                    pleased with that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any developments or incidents while you were

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Not this time, but later when we get to 1975 when I go bacto Angola,
                    we'll have some.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Jamaica.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Jamaica from 1968 to when? ROGERS: July
                        1972.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: The first was Walter Tobriner, who was one of the three District of
                    Columbia commissioners when there was no mayor in the District. At that time,
                    there were two civilian appointees plus a U.S. Army engineer. Walter Tobriner
                    was a Democrat and was appointed by Lyndon Johnson to be the ambassador. He was
                    there when I arrived.</p>
                <p>He was replaced by a Republican, Vincent De Roulet, whose mother in law was a
                    contributor to Richard Nixon. When the parties changed, he got that assignment.
                    She was the owner of the New York Mets baseball team at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a controversial figure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me about him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>ROGERS: He died at 48. He was tall, a little bit frail. I think his father owned
                    Foremost Dairies in California. He married Lorinda Dayson of the Witney family.
                    He was eccentric and fancied himself a certain stature in U.S. society which, if
                    it exists, I've never seen it. When I was first assigned there, he asked me to
                    come and meet him on his estate on Long Island. We got to the house and the
                    front gate was enormous. It was really his wife's estate. He had a 90 foot
                    yacht, “Patrina,” and looked upon the Jamaicans perhaps as the Portuguese looked
                    upon those from Angola that they considered must be looked after, so that they
                    could eventually develop. Civilizing nonsense. When my tour was up after two
                    years, he kept getting extensions of six months for me because I had become a
                    very dear friend of the person whom I had claimed would become the prime
                    minister of Jamaica. De Roulet said, “Oh, that's impossible. He couldn't
                    possibly win the election.” So, I said, “Okay, there are 52 parliamentary seats.
                    Whoever takes half plus one, the leader of that party will be the prime
                    minister.” I gave him a list of 52 and I said, “These are the seats that will be
                    won by the People's National Party (Michael Manley's).” I'll never forget, the
                    night of that election (That was in 1972.), Vincent De Roulet had a party of the
                    country team and friends. The symbol of the Jamaica Labor Party was a bell. He
                    had on every table a bell that was to be rung when Hugh Shearer would have been
                    reelected. Shearer was a lovely person, a very nice guy. I saw him not too long
                    ago. The news came through that the People's National Party had won. The phone
                    rang and whoever took the call said to the ambassador, “Well, it's Michael
                    Manley.” He said, “Oh, Ill take the call right away.” He said, “No, Mr. Manley
                    wants to speak to Mr. Rogers, not you.” This was the end of my career in
                    Jamaica.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, God. So Manley knew what he was doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Oh, yes. Worse, Manley said that he wanted me to come right over to his
                    home. I asked permission. He said, “Yes, go ahead.” When I got there, the chief
                    of the Jamaican army arrived in his uniform at Manley's house drunk. Manley
                    kicked him out and fired him from the army the next day. All these people are
                    dead now, sadly. But that was a fascinating time. I was still there for several
                    weeks. Michael used to call me and De Roulet would say, “You can't go to his
                    house anymore.” So, Michael Manley would come over to my house and sit on the
                    front porch at six or seven o'clock in the morning. He said, “What is this? What
                    are these things?” I said, “Well, they're all things about voting at the United
                    Nations, oceans, and so forth.” He said, “We're going to decide in the cabinet
                    what to do about a vote.” So, I would brief him on all these things. He had no
                    background in it. He had no idea what it was all about. So, it was great fun for
                    a few weeks. I had been there double the length of time I was supposed to have
                    been. But it was very exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't De Roulet do things like forbid visa applicants
                        from usinthe toilets and things of that nature - or was that someone
                        else?</hi>

                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>ROGERS: There are a lot of stories about Vincent De Roulet, some of which have
                    been embellished and unfairly so, but by and large, 2/3 of them are true. They
                    are mostly rather petty, silly things that are hardly worth mentioning. He made
                    a mistake when he, after that election, went back to the U.S. and said in a an
                    open session of Congress that Michael Manley had promised him that he would not
                    nationalize the bauxite industry. That was of great interest to us because four
                    out of the five bauxite aluminum companies in Jamaica were American (one is
                    Canadian). I had only left a few weeks before. The government in Jamaica
                    informed the Department of State that Vincent De Roulet was “no longer persona
                    grata.” He was not permitted to return. They always make that distinction. He
                    wasn't PNGed; he was “no longer persona grata.” What they did was very polite.
                    They said, “However, later, if he would like to come down on a holiday, he is
                    always welcome.” It seemed to me that he listened to the station chief, who was
                    certainly a conservative Republican as well, and he read things as he wanted
                    them to be, rather than the reality that they were. Incidentally, of the 52
                    seats that I predicted in advance and reported to the Department of State, 51
                    were correct. The 52nd on a recount was also correct two weeks later. That was
                    the brother of Michael Manley, Douglas Manley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Chief of the Political Section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before Manley came in, what was the political situation
                        iJamaica?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Since independence, it's always been parliamentary democracy, the
                    Westminister system. When I arrived, the Jamaica Labor Party was in power. Hugh
                    Shearer was the Prime Minister. Earlier, Michael Manley's father, Norman, had
                    been the premier once of what was to have been a West Indies Federation of
                    Trinidad, Tobago, all of the British Antilles, Windward Islands, Jamaica, etc.
                    But it was so scattered and diverse that it just couldn't hold together. It
                    didn't sustain itself and didn't work. So, the parts broke up into separate
                    units of the Commonwealth. I remember when Michael Manley made his first speech
                    in Parliament, when he was first elected to a seat, the Jamaica Labor Party
                    still being in government, his father saw me and he said, “How did Michael do?”
                    I said, “He did fine, but why didn't you go?” He said, “I didn't want to make
                    him nervous.” Norman Manley died in 1970. Michael Manley died early in 1997.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Manley at that time? He was
                        rathecontroversial.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>ROGERS: Oh, yes. I liked him very much. He was then a labor leader, the National
                    Worker's Union. He was called “the island supervisor” of the union. That union
                    was mostly in sugar, but later in the bauxite alumina industry. Both political
                    parties, the PNP and the JLP, had as their power base labor unions. One, the
                    ILB, developed out of a labor union, BITU, and the other party, PNP, formed a
                    labor union from itself. So, they were very work-oriented. I saw Michael many
                    times after I left. He used to come and visit. He kept writing to me. He kept
                    worrying about what he called his “Third World credentials.” I used to argue
                    with him that the Third World is a myth. It isn't there. It's all self-interest
                    and puffery. But he said, “That's not true. I've been to Algeria and Cuba and
                    these people understand that.” I said, “They're taking advantage of you.”</p>
                <p>Q: You had this time with him, but did you find that basically most of the rest
                    of the embassy considered him beyond the pale? Was there a problem?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: The assumption was that he would never amount to anything. They couldn't
                    believe it when he got elected the first time to a parliamentary seat. They
                    couldn't believe it when his party won the general elections. “Why, this can't
                    happen. This is a conservative government.” Otherwise, the theory was that
                    because Manley was a “socialist,” our mining interests would be nationalized.
                    They were. To put it in the terms of the time, they were “Jamaicanized.”
                    Curiously, when I returned from Jamaica, I was first assigned to be the desk
                    officer for Uruguay and Paraguay and then Argentina. After some months, I was
                    loaned back to be the Jamaica desk officer during the negotiation on the
                    Jamaicanization of the bauxite aluminum industry. I made a number of trips back
                    and forth to Jamaica in that regard and to the corporate headquarters of the
                    various companies such as ALCOA. That thread of contact carried on even after I
                    left.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: That was the concern, yes. That is because bauxite in its first stage of
                    refined powder, alumina, has no value at all until it is extruded into alumina,
                    then to aluminum, which is done in Canada and the U.S. Bauxite has no real value
                    in its form in Jamaica. Manley and his economic aides wanted to assign to it a
                    “national” value. That is, to find out what the market price of tubing and
                    sheeting would be in Toronto and Pittsburgh and then back down from that and say
                    a certain percent of that value was what we should have. That was how they tried
                    to change the value. Of course, the Jamaicanization and the nationalization
                    after that meant that almost every major aspect of the economy was nationalized:
                    tourism, hotels... The government of Jamaicadid not have the manpower, the
                    skill, and the talent to operate any of this stuff. Eventually, it was permitted
                    to revert to the private economy.</p>

                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>ROGERS: It was. Just as in some parts of Washington, DC, I wouldn't want to walk
                    at night, or even in the day, now, certainly in the tough areas of Kingston, it
                    was not wise for anyone to be there unless they lived there. People were
                    desperately poor. Even though I was well-known in the ghetto, it still was
                    terribly unsafe, even for me.</p>
                <p>The Rastafarian cult was very interesting. The followers felt that Haile Selassie
                    of Ethiopia, who was then still living, was in fact the personification of God
                    on Earth. They literally worshiped him. Some people who really didn't have that
                    “calling” adopted that lifestyle, which was associated with some musicians. To
                    understand the true nature of Haile Selassie, you had to take the “herb.” The
                    herb is ganja, or marijuana. I think so many of them who had adopted that faith
                    system were not particularly sincere in their ecclesiastical orientation, but
                    wanted a little pot.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Yes, but much less so than now. Jamaicans had been using marijuana for
                    countless years as a medicinal supplement called “bush tea.” It was said to be
                    good for a toothache. The toothache didn't go away, but you didn't feel it
                    anymore. It was an old traditional herbal medicine.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: No, not then, but Russian ships used to visit after they visited Cuba. I
                    actually used to go down and go on the Russian ships and visit. They were all
                    electronic surveillance ships, no warships. They had giant masts and huge globes
                    on the top with listening equipment on board. The personnel were very pleasant.
                    I would come abroad, call on the captain, and give him a bottle of Jamaican rum.
                    He would give me some phonograph records. There was no problem at all. It was
                    after I left that the identity with Castro became so close. In fact, Castro went
                    to Michael Manley's funeral last spring.</p>

                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>ROGERS: By and large, they felt that he was artificially presumptuous, as if he
                    were from a royal class that didn't exist in our country. In many respects, I
                    really liked him in spite of himself. But he was terribly insecure, didn't know
                    what he was doing. But he had been a spoiled, privileged person all his life. He
                    would make fun of it, too. He would say, “I'll never forget when I first went
                    into the Air Force and my chauffeur drove me up to the camp. The boys thought
                    this was great. But strangely, the drill sergeant didn't think that was
                    appropriate.” He made fun of himself in those regards. I liked him. His wife was
                    very nice. But he didn't understand that setting.</p>
                <p>At that time, I'll never forget, Herbert Kalmbach came through. I didn't know how
                    things worked in this way. Well, that was for De Roulet to make a contribution
                    and then make a “wish list.” How they did that was so funny. Kalmbach would say,
                    “Write a letter to your mother or your mother in law and tell her what you would
                    like to do next.” He would take that. This was the wish list of the
                    contributors. But you don't write to the President. You write it to your mother
                    and he took it away. I thought it was very cute. De Roulet asked for either
                    Paris or Madrid. It turned out that coterie went down the tubes. I remember now,
                    he took me to see Maurice Stans, the Secretary of Commerce, in Washington. He
                    knew those people very well, the Republican inner circle.</p>

                    my very close friends and see them often. It probably is, mile for mile, the

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Probably slightly less than a year. The two important things that
                    occurred during that time... An American public safety advisor had been captured
                    by the Tupamaro guerrillas. I never knew him. That was one of our terrible
                    problems. He was murdered by the Tupamaros. On my briefing trip, I went to make
                    a call on President Stroessner. As I was coming out, Juan Peron walked in. Juan
                    Peron was a citizen of Paraguay because when he escaped across the river some
                    years earlier, when they were after him, Stroessner made him a citizen of
                    Paraguay and gave him a passport.</p>
                <p>Siracusa was ambassador to Uruguay. He was a charming fellow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view the Tupamaro movement at this time?
                        We'rtalking about 1972 to 1973.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: As a terrorist organization. I think they made a tremendous blunder by
                    capturing and ultimately killing this American official. That is not the way to
                    win friends and influence people. Even though the government of Uruguay was then
                    very repressive and rightist, as certainly was Paraguay, they didn't have that
                    kind of problem. Paraguay's big issue then was building an enormous Iguazu dam
                    on the Brazilian border. I went there a couple of times. It was extremely
                    interesting. I had a wonderful boss named William Stedman, who was director of
                    that unit. He went off to be ambassador to Bolivia and Frank Ortiz replaced him
                    just at the time when the Jamaicanization or nationalization of the bauxite
                    alumina industry occurred. So, I was assigned to be the Jamaica and Guyana desk
                    officer. I worked those talks. I made trips to Jamaica to review all aspects of
                    U.S. investments there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there on the Jamaica and Guyana desk from 1973 to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: 1973 to 1974. Then, I was assigned to the only bad assignment I ever had
                    at the request of a friend from Vietnam who had become a very senior officer in
                    ACDA (Arms Control and Disarmament Agency). He had me assigned to ACDA. It was
                    interesting. I learned a lot about nuclear weapons proliferation, and chemical
                    and biological warfare. But, suddenly, this mentor, who shall remain nameless,
                    was transferred elsewhere. I was isolated high and dry. The Arms Control people
                    who worked there had no interest in arms control at all, but quite the reverse.
                    I was sent on a trip around parts of South America having to do with nuclear
                    weapons proliferation. We were concerned that Brazil and Argentina were making
                    nuclear weapons.</p>

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>ROGERS: We were really worried about that. Because I had had Latin American
                    experience, I was assigned by ACDA to go with a physicist and another person to
                    try to ferret this out. The trip also took us to Chile, Peru, and Mexico.
                    Argentina and Brazil were the main targets of the trip. The concern was that
                    they were going to buy a reactor called the Becker Nozzle System. This would
                    permit weapons grade untraceable byproduct to come out of the reactor so that
                    they could, without IAEA monitoring, make nuclear bombs. There is a Westinghouse
                    similar product of similar price. We were trying to encourage them to buy not
                    the German Becker, but the Westinghouse model which we could monitor well for a
                    lot of reasons, partly because our engineers were supervising it. That was the
                    main project. I was assigned to write the report on this trip and I did so. As
                    an experienced FSO, I cleared each part of the report with the desk officer of
                    each of the countries we visited. The then director of ACDA, Fred Ikl�, sent
                    word down that I had shown my trip report to the State Department and this was a
                    terrible thing to do. I said, “What are you talking about? It's the same
                    government. They have to do the work after we leave.” They were furious. I was
                    so shocked at attitude. I was in shaky condition, then. Suddenly, a call came
                    that “We need somebody in Angola right away, because there has been a coup in
                    Portugal. They're going to have independence in about three months. Could you
                    go? We have all kinds of terrible problems on reporting, refugees, American
                    citizen protection, that sort of thing.” I said, “Sure, whatever is needed.” I
                    was delighted to escape ACDA. It still was an exciting and dramatic challenge.
                    Within 36 hours, I was on my way to Angola.</p>

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>ROGERS: There were three parts to it. They needed somebody who knew the country
                    to go out and find out what was going on in the bush and who spoke Portuguese.
                    At the same time, there was an enormous refugee problem, airlift and sealift.
                    They reached back in history and found out that I had a lot of sealift
                    experience in the Navy, moving people about. I don't know if they could find
                    anybody else or not, but they sent me. It worked out. It was very exciting and
                    extremely dangerous. When independence was about to occur... We were phasing
                    down. We had tremendous difficulty with our missionaries who were in danger. We
                    had to help some of them escape. They had radios. The MPLA, which was winning,
                    felt quite correctly that the missionaries were sympathetic toward UNITA. I went
                    in and helped a number of them get out. Some of them went south across the
                    border into what is now Namibia. Some went out by air and various other ways. It
                    was an exciting time. I went all over Angola at that time in a small one engine
                    airplane. There were refugee movements...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the refugees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: The Portuguese who wanted to get out of there and go back to Portugal.
                    There were hundreds of thousands, poor farmers, shopkeepers deep in the
                    interior, colonists who had planned to stay there for their lives and were
                    suddenly terribly frightened. The Portuguese government, with help from Germany,
                    Britain, and Belgium, helped move them out. It worked out pretty well.
                    Curiously, it was on the news (my wife heard it) that our post had closed and
                    that we had withdrawn except that they had left one officer behind. She said, “I
                    know who that is.” It was indeed going to be me. I was supposed to stay behind
                    with one radio man to describe the transition from independence. But I later
                    learned that Kissinger personally said, “Don't leave anybody.” I was ordered out
                    on the very last airplane, which was a charter flight from World Airlines. We
                    packed it with everybody. Some MPLA armed youths tried to stop some of our
                    non-American passengers. I said that they could not be released because they
                    were my prisoners. I got away with that! We knew it would be the last plane.
                    When we got on the plane, the tower operator, whom I knew, came down and said,
                    “Can I go, too?” I said, “Sure.” His name was Coehla, which means “rabbit.” We
                    flew to Abidjan for refueling, then to Lisbon, and a couple of days later went
                    to New York. Curiously, that very same airplane crashed and burned six weeks
                    later on a runway in New York. No one was killed, but it was destroyed. I have a
                    photo of that.</p>

                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>ROGERS: My memory of it is that because the MPLA appeared to be a communist
                    government and would provide base rights to the USSR, we were hoping that UNITA
                    would prevail. The U.S. and South Africa were supporting UNITA at that stage. We
                    didn't want to recognize the MPLA government in Luanda until UNITA had taken
                    over. I think that's historically an important building block. In fact, the
                    South African Army got as far north as about 50 miles south of Luanda. When I
                    was there, I drove to the port of Novo Redondo and saw the first Cuban troops
                    come in by ship. The Cubans had several major fights with the South Africans.
                    Eventually, the U.S. disengaged and the South Africans withdrew. Later, the
                    South Africans again engaged the MPLA and their Cuban allies. Some years later,
                    The USA recognized the MPLA.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you feel about this and what were you reporting back? Did you see an
                    opportunity for us to stay on or was this really called from Washington as far
                    as them trying to send a message or they were too pessimistic?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: My estimate is that Washington saw that the MPLA, with Cuban support was
                    going to win - and they didn't want to have American staff there with the issue
                    of formal recognition. Several Americans and British mercenaries were captured.
                    One American was executed after I left. He was from Wheaton, Maryland. The whole
                    thing was in utter chaos at that time, really a mess. Our leadership decided
                    everybody would leave, probably rightly so.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: The Red Cross from Switzerland was helping. They were a marvelous help.
                    But other than the Swiss, I don't remember anyone else. The Portuguese Red Cross
                    helped, too. There were large camps outside of Luanda where these people would
                    assemble deep in the interior. They would go to the army camps and then they
                    would try to compose lists, put the families back together again before they
                    left, but if not, ship them out and sort it out in Portugal. It was ordered

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: That was a Portuguese Army unit in the southern Port of Mo��medes, who
                    turned over their weapons. A motley crew, I remember them well. In some of the
                    barracks east of Luanda, the Portuguese were pro-MPLA. Why? Because they were
                    “assimilated” and they wanted the MPLA to prevail. Indeed, at that time, the
                    coup in Portugal was certainly radical socialist.</p>

                <p>ROGERS: Yes. So, my memory of it is, the Portuguese left arms not to just
                    anybody, but to the MPLA, which was seen as communist. Angola became the victim
                    of the East-West struggle that went on for another 15 years. I was given the
                    Award for Valor for this exercise, which is a rare decoration.</p>

                <p>ROGERS: I rented a car from a friend of mine who owned an automobile rental
                    agency. There was firing on the street. I don't know if they were trying to hit
                    me for sure, but my car was fired at. I could have been seen as a white South
                    African. The South Africans had deeply penetrated. I suppose I look South
                    African. But it was, in the end, a terrible tragedy. There was enormous
                    suffering. Of course, that was just the beginning of the terrible suffering in
                    Angola. It was utterly unnecessary. It could have been handled so much

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: The principal officer at that time was Tom Killoran, a wonderful, very
                    brave guy. He lives in Cape Cod. I hope he is still living. He got malaria while
                    I was there and he was very weak. One of our last tasks was to destroy all the
                    communications equipment. Tom came out with us. I haven't heard from him in a
                    long, long time. He was very calm and relaxed and was a good leader. He gave the
                    feeling of “everything will work out if we remain calm.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had we made at this time any contact with the MPLA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Yes. At one stage, just before I got there, the three groups came
                    together in Luanda and set up a committee to organize the government, except
                    that on one fateful night, the MPLA shelled the compounds of the other two
                    groups who had to flee to the forest again. So, only the MPLA stayed in Luanda.
                    We knew who they were, sure. Killoran was in close touch with them.</p>
                <p>Q: Sometimes, you have a situation where the people on the ground (the people at

                    Was there any of that or was it pretty well agreed?</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>ROGERS: I don't think our opinion was asked. We were just told to leave. For a
                    time, it was proposed (I don't know who proposed it.) that I stay behind. Then
                    the Secretary of State himself said, “No.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Probably from 1976. After I came back, I worked in AF on Angola problems
                    and then was a Zaire desk officer for a while awaiting the arrival of the person
                    who was assigned that job. In the spring of 1976, I became an inspector, and did
                    that until August of 1978.</p>
                <p>*** [December 4, 1997 session]</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's 1976. You're off to be an inspector. How did that

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: I had just come back from Angola and was the Zaire country director
                    temporarily awaiting the arrival of Ed Marks, who was going to take over. At
                    that time I started that particular job, it was 1976.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the role of the inspectors at this time? It has changed over time.
                    Could you talk about how you saw the role and what inspectors were doing in this
                    1976-1978 period?</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>ROGERS: We would have a team with a leader, the senior officer often, but not
                    always, a former ambassador. We would divide the work up among various sections
                    of the embassy and its components - political, economic, consular - those are
                    the functions I usually looked after. Someone else would do administrative and
                    audit work. We would also divide up looking at, if they were there, other
                    elements of the country team to the extent that that was deemed helpful. Part of
                    the issue, as I always saw it, was not merely fault-finding, which is not
                    helpful, but to help people do a better job, to try to assist them in efficient
                    and practical ways to do their work, maybe to stimulate, encourage, and cheer
                    them up, and if they had special problems, try to address them either at post or
                    when they got back. So, in part, it was a visit from the “home office” to try to
                    help them do a better job, to understand their task and to get them to focus on
                    it. The important part of the exercise was the pre-inspection mode where they
                    had to write a few papers and think about where they were and what they were
                    supposed to be doing. That process in itself was helpful as sort of a
                    self-evaluation critique. Of course, very rarely, once in a great while, it
                    would turn up some unfortunate situation which had to be addressed by perhaps
                    sending someone home or dealing with it properly whether it was a health matter
                    or a severe disciplinary problem or, once in a while, misconduct.</p>
                <p>Q: One has to in this type of thing focus on more or less the more unusual rather
                    than the normal because the normal is you go around and make sure the files are
                    in order and that they're doing what they're doing. But did you find on what we
                    will call the substantive side any problems with embassies, posts, not really
                    focusing on what they should be doing, getting more involved in internal
                    administrative stuff and not reaching out as much? Was this ever a problem?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: One example was in Teheran. I was an inspector there. Just a few months
                    before the fall of the Shah and the complicated problems that happened after
                    that, my impression was that there were a lot of wonderful people at the
                    embassy, but they didn't realize what was coming down the pike. There was
                    enormous dissent in the population. We were so closely tied to the Shah, in
                    effect, saying, “We'll let him have whatever he wants,” not realizing that we
                    all have to go one way or the other, and we did not build for the future, did
                    not look at alternatives to the Shah. On the other hand, it was very difficult
                    for the embassy to do that because SAVAK (the Shah's secret police, the state
                    security service) didn't like that. I've always looked around to see what other
                    political forces might be coming along, whether they were legitimate opposition
                    or underground, just to try to evaluate them. I don't think we did that well in
                    Iran. I'm not positive much better could have been done, but we certainly missed
                    the boat.</p>
                <p>Q: When you were there at that time, the thing I've gotten from other interviews
                    and also sort of general knowledge in the Foreign Service was that both the
                    Nixon administration and Ford (and it was picked up by the Carter
                    administration) we've got to give all support to the Shah and that the Shah had
                    more or less stated a condition that “You will not report on internal things
                    within here unless you have my approval,” or something to that effect.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>ROGERS: That is a good capsule of what I've just tried to verbalize. But still,
                    the concept with the central government was, “If you want to know about the
                    opposition, come and ask us. We'll tell you about it.” That wasn't very
                    practical. But there was certainly ferment just waiting for some new messianic
                    type leader to pop up and deal with. That does underscore the reality that our
                    people did not reach out as well as they could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the inspectors came, were you seeing this as a
                        problem and discussing it with the ambassador and the Political
                        Section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Certainly with the Political Section. I don't remember whether or not the
                    team leader, Chuck Cross, discussed it with the ambassador. Normally, only he
                    would do that. He would normally debrief the ambassador, who was William
                    Sullivan at the time, a wonderful person. We went to the various posts: Shiraz,
                    Isfahan, and Tabriz in Azerbaijan. It was extremely interesting and most useful.
                    Even at that time, it wasn't very comfortable.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about 1978, aren't we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: That's right. I started being an inspector in 1976. I inspected a number
                    of posts before Teheran: Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique, and the
                    Republic of South Africa. That occurred in 1976. I remember that distinctly
                    because it was the bicentennial celebration and we just happened to be in
                    Krueger National Park on July 4, 1976. I rented a car. We were driving near
                    Soweto and people threw rocks at the car. I thought, “That's strange. Why would
                    they do that to me?” Then I suddenly realized, “I probably look like a nice,
                    chunky white South African.” On that particular trip, my wife, Millicent, and
                    daughter, Kate, came along to see South Africa. They were in Pretoria. We went
                    through Krueger National Park, which was absolutely fascinating. At that time,
                    Bill Bowdler was ambassador in Pretoria and Bill Edmondson was his DCM. Two
                    years later, Edmondson became the ambassador there. Incidentally, I see Bill
                    Bowdler from time to time. We happen to live near each other in the northern
                    neck of Virginia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: No. There were tremendous traffic jams. Everywhere we went, we had SAVAK
                    guards with us almost without exception. I think the only time that I didn't
                    have some kind of bodyguard with me was when I went off to see the rug museum.
                    But by and large, it was a cheerless place, oppressive.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: On a personal side, I think they lived pretty well. But again, their
                    activities seemed to be somewhat curtailed. I think they stayed pretty much at
                    home and just visited friends. I don't think they got out as much as they
                    perhaps should have. Some of them later became hostages, some of those that I
                    knew very well. But it seemed to be a restrictive atmosphere all in all. I was
                    glad I got to see it. I just had a feeling that it was going to blow up in some
                    way. The lid was going to come loose. Indeed, that is what happened some months
                    later.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: No. That happened the first time perhaps three months aftewe left.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any question on the part of the inspectors about curtailing our

                <p>Q: We're going to go back now. In South Africa, this was during the Carter
                    administration, which was very strong on civil rights and all. How did you find
                    that was translated in a country that was still ruled by apartheid?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: During that time, they were trying to get American companies to disinvest
                    and to isolate the country. Some of the U.S. companies did indeed cooperate with
                    that while we were there. I remember that being a very big issue. I liked South
                    Africa. It is a very beautiful area physically, but terribly sad the way the
                    system worked. I remember that we had an African driver assigned to us. I
                    realized how hard their life was when if we got back too late, he would have to
                    stay in the embassy overnight. He couldn't go home, then. So, we became
                    sensitive to not staying out after a certain point so he could go home. The
                    country was very beautiful. We went to Cape Town and Durban as well. We traveled
                    extensively throughout. William Stokes was our team leader at that time. I
                    inspected the Political Section, among others. They were certainly committed to
                    looking for greater democratic expression and peaceful resolution. There was a
                    great concern that the struggle would turn out to be very brutal and bloody.
                    That was of enormous concern. Mercifully, it wasn't quite so bad in the end.</p>
                <p>Q: I was in INR back in the early 1960s. When we talked about South Africa, we
                    talked about the night of long knives. This seemed to be inevitable there.</p>
                <p>ROGERS: And it would have been a great tragedy. It worked out reasonably well.
                    We're now seeing these events in the Truth Commission. So much of that is
                    becoming general knowledge.</p>

                <p>Q: This is today's story about Winnie Mandela, the former wife of Nelson Mandela,
                    and her dictatorial rule over her followers and allegations of murder and all of
                    that.</p>
                <p>Where else did you inspect on other trips?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. That was also very interesting. I had
                    never been to Indonesia. It was just delightful to experience an enormous
                    country, a very diverse and different country with marvelously interesting music
                    and theater arts (masks, shadow plays). I knew nothing about that and was just
                    so delighted to learn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in Indonesia, Suharto had been in power
                        about 1years. Was there any concern about our ties with Suharto at that

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: No, I don't think so. Issues of geopolitical concern included the Chinese
                    minority which had been suppressed by the government a lot in the past and the
                    issue over Timor and even West Irian, the western half of the island of New
                    Guinea. We had an enormous aid program at that time. The vastness of the country
                    - 3,000 miles long and very heavily populated - was fascinating to see. I think
                    Indonesia is one of the countries that the U.S. generally doesn't pay too much
                    attention to, but should.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any concern while you were dealing with that whole area about
                    Vietnam? We pulled out of there in 1975 and you were there in about
                    1972-1974?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: Approximately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any concern about communist influence

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: No, I don't think so. But it had earlier when the massacres of the
                    Chinese in general occurred. A lot of it was ethnic struggle. A lot had to do
                    with communist suppression. But that happened many years before we got
                    there.</p>
                <p>Q: On these inspections, how did we deal with problems such as alcoholism? Would
                    you be briefed and on the lookout for this as a problem?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: We knew of one or two people who had such a problem. I must say, they
                    were on very good behavior when we were there, being perhaps alert to that.
                    There was one secretary along the way who had a terrible drinking problem. I did
                    suggest her transfer and that did occur. She died shortly thereafter from
                    cirrhosis. But that was the only one I recall.</p>

                        that aall on our radar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: No, I was never aware of that happening. I don't think anyone gave it a
                    thought. If someone were to mistreat someone, whatever the basis might have
                    been, that wouldn't be tolerated, but I never was aware of any sexual harassment
                    of any type.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: As a footnote, not as an inspector, but at one post our principal officer
                    was notorious for patting the behinds of all the wives, so they all avoided him
                    very quickly as they went through receiving lines. He is still living. He is a
                    wonderful fellow. I liked him very much, but he had that strange quirk.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Were there any major problems that you saw that you and you colleagues were
                    discussing about the structure or how the Foreign Service was performing in this
                    period?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: People were terribly concerned about being selected out. Time in class
                    was a big issue. I guess it still is. I know it still is. They felt that, “If I
                    don't get a good assignment so that I can be noticed and, thus, have an
                    opportunity to be rated highly, I'm doomed.” So, they tried to do a good job and
                    a useful one. My impression, at least during my career, is that Foreign Service
                    people are certainly not lazy. They are highly committed, motivated, or they
                    wouldn't be in this profession. There were a few people who weren't wedded to
                    the Foreign Service who didn't quite have that motivation, but my impression is
                    that they all did their very best.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were an inspector during the Carter administration,
                        which placed quite a premium on human rights. Was it part of your portfolio
                        to go out and make sure that the posts were working on human rights,
                        reporting on it? There was a certain reluctance initially with this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: That's right, but it was pointed out that it wasn't optional. It was a
                    legislative requirement to fulfill this and you have to do it because it's a
                    major component of the Annual Civil Rights Report to the Congress, which
                    curiously, I was the editor for in 1979 under Pat Derian.</p>

                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>ROGERS: Some people said, “That's interesting and we'll do it” and some said,
                    “Well, it's not important.” I said, “Whether it is or not, we have to do it and
                    we have to do it thoroughly in every respect. There is a checklist that you have
                    to go through. You can't just say everything is fine. You have to report line by
                    line on this checklist of every aspect of the human rights envelope and that
                    includes positive reporting. We're not just looking at it to be critical. Yes,
                    they're doing well in topic A, but in topic B, because of centuries-old
                    tradition, certain things happen in this culture this way. You don't have to
                    preach about it, but just try to analyze why things are the way they are.” This
                    usually had to do with the treatment of women in terms of access to education
                    and jobs. We did try to get them to focus accurately and candidly.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you getting people saying, “Yes, if we report on this, this will be
                    published and this is going to cause us problems with the government because
                    it's sort of gratuitous pointing out their flaws, which will be made public
                    knowledge and therefore it will be harder for us to work?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: I did get that. The answer was “You don't know what the final report is
                    going to say” when it goes through the country director editing, and then, the
                    Bureau of Human Rights itself will put it into context. It may or may not come
                    out the way you prepared it. You just have to conscientiously do your best. On
                    the other hand, if this is the way you feel about something, it may be
                    beneficial for that country to read about how others see them. So, I think we
                    were able to get them to focus on it. This was always a key interest area of
                    mine. I certainly stressed that.</p>
                <p>Q: While you were an inspector, you also became involved in the politics of the
                    Department of State, is that right, with AFSA (American Foreign Service
                    Association, the trade union and professional organization of most of the
                    foreign affairs agencies at that time)?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: I was a Governing Board member of AFSA for four years from 1976 to June
                    of 1979. I ran for office and was not elected the first time, but a person who
                    was elected to be a governor, a State representative, Alan Lukens, was suddenly
                    transferred to Denmark. As I had the next number of votes, though that is not
                    necessarily a criteria, I was put in his place. While I was in South Africa, the
                    then vice president of AFSA was transferred overseas, and I was made vice
                    president for about a year and a half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period, what were the major issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>ROGERS: Negotiating performance evaluation criteria, the standards that selection
                    boards would look at in order to rank order officers and staff on the basis of
                    relative merit and how to define what that means. I worked many, many hours on
                    drafting those guidelines and negotiating them. Additionally, the guidelines for
                    selection out for cause and for low ranking. Totally separate criteria were
                    used. This was an ongoing process. Each year, management would propose a change
                    and we might or might not accept it. Those were the so-called bread and butter
                    issues, but it was terribly important how a person was rank ordered. Of course,
                    no matter how wonderful you might be, if there are no vacancy opportunities,
                    there is no promotion. One of the great issues that I worked on was the Foreign
                    Service Act that is currently in place. I worked on that a great deal. I
                    remember the first discussion we had with senior management at the time,
                    including Secretary of State Vance. They were going to call it the Foreign
                    Service Reform Act. I said right at the beginning, “Please don't use the word
                    reform. The implication is that these are juvenile delinquents and they need
                    reformation. Just say 'The Foreign Service Act.'” Vance said, “That is a good
                    idea.” So, I made that one small historic contribution. One other fellow said,
                    “Let's call it 'The Improvement Act.'” I said, “No, no, just make it neutral:
                    the Act, not imply anything about reform.” Part of that was, by executive order,
                    the trade union representative for most of the foreign affairs agencies, not all
                    (AFGE, the AmericaFederation of Government Employees) represented one at that
                    time). But part of the legislation was to, by statute, make an organization (It
                    didn't specify AFSA) the collective bargaining unit by law, not just by
                    executive order. So, that was beneficial. Each foreign affairs agency could,
                    within its own constituency, elect the representative they wanted. Then, AFSA or
                    AFGE would represent the entire workforce, not just those who happened to belong
                    to the trade union representative. That is very important because you can't just
                    say, “We'll only represent those who pay their dues or happen to be members.”
                    That would not do. So, we had constant meetings on all kinds of issues. They
                    were very useful. We generally were able to do it in a collegial way, even
                    though it was inherently competitive. Management had a view and we argued it was
                    always to do what's best for the employee, officer or not officer, as best we
                    could. This was the epic that John Hemenway became the president. Many, many
                    months later, a referendum recall vote, removed him, and Patricia A. Woodring, a
                    lovely lady, became president. I could have, Lars Hydle could have, several
                    others could have, but that would have looked so bad that we were in combat on
                    this and she was not. I gave Pat a beautifully carved gavel that I had picked up
                    in Indonesia to start her presidency.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Then, I was encouraged to run for president in 1979. Strangely, it was a three
                    way race. Kenneth Bleakley won. Another fellow and I drew pretty much from the
                    same pool of employees. He was a labor officer. I was essentially a political
                    officer, though I had been a consular officer as well. We both drew from the
                    sort of middle of the group. Shortly after that election, that fellow dropped
                    dead of a heart attack. Kenneth Bleakley's position was rather more elitist and
                    he and some others had this concept of flow through, which means “Everybody who
                    is senior to me, get him out quickly so I can rise to the top.” They had this
                    concept of excellence. I said, “Everybody can't be excellent.” They accused me
                    of being “the champion of the mediocre.” I said, “Well, I'll accept that because
                    most of us are sort of mediocre. We are all more or less in the middle.
                    Sometimes the people who are self-appointed people of great excellence are full
                    of beans anyway, full of self-importance and self-selecting.”</p>
                <p>The one thing I fought very hard against at that time was the career window
                    issue, which was critically important. People didn't seem to understand that.
                    While you may elect to open your competition availability during the six-year
                    stretch, you have no idea no matter how well you do what the size of the Service
                    is going to be at that time. So, you're betting against a stacked deck. How
                    beautifully you might do and be a grand, brilliant, super performer is of no use
                    if there are few promotion opportunities. You're gone in six years. I did get
                    management to build into the legislation, at the option of the Secretary of
                    State, the opportunity to change that without going back to the Congress,
                    saying, “He or she, the Secretary of State, can direct that the career window
                    opportunity length of time can be changed upward only, depending on supply and
                    demand.” This did get into the legislation. Regrettably, as far as I know, up to
                    today, no one has taken advantage of it and used it. Thus, we see this
                    tremendous slaughter of wonderful people before their time.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the things that struck me at that time was something referred to
                    obliquely, that one of the driving political forces within the union, AFSA, was
                    relatively young, quite effective officers at the middle grades, mostly
                    political officers, who mainly just wanted to get rid of everybody so they could
                    get to the top. All of a sudden, they would become the dead wood as soon as they
                    got to the top.</p>
                <p>ROGERS: In my position, it was that the organization has a duty to all of the
                    constituency, including members and non-members alike, to do the best for the
                    employees, not for a coterie of elitists that they claimed to be. We're all
                    going to flow through eventually and our duty is to everyone, to protect
                    them.</p>

                <p>ROGERS: These were people who became staff assistants to people, the seventh

                    but not necessarily managers or anything else of that nature. They just knew how
                    to please their superiors more than anything else. They looked pretty, too. They
                    were usually well groomed.</p>
                <p>Most people are, I hope. But I think that's right. I remember several of them
                    being staff assistants. Bleakley certainly was to then Assistant Secretary for
                    East Asia and the Pacific, Holbrooke, whom I knew in Vietnam. But he is retired
                    now, too. As I say, the key issue was the matter of the very best and the
                    brightest, as they claimed to be, getting ahead. But the best and the brightest
                    will always get ahead anyway, in principle, unless something tragic happens. But
                    we had the duty to look after the grand mass. I lost that election. At that
                    time, I was working in the Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs and
                    did enjoy that job very much.</p>
                <p>Q: I'd like to come back to the period of Hemenway. What was your experience? As
                    I recall, John Hemenway came in and he had actually been selected out of the
                    Foreign Service, which was a very unusual occurrence anyway (There isn't much
                    selection out of the Foreign Service.). He came in sort of as a minority
                    candidate and appealed to the disgruntled or something. He came in with really
                    the agenda to destroy the Foreign Service and, quite frankly, was looked upon as
                    kind of a nut, paranoid and all that. Could you discuss this?</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>ROGERS: Sure. He had a coterie of friends and supporters, all of whom had
                    tragedies in their lives or felt that they had been misserved or illserved, in
                    many cases, with some justification. John Hemenway seemed to have almost a
                    vendetta to cause chaos and problems - utterly unnecessary. We used to have
                    remarkable battles in the boardroom. At that time, DACOR used to assign or
                    appoint if someone was willing to be the retired representative on the AFSA
                    board. Now, its an elected position. Glenn Wolfe was a vigorous fighter and a
                    very active retiree member. One day, John Hemenway got so vexed with him that he
                    hit him over the head with a pitcher of water. This was a bizarre event that was
                    just unforgivable. Wolfe was 80 or 90 years old, a sweet fellow. Eventually,
                    Hemenway became so destructive that we mounted a recall petition. Bill Trueheart
                    was a great help in that, along with many other marvelous and good folks, almost
                    all retired. We had big meetings in the State Department about it and tremendous
                    stress over it all. Two lawsuits popped up because of it. Both were eventually
                    thrown out, as they did not formulate a rational cause of action, but they still
                    cost us a lot of time and effort to defeat them. I think that Hemenway did
                    appeal to many people who felt that they hadn't been appreciated, maybe with
                    good reason, or sometimes people remember selectively (They remember that they
                    did a wonderful job, but they kind of forget the screwups.). Some of the people
                    were almost mesmerized by Hemenway. In the end, he left and became a taxi driver
                    and went to Howard University Law School. About once a year, I accidentally see
                    him. I say, “Hello, John, how are you doing?” He was very cranky and I said,
                    “Oh, John, stop living in the past. Forget the past. Brighten up. There is
                    another day ahead.” He grumbles. He just can't get over it. I say, “John, you
                    are planning the past. Forget it. It's a sad epic. Cheer up and get on with your
                    life.” It was a sad epic and a lot of energy misspent. I once got an efficiency
                    report and the report writer said, “He does a lovely job at his work, but he
                    spends far too much time on AFSA.” That was a poison pill. You can't say that
                    anymore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had somebody who really represents a small group of
                        very unhappy people, but one of the functions of the AFSA president is to
                        appear before Congress, talking on various things, foreign affairs, etc.
                        Often, it's really the head of the American professional Foreign Service
                        establishment talking to the Foreign Relations Committee or something like
                        that. How did this work out with somebody who was coming from a different
                        perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>ROGERS: We did have a number of hearings on various subjects, all on personnel
                    issues and the Foreign Service Act. Either Lars Hydle or I made the
                    presentations. I don't remember Hemenway ever doing that. I remember very well
                    that Claiborne Pell, a senator from Rhode Island, who, coincidentally, I met in
                    Vietnam many years earlier, was keenly interested. He asked me about what was
                    going on. I briefed him on it. Claiborne Pell's college roommate was the first
                    person killed in Vietnam. His name was Albert Peter Dewey. For many years, they
                    didn't know where he was buried. When I was in Saigon, I had been there just a
                    little while and was the only officer in the Consular Section when Claiborne
                    Pell and his group were in Laos. Mike Mansfield was the leader of that trip.
                    They sent a cable from Laos to Saigon relating to their visit. There was a
                    little footnote, “By the way, see if you can find the grave of Albert Peter
                    Dewey, Claiborne Pell's college roommate.” It was routinely sent to the Consular
                    Section. I didn't know that no one knew, but I stirred around with a French
                    friend who was a dear neighbor. He came up with a French Vietnamese Catholic
                    priest, who said, “Oh, yes, I remember that. Come on, I'll show you where he's
                    buried.” Then he gave me a copy of his death report. We actually found the
                    grave. When Claiborne Palled came, I took him to the grave and showed him where
                    it was. He was so thrilled to find it. This priest's name was Tri Core. He gave
                    me his report of this whole incident. He had taken the body. There was a false
                    report that he had been decapitated, but he wasn't. So, I sent that report to
                    Peter Dewey's father and brother, who were both living at the time. They were
                    very pleased to know that. I also sent photographs of the grave.</p>
                <p>Q: During the time you were with AFSA during this period from 1977-June 1979, did
                    AFSA get involved at all in sex discrimination, racial discrimination, anything
                    of this nature?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: Not that I recall. We had one issue about an FSO who became blind. He
                    wanted to get a helper to help him do his work. We were supportive of him. He is
                    still living.</p>

                <p>ROGERS: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were with the Bureau of Human Rights from 1979 until
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: I was in the National War College class of 1978-1979. When that ended
                    (and I was very active in AFSA then, too.), I was assigned to the Bureau of
                    Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs to be the editor of the Annual Human
                    Rights Report. Patricia Derian, a lovely lady, was the Assistant Secretary. A
                    lot of people found her controversial. I found her fabulous. I loved her.</p>
                <p>Q: I'm interviewing her.Why don't we cover the War College? What was your
                    impression, what did you get out of it?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: I loved it! Having been a naval officer earlier was not such a big switch
                    for me. I had worked on the Joint Staff before in CINCLANT. I enjoyed it very
                    much. I got on exceedingly well with the members of the armed forces and just
                    learned a lot. I enjoyed every day of it. My wife took many courses that were
                    available to spouses. I remember, we all had to write a big theme paper. I
                    selected “Can China Feed Herself,” which I thought was a good question at the
                    time. Our field trip was absolutely fabulous. It was the first official trip to
                    the People's Republic of China since George Marshall's trip in the forties. The
                    trip included two or three from each of the main services: Navy, Air Force,
                    Marine Corps, State, and CIA. Peter John De Vos and I were the two from State.
                    We had a wonderful trip through China at a time when it was just emerging from
                    the Great Cultural Revolution. The faculty member who went with us had written a
                    book about the Great Cultural Revolution, so we had expertise with us. Having
                    worked in various capacities all around the rim of China for many years, I
                    always was interested getting in there, but never had. We went to Shanghai,
                    Beijing, saw the wonderful tourist scenes such as the Great Wall, down to the
                    North Korean border at Antung, and Nanjing. They used to say, “What would you
                    like to do?” We used to sit around and I would say, “Let's give them something
                    tough to see if they'll let us do this. Let's ask them to see Mao Tse Tung's
                    cadaver because the mausoleum has been closed.” “Oh, he's not on view at the
                    moment.” I said, “Wait a minute. Mobutu Sese Seko is coming to town. Are you
                    going to show it to him?” “Yes.” “Well, let us go in after him.” “Oh, well...”
                    Then they came back the next day and said, “Okay, we'll do it.” So, Mobutu went
                    in and then our little group trudged along after he came out. We asked to see
                    the air raid shelters under Beijing and they showed us those. I said, “Let's
                    see... How about we visit a submarine?” “Oh, you can't see a submarine. That's
                    off limits.” But later they took us to the Shanghai naval base and took us down
                    in a Chinese submarine. It was a pretty rickety looking old diesel. I wouldn't
                    want to go to sea in it. I don't think it was particularly seaworthy. It was
                    fascinating just to visit.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Then we went to Guangzhou (Canton) and out through Hong Kong. Jack Kubisch, who
                    is still living in South Carolina, was the State faculty representative. I knew
                    him in ARA when he was Assistant Secretary there. His staff aide then was Pete
                    De Vos, who went with him to Greece when he became ambassador there. Pete De Vos
                    replaced me in Angola, so we went back a long, long way. He has just retired. He
                    has had a fabulous career, and ambassador to five countries.</p>
                <p>The War College experience was delightful. I am very grateful that we were able
                    to do that. Some people resist senior training, say, “Oh, that takes you out of
                    the competition group,” but I think it was worth it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to the Bureau of Human Rights in 1979 and you
                        were theruntil about when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Until I went to Morocco in July of 1980.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in the Bureau of Human Rights?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: My main task was to take these reports from all the posts in the world
                    and then try to make them into a coherent, readable format. Often, I would have
                    to cable back for more information for delinquent reports. It was exceedingly
                    interesting. I learned so much about countries I knew nothing about. Then I had
                    to work the report through the country director, though not necessarily to
                    “clear” it. Sometimes, they didn't like it and I said, “Well, that's the way it
                    is.” Sometimes, they would say, “Can't you put a little more balance here and
                    there?” We tried to be very objective. I was very strict about it. So was Pat
                    Derian. Some of the posts did a much better job than others which required a
                    great deal of editorial work. It was not just compiling what everybody sent in.
                    It had to be sensible. Pat Derian and I went to the Congress when the report was
                    delivered, to testify. That was a rewarding event. I remember, there was an
                    editorial in the New York Times about it. It was very complimentary about its
                    candor. I received a letter from Warren Christopher complimenting that
                    product.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the Under Secretary of State at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Yes. I had never met him, but he wrote me a lovely letter.</p>
                <p>Q: First, could you talk about Pat Derian, how she operated and what you were
                    hearing from your colleagues within the State Department about her?</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>ROGERS: I just adored her from the start. She and I were on the same humanitarian
                    wavelength. I had earlier been a social worker. My whole orientation made it a
                    perfect fit. I was offered at the same time a good job in the Bureau of
                    Narcotics. I went with Pat Derian and just had a wonderful time doing that. I
                    helped with other aspects of the office as well, but my main task was the Human
                    Rights Report. She was fascinating. She was keenly interested in important
                    issues in Chile at the time and just wouldn't let go. She was very vigorous and
                    forceful.</p>
                <p>Richard Holbrooke was then Assistant Secretary of East Asia and the Pacific. He
                    sent to Pat Derian a memo complaining about the draft of some of the countries
                    in his portfolio which were highly critical on the human rights and rightly so.
                    But he made a comical mistake. He wrote the memo to Patrick Derian. With great
                    enthusiasm, she took a green pen and wrote on it, “Try the Irish embassy. No
                    Patricks here” and sent it back to him. I thought that was a great show of charm
                    and good humor.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought that there would have been a whole lot of emotion and
                    very difficult bureaucratic wrangling over a couple of things: one, the British
                    in Northern Ireland and, even more so, the most sensitive one, which is Israel
                    and its treatment of its political prisoners and the Palestinians. Can you
                    comment on those particular ones?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: The Israel Desk might as well have been part of the Knesset. It was just
                    blindly devoted to the cause of Israel and didn't want to have any unkind,
                    objective words. They resisted, but we wrote it up exactly as it was about their
                    rough handling of Palestinians in many respects in prisons, as well as out on
                    the street. That stuff all got in, nicely phrased, but quite accurate in my
                    view.</p>
                <p>I don't recall the UK desk commenting harshly about that at all. I knew the
                    country director for the UK, who died about two years ago, but he didn't resist.
                    That all got in. Clientism was always an issue with some people who identified
                    too much with the country with which they were working. That is a natural,
                    though unfortunate, frailty sometimes in the Foreign Service. “Oh, you can't say
                    anything bad about the country I'm working for.” But, you have to take your
                    castor oil. It's not optional. The Congress has mandated that we will write this
                    report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you were getting any pressure from the
                        verstrong pro-Israeli group in the United States and in Congress, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: A couple of organizations wanted an advance copy, but I refused to give
                    them out. You just can't do that. It's unthinkable until it's delivered to the
                    Congress. What they wanted to do was get a hold of it and use various tactics to
                    get it watered down or made into bland pat.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: I think it was the B'nai B'rith League or the Hillel Foundation, one of
                    those groups or both.</p>

                <p>ROGERS: No.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: They may have directly and privately contacted her. I have no knowledge
                    of that. But she was very, as far as I'm concerned, objective, balanced, and
                    would not continence any interference. I'm not aware of any diluting of any
                    report that I prepared because of any outside influence.</p>

                <p>ROGERS: I can't remember now. There may have been.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Chile and Argentina. Those were both tough reports. But I knew the
                    southern part of Latin America pretty well from my earlier assignments, so that
                    was helpful. I had been in all those countries. Other than Israel, I don't
                    remember any effort to change... It may have happened and it just didn't get to
                    me. I was told, “Do it accurately and fairly.” We also got some information
                    separately from Amnesty International because they also had some helpful
                    material. I would not accept it as accurate until I would go back to the embassy
                    for confirmation or comment. So, we would feed that back. Sometimes it was
                    confirmed. Sometimes the response was that we just don't know.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time (1979/1980), were you of the impression that
                        you were part of a movement that was beginning to focus on a world basis on
                        human rights abuses?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>ROGERS: I certainly did and I was very pleased to be a part of it. It was most
                    memorable. I think it was an important period in the awakening. Pat Derian was
                    very strong. I think President Carter let her do her own thing and he was most
                    supportive. At that time, her husband, Hodding Carter, was the press secretary
                    to the Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>Q: I can think of one thing where just from a purely tactical point of view, not
                    from the clientitis or anything else, but during this period that you're talking
                    about, we had 50 or 60 hostages in Iran. Obviously, there were human rights
                    abuses and everything else in Iran at that time. I would have thought there
                    would have been some concern because of the situation of not putting gasoline on
                    the fire. Did we just take the human rights off the agenda?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: I'm going to have to try to reconstruct that. I think thathey were out by
                    the time...</p>
                <p>Q: No. The hostages left in January 1981 on Inauguration Day. I have some vague
                    recollection that the report was either put in the deep-freeze or something. Of
                    course, we didn't have an embassy there to write it up.</p>
                <p>ROGERS: A complete report on Iran is in the text at page 744-749. Iis tough and
                    not watered-down. I prepared it.</p>
                <p>Q: If you could find out what happened and you can add it when you have this for
                    editing. I think it is an important thing to understand on these reports.</p>
                <p>What was Pat Derian's management technique? How did she operate?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: She was very cheerful, friendly, and warm. There were colorful people in
                    that office who came in with the administration, all very nice. Perhaps one or
                    two were eccentric. But it gave a lot of flavor to the office. I enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought the one problem that you might have is people coming out
                    of the generation of the 1960s and having some people who were crusaders, with
                    no compromise, no understanding of the diplomatic niceties, and a certain amount
                    of a lack of balance. Did you have problems with that?</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>ROGERS: In that office, there were only two FSOs: Charles Salmon and myself. He
                    later became ambassador to Laos. In fact, I was offered his job when he left by
                    Pat Derian, but my eight years were up in the U.S. and I had to go overseas. I
                    think that some people in other bureaus were very upset with Pat Derian. They
                    felt that she was rocking the boat and didn't have an overall geopolitical
                    understanding of the Cold War. Of course, she did. That was her job, to do that.
                    They were quite separate in many respects, but she didn't let that bother her.
                    Somebody had to do it and it might as well have been her. Sure, a lot of the
                    middle rank officers in the Foreign Service thought this was not a useful and
                    good thing to be doing. Human rights? What's that? Fortunately, she stuck to her
                    guns and kept going. I was very proud of working in that office.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is December 15, 1997. At the end of June 1980, you
                        wenoff to Morocco. You were in Morocco until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: To July 1985.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow. Was this just a regular assignment or had you sought
                        it?How did it come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: It was one of many listed and it sounded interesting. I was then in the
                    Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs. I bid on that one. I had to go
                    overseas. I had been in the States eight years. It sounded exceedingly
                    interesting. It was just routinely assigned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling that you were on somebody's shit
                        lisfor being in the Bureau of Human Rights?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: That is theoretically possible. Somebody could have been annoyed because
                    I wrote about the country for which they had great affection or concern. I
                    thought that would be a nice assignment.</p>
                <p>Q: I would think it would be a very good assignment. I was just wondering whether
                    places like the Middle East were out of bounds because of the human rights
                    reports.</p>
                <p>ROGERS: I wasn't aware of that. Of course, I didn't speak Arabic,so a significant
                    assignment in the Middle East wasn't realistic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job in Morocco?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>ROGERS: I was principal officer in Tangier responsible for that portion of
                    Morocco which used to be Spanish Morocco, everything from the Atlantic almost to
                    the Algerian border. I had five large provinces plus, for interesting reasons,
                    Gibraltar and the five Spanish so-called “places of sovereignty” in northern
                    Morocco: Ceuta, Melilla, the Charafina Islands, Pena de Gomez, and Al
                    Huceima.</p>
                <p>Q: When you arrived there, what was the situation in your consular district?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: My predecessor had already left, and retired to Florida. I never did know
                    him. The main problems at that time were mostly consular, but some political
                    reporting. The consular problems were mainly associated with young Americans
                    getting in trouble with drugs, which is true in many, many areas of the world
                    and particularly so there. Kif (converted hashish) was readily available. Folks
                    would sell it to young Americans and get a reward from the police for turning
                    them in. It was just a vicious cycle. Moroccan jails were not attractive. They
                    were really hard. I had visited a Moroccan jail while in the Navy when I went
                    there in 1953 waiting for a plane to take me to my ship. I was asked to go see a
                    U.S. Navy enlisted man who had murdered somebody. He was in the French prison in
                    what was then called “Port Lyautey.” It now has a different name, Kenitra. I
                    went into this enormous prison deep underground. There he was. He was a medical
                    corpsman, so they put him to good use in their hospital ward. It was interesting
                    that many years later, I went back and visited jails in Morocco.</p>
                <p>Q: Tangier had the reputation for being a place where you had a really dissolute
                    foreign society of British and other remittance men and women and sort of a wild
                    sexual life and so on. Had those days gone?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: No, there was still a little of that, but I think their wild days had
                    long been over. They were pretty old by then. But some very famous people lived
                    there. Paul Bowles lived across the street from us. We were good friends. There
                    was a handful of other minor luminaries in the literary world. Paul was the most
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were Paul's works?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: “The Sheltering Sky” was one. There were many, many others. He was a very
                    pleasant and rather frail man. He was always interesting. He was married to Jane
                    Bowles [Note: Bowles died in 1999], who died some months before we arrived, so I
                    never knew her. She had a literary following of her own. But obscure American
                    literary talent was never of great interest to me, except a few of the Beatniks
                    that I happened to meet in the early 1950s, such as Jack Kerouac and Alan
                    Ginsberg.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>Tangier also had the old legation diplomatic property. It is now a museum, still
                    operated by the Foreign Buildings of the Department of State. It is a beautiful
                    old place of maybe 50 rooms on Zankat America. It was the gift of a sultan in
                    about 1820. It is a museum operated by the Tangier American Legation Museum
                    Society. Ben Dixon is the U.S. agent. That was an interesting small aspect of
                    it, to help keep that running.</p>
                <p>One major responsibility was Gibraltar. Access from Spain to Gibraltar did not
                    exist. It was closed until 1984. Therefore, because no American consul from
                    Spain could have access to it, theoretically it was the responsibility of
                    London. Nonetheless, we did it from Tangier because we were neither British nor
                    assigned inside Spain, so it worked out very nicely.</p>
                <p>We had major ship visits. That was another huge project. Tangier is at the
                    Straits of Gibraltar. When major units of the Mediterranean Fleet would transit
                    in and out, they would stop at the Straits of Gibraltar, exchange various
                    things, and go their opposite way. Years ago, I had known on a submarine a
                    fellow who then became the Chief of Naval Personnel. I wrote to him and said,
                    “Why don't you have them come in and stay, buy a rug and have some fun?” So,
                    many, many ship visits occurred while I was there. His name is Lando Zech. He
                    later became head of the Atomic Energy Commission (The Nuclear Regulatory
                    Commission). So, we enjoyed those visits. It was a good break for the Navy
                    instead of going straight back. They could bring some souvenirs home. At one
                    time with one visit, we had the largest ever group of nuclear powered warships
                    ever in one post at one time. Normally, that doesn't happen because they are
                    such an enormous target. We had four cruisers and two aircraft carriers and two
                    submarines all at once. All were nuclear powered. It was such an interesting
                    event that the Chief of Naval Operations came from Washington to visit. We had a
                    reception at our government residence for him, the Commander of the Sixth Fleet,
                    the officers of the various ships, and the senior naval officer of COMSOUTH. It
                    was a lot of fun for all.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>When I arrived, Angier Biddle Duke was ambassador. I really appreciated him. He
                    did such a wonderful job. He, tragically, was killed while rollerblading in New
                    York last year. Marvelous person. He was very, very kind to me. He was replaced
                    by Joseph Verner Reed. Just before Joseph Reed arrived, my wife became
                    critically ill. She contracted a disease called “Guillain Barr�,” which is named
                    after two French doctors who identified it. She became totally paralyzed from
                    the neck down. A local doctor said it could be polio. Unlikely. She had had a
                    polio vaccination. But he said, “You have to get her on a ventilator.” I said,
                    “Okay, get one over here.” He said, “None exists in northern Morocco, not one.
                    No hospital has one.” So, I put her into a car and drove her to Rota, Spain,
                    which had a good naval hospital. She was there for a long, long time. So, Joseph
                    Reed, whom I had never met, called me up in the hospital and said, “What do you
                    want to do? Do you want to go home or stay there and tough it out?” I said,
                    “I'll stay here.” I stayed with her in Spain for some weeks. He said, “Fine,
                    we'll do what you want.” While I was in Rota, a telegram chases me down. It
                    said, “Do you have any objections of being named chief of mission in Guinea
                    Bissau?” I said, “Sorry, I can't do it.” So, that was the end of that. I thought
                    it was weird that Guinea Bissau - GB - and Guillain Barr� - GB... She suffered
                    terribly. It was just miserable for her for many, many weeks. Then she spent
                    many months in a wheelchair. Mercifully, today she is in very good shape,
                    although a bit frail. We eventually got her back to Morocco. Happily, because we
                    lived right next to the office, I could go back and forth and check on her
                    during the day.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the Moroccan officials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: No problem, quite pleasant. They were enormously cooperative. When I
                    showed an interest in a particular person, we had quick access. Sometimes, they
                    let people off a little bit easily if they were young and stupid if they
                    promised not to come back (I'm talking about the hashish nonsense.). I never had
                    difficulty. I became very good friends with many of the officials. Similarly
                    with Gibraltar. I reported on the internal elections of Gibraltar. The elections
                    have always been fascinating to me. I predicted that after many, many years,
                    finally a new person would be elected Chief Minister, of a totally different
                    party: Joe Bossano, an obscure dock worker/labor leader. He was allegedly a
                    communist. I said, “Well, we're going to work on that.” With the blessing of
                    Embassy London, I got him on a travel grant around the States. His escort
                    officer was Perry Stieglitz, a retired USIA officer. Bossano did become Chief
                    Minister. He embraced democracy and capitalism. Perry Stieglitz is now and has
                    been for some years the representative of Gibraltar in the United States. Fun
                    story.</p>

                <p>ROGERS: Two were significant: Cesta and Mellowly. For years, there has been
                    tension, enormous combat in the 1920s between Morocco and Spain in northern
                    Morocco. A lot of fictional stories and movies have been produced about them,
                    but they are 80% nonsense. When Spain gave up northern Morocco to Moroccan
                    sovereignty, many thousands of Spaniards who lived in northern Morocco migrated
                    to Cesta and, to a lesser extent, Mellowly. So, they still have very important
                    relations. They are free ports. They have very strong military emplacements
                    there. It would be very tough for the Moroccans ever to take those two. On the
                    others, Pena de Gomez is a peninsula with a tiny fortress, a small chapel, 16
                    soldiers, and one sergeant. At high tide, it is an island. It has been there for
                    centuries. All these places were originally Portuguese. The Portuguese and
                    Spanish crowns merged. They became Spanish and have remained so ever since. The
                    Charafina Islands... There are three. One is a cemetery and the other two are
                    just a few fishermen. That is very near the Algerian border, visible from the
                    shore. The other interesting one is the island fortress of Al Huceima, which is
                    in the Bay of Al Huceima. It looks like an old stone battleship. You can visit
                    all of those places if you want to by taking a small vessel from Cesta, which
                    makes its mail run.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Moroccans making noises about taking them over or
                        did they really care?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: I think they didn't care. It's income generating. Cesta and Mellowly are
                    free ports. No one can enter those other places at all except by sea. When Spain
                    would make a lot of noise about reversion of Gibraltar, Morocco would say, “Oh,
                    we can't have the same sovereign nation state on both sides of the Straits of
                    Hercules. Thus, the British better stay there.” Yes, they would rattle sabers,
                    maybe every few years, but no one ever took it seriously. They are all charming
                    places and well worth a visit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that area, was there pressure from the Algerians within

                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>ROGERS: No, there was no pressure, but there was minor smuggling on the frontier,
                    just local tradesmen selling mostly local products (food and beverage) across
                    the frontier. I did have one interesting incident on that border. I had a call
                    from the embassy saying, “Please get in your car and go to the Algerian border.
                    You will be allowed to cross the border and you will pick up somebody and take
                    him to Rabat.” I said, “Who?” They said, “When you see him, you'll know him.”
                    So, I zipped over there, crossed the border, sat in the customs area on the
                    Algerian side, and in walked Vernon Walters. I knew who he was. Everybody knows
                    his face. I drove him to Rabat. When he arrived, we got across the border and he
                    said, “I am so glad to be with a safe driver.” Apparently, the Algerian police
                    had driven very fast. He said, “There must be something very important done
                    first.” I said, “Yes, Sir. What?” He said, “Take me to breakfast.” I took him to
                    breakfast. I said, “What is this important thing we have to do?” He said, “We
                    just did it: breakfast!” He was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed him. He was a
                    great storyteller of endless comic tales. If there was such a guy as THE
                    raconteur, it is Vernon Walters. I took him to Rabat and we have been friendly
                    ever since.</p>

                <p>ROGERS: When the shootdown in the so-called “Death Zone” between Benghazi and
                    Tripoli in the Gulf of Sidra occurred, the Moroccans were thrilled. They thought
                    that was great. That showed power. During this time, and to a lesser extent
                    today, the Algerians strongly supported the Polisario and what was the Spanish
                    Sahara. That struggle was going on all the time I was there. I believe it is in
                    the cease-fire stage now and a plebiscite to be administered by the United
                    Nations, the key issue being who really is a Polisario person, who is a
                    resident, voter eligible in Western Sahara. Some say that Algeria wanted access
                    to the Atlantic, which would have been a strategic concern and something that,
                    thus, with the Eastern Bloc would have access to the Atlantic for obvious value
                    reasons. That no longer matters. As with so many of these things, the hot items
                    faded into ashes when the Cold War cooled down. Joseph Verner Reed was a
                    fascinating ambassador.</p>

                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>ROGERS: He was a senior official in Chase Manhattan Bank, a big Republican
                    supporter. He was very close to David Rockefeller, who often visited. He was a
                    very gracious person. He would travel a lot, worked very, very hard. Many people
                    found him too colorful, but I found him delightful. David Rockefeller was not
                    colorful. He was very bland and quiet. Joseph Reed was very flamboyant and full
                    of endless ideas and designs. When he left in 1985, he took a job for the
                    administration at the United Nations as Under Secretary for Political Affairs on
                    the UN staff. George Bush had visited Morocco, and they were good friends. When
                    George Bush became President, Joseph Reed became Chief of Protocol. At the end
                    of that assignment, he went back to the UN and has had several different jobs
                    there. He still has more or less a protocol historical job at the rank of Under
                    Secretary.</p>

                    City.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the things that I've gotten through these interviews has been that
                    there seems to be a slight pattern. That is, our Arabic-speaking career
                    ambassadors who have gone to Morocco usually don't get along too well with King
                    Hassan, whereas our political appointees get to the point where they're
                    practically talking about “our King.” They become very defensive about Morocco
                    and King Hassan. These are the stories. I have never served there. He much
                    prefers people who are more amenable to identifying with Morocco from the
                    ambassadors than sort of a cold-eyed professional. With Reed, did you see any of
                    this overidentification with Moroccan interests or not?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: I think he saw Morocco and King Hassan [Note: King Hassan died in 1999]
                    as good friends of the U.S., very helpful in delicate matters, especially in
                    regard to Israel, and as a good counterbalance to the more radical Arab nation
                    states. It is interesting historically to turn the clock back a few centuries.
                    Morocco was the only country in North Africa that wasn't conquered by the
                    Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Turks stopped at what is now the Algerian border.
                    They were defeated there and never went in. Thus, my theme is that Morocco is
                    different from all the others that had this overlay of Turkish hegemony and is
                    very proud of that. Of course, they have a very ancient civilization. Fez was
                    founded in about 600. There is a very ancient university there. It is relatively
                    tolerant of westerners and has vigorously suppressed the sharp fundamentalist
                    inroads. When I was there in 1984, there was severe rioting in several parts of
                    Morocco. Some of the worst was in Tetouan, which was in my consular district. I
                    drove over there. The Moroccan gendarmes were machinegunning groups from
                    helicopters. It was a general revolt that was sharply suppressed. And brutally.
                    It didn't get too much press play.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reason for the revolt?</hi>

                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>ROGERS: My memory is that it was a number of things. One was a reduction in a
                    subsidy on basic foodstuffs (tea, sugar, oil, and flour), which meant that real
                    market prices jumped radically and right away. That was the straw that broke
                    this camel's back. There were other issues, such as suppression of various
                    elements that wanted a different system, probably some aspects of religious
                    fundamentalism, too.</p>
                <p>Q: I think it was 1982 when there was the invasion of Lebanon by Israel and the
                    expulsion of the PLO from Beirut. It was a full-scale war between the PLO, the
                    Lebanese, and Israel. How did that play when you were there in Morocco?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: Let's have a little background. Many of the Moroccan families of
                    prominence for six or seven hundreds years had lived in southern Spain. When the
                    “conquest” occurred, they moved back into northen Morocco. At the same time
                    roughly, Queen Isabel kicked the Jews out of Spain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1492 is when they were expelled.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: Yes. Many of those Jews went to Morocco. There are synagogues all over.
                    Most of the artisans and book binders were Jews who were not Arabized, but had
                    lived in the Andalusian context with the Moroccans and had been there for
                    centuries. Now go up to 1982. There was a big reaction against Jewish centuries
                    old residents. The rabbi in Tangier was stoned and hurt on the street because of
                    that incident you're talking about. There was a lot of unrest. As a result, many
                    of the jews in Morocco who had a long, long heritage moved - some to Israel,
                    some to Toronto, where there must be some kind of an extended family of Moroccan
                    Jews in Toronto. Some went to the U.S.</p>

                    in a lot of money. They were very proud of the fact - and I had to research it -
                    that, as they contend, they were the first nation to recognize the United States
                    after independence. Other scholars assert that it was the Netherlands.</p>

                    a book about Holland, “First Salute,” that it recognized us first by lowering
                    the flag to the first American warship that came by some Caribbean islands. In
                    general, they are very proud of their relations with the U.S. and feel that they
                    are a bridge between the Arab world, Islam, and the West.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any concern when Ronald Reagan was elected President? Here was

                    knew?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: I don't recall any such reaction. In fact, Hassan II got along very well,
                    eventually, with Reagan. There is a famous photo of the two of them riding
                    horses together, I think, in Arlington. We were given a big copy of that to hang
                    in the lobby. I think it was at Fort Myers that they rode the horses.</p>

                        seeduring this particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>ROGERS: Aeroflot, the Soviet airline, landed at Rabat. That was an important
                    overnight stop for them. I would go to Rabat at least twice a month for country
                    team meetings, sometimes three times. Aeroflot used the same hotel that I did.
                    Soviet ship visits were very common. I always photographed ships, especially
                    what we call “space support ships.” I took excellent pictures of all their radar
                    and other electronic antennae, etc. The Yuri Gagarin was one of them, a huge
                    space support ship. I often went down and walked on the ships and visited. I
                    don't recall ever seeing a combat vessel, but there were many auxiliary ships.
                    Once, a Soviet nuclear submarine ran aground off the Moroccan coast, lost part
                    of its bow and thus couldn't submerge. I got photos of that as it was being
                    towed out by an oceangoing tug. But it's not all one sided. The U.S.S. Sturgeon
                    lost its anchor in Tangier harbor. The anchor is flush with the hull. Thus, when
                    the anchor is lost, the underwater sound signature is very obvious. You can't
                    hide yourself. The Navy sent in a marvelous team of underwater demolition
                    fellows. They had to find the anchor. They said, “Where do you think it is?” By
                    triangulation, I showed them where the ship had been moored, where it had
                    dragged during a big storm, and they went out there and found it immediately. I
                    just happened to get it right. It took a few days to get it up. A special
                    airplane came in to take it away. That captain of that ship later became an
                    admiral. But there were frequent incidents of that nature that were illustrative
                    of the constant utility of the support that the Foreign Service can provide to
                    the Armed Forces and their needs. Unfortunately, as with many other posts,
                    Tangier was closed in roughly 1988 or 1989.</p>
                <p>Tangier is still used by the Voice of America, which built an enormous new relay
                    station just outside of the city. That was also exceedingly interesting. The
                    chief engineer of the Voice of America came to Tangier and said, “We want a new
                    station to relay from South Carolina.” Then they rebroadcast to the Eastern Bloc
                    and China. He said, “We want a place which is near a railroad, not too far from
                    the coast, has about six or eight inches of salty or saline water in it.” I
                    suppose these were engineering needs. And he wanted it flat. I said, “Come with
                    me.” I took him out and showed him such a place called Briech and that is where
                    they built it. It's there now.</p>
                <p>Q: You left there in 1985. Were there any other major incidents that happened

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You still kept involved with the State Department
                        afteretirement, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>ROGERS: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought you had had something to do with appeals and
                        thinglike this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROGERS: I did free of charge one very complicated employment termination appeal
                    partly because a friend of mine asked me to and the other part was that it would
                    be an interesting learning experience. It was a grievance that followed each and
                    every step down to the final judgment, chief of Diplomatic Security, Under
                    Secretary of State for Management, and Director General. I lost the case, but it
                    was interesting to learn how it works.</p>
                <p>But then I started my own law practice, separate from the State Department. That
                    is mostly child abuse and neglect, criminal defense, and juvenile delinquency. I
                    have done some wills and estates free for fellow church members. I also did a
                    lot of work for the largest coffee company in Japan. I worked in Japan, Hawaii,
                    and made maybe 20 trips to Jamaica for them.</p>
                <p>Q: You also have been very heavily involved with DACOR (Diplomats and Consular
                    Officers Retired), both a club and a philanthropic organization. What has been
                    the role of DACOR when you've been involved with it?</p>
                <p>ROGERS: I'll go back to 1986. Bill Trueheart, a wonderful person, asked me to
                    have lunch with him. I did a will for his sister free because she was an old
                    friend and he said, “Now I want you to come to DACOR with me.” He was then the
                    president. He was trying to get some recruitment going. I joined. Suddenly, I
                    was on the Membership Committee. About six years ago, I became a governor. John
                    Burke died about four years ago and I became chairman of the Membership
                    Committee, chairman of the Bylaws Committee. I wrote the bylaws. They really
                    didn't exist before. I wrote them for the DACOR, Inc. and the DACOR Bacon House
                    Foundation, currently an $11-12 million unit. I do their legal work for no
                    charge, including long negotiations with the city government on trying to get us
                    out of real estate taxes on our house at 1801 F St. In April 1997, I was elected
                    vice president [Note: and president in 1999]. The task can be as busy as you
                    want it to be. We have major programs in educational grants and fellowships,
                    have provided an enormous amount of money each year to three clusters of
                    colleges and universities, one to what I would characterize as the black
                    colleges of the Appalachia region, another to those colleges around Washington,
                    DC, and the third anywhere in the country. Separately, we administer huge
                    bequests to specific colleges (Yale comes to mind.) for benefactors who have
                    left a specific sum. We help to identify youngsters who will benefit from those
                    scholarships. If they do well, they keep it. If they don't, they lose it. There
                    are one year rollovers. Additionally, we have a very good program committee,
                    marvelous speakers. Mike McCurry was one of our speakers not too long ago. He is
                    a member of DACOR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mike McCurry being...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>ROGERS: Press secretary to the President. He happens to live near me. Mike
                    McCurry is as active as he can be. About 92% of the members of DACOR are
                    retired. About 8% are on active duty. That fluctuates slightly every year. We
                    also have programs where we support educational grants by the American Foreign
                    Service Association. I am glad to say that we support ADST's Oral History
                    Program as its largest donor, and the joint ADST-DACOR Book Series.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is our organization doing this here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I guess this is probably a good place to stop.</p>
                <p>ROGERS: Great.</p>
