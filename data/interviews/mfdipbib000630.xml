                <p>Interviewed by: Quentin Bates </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Quentin Bates interviewing Ernest Koenig, a fellow
                        retiree of the Foreign Agricultural Service of the Department of
                        Agriculture. Ernest, you had a very unusual childhood, education and so
                        forth, from the point of view of most of us. Why don't you give us a little
                        bit of background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: I think this is appropriate because my background is different from that
                    of our colleagues. I was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1917. The year of my birth
                    coincided with extraordinary circumstances. The French were militarily
                    exhausted. In Russia the revolution had broken out. The country of my birth,
                    Austria, was tottering at the brink of disaster. Moreover, the entry of the
                    United States into the war sealed the defeat of Germany and Austria. I grew up
                    in Czechoslovakia where I spent a happy childhood in southern Moravia, not far
                    from Vienna but on the Czech side. Then I went to Br�nn (Brno), the capital of
                    Moravia, where I attended the Masaryk College, an outstanding school that
                    emphasized humanistic studies. In 1936, I started my studies at the German
                    Charles University in Prague.</p>
                <p>In 1938, I decided to spend two summer months in France in order to improve my
                    French. That was the time of the Munich crisis. At the end of these two months,
                    Czechoslovakia had lost a large part of its territory, and I did not return
                    home. It was difficult to stay in Paris because I had no money and was not
                    allowed to work. Nevertheless, I registered at the Sorbonne. But I did not study
                    much because I had many other things on my mind. Finally living in Paris became
                    almost impossible, so I decided to return to Czechoslovakia and see my parents
                    again. I was about two weeks there, when the Germans occupied the rest of the
                    country in March of 1939. I succeeded in escaping from Czechoslovakia under very
                    adventurous circumstances and with much luck, and returned to France. In France
                    my life as a refugee continued. It was difficult, but I was twenty-two years old
                    and I was in Paris, so life was fun in spite of everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can imagine.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>KOENIG: On September 1, 1939 Hitler attacked Poland. I volunteered for the army.
                    But it was not quite clear for which army I had volunteered. There was a
                    Czechoslovak Consulate in Paris, but it had no legal status nor really any
                    status whatsoever. It represented a non-existing country and a non-existing
                    government. Still they accepted declarations for volunteering for “the army.”
                    Following an obscure agreement between the French Government and some Czech
                    representatives in Paris, it was decided that Czechoslovak citizens must join a
                    Czechoslovak army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a government in exile?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: There was no government in exile. That came much later. In contrast to
                    Poland, which had a well established and internationally recognized government
                    in exile following its defeat and occupation by Germany, the Czechs had nothing.
                    The French then decided to establish a Czechoslovak army in exile. This decision
                    was somewhat ambiguous because you couldn't establish the army of a country that
                    did not exist any longer. The probable purpose of this action was to organize
                    Czech speaking units through which France would be able to influence conditions
                    in Central Europe at the end of the war. On the other hand, the French might
                    also have thought of using this army as a bargaining tool in case of a separate
                    peace with Germany. The army was in reality a French unit with Czech command
                    language. It was badly organized and badly equipped. However, when France was
                    about to lose the war, it remembered this army and sent its two or three
                    regiments to the front near Paris in order to defend the capital. Of course, the
                    Czech units like the rest of the French army broke down.</p>
                <p>With the assumption of power by the Vichy government conditions in France changed
                    completely. There were millions of foreigners in France, and there was heavy
                    unemployment after the defeat. The Vichy government therefore tried to get rid
                    of as many foreigners as possible by making it difficult for them to live in
                    France. I registered at the University of Grenoble. As student I had permission
                    to stay in France in contrast to many foreigners whose stay in France was
                    questioned by the authorities. I had no money. I was allowed to study but not to
                    work in France. I did not know what to live from. I tried to earn some money as
                    a door-to-door salesman but I was unable to make ends meet in this way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your military status at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>KOENIG: I was demobilized. I had a French demobilization certificate. I learned
                    of a job in western France. A family needed a tutor for an eight-year-old boy. I
                    wrote them and they accepted me. However, a foreigner was not allowed to travel
                    unless he was in possession of a special travel permit issued by the police.
                    Since I could not tell the police that I had obtained a job, I told them I
                    needed to travel in order to visit my sick aunt. They requested a certificate
                    from my “sick aunt's” physician confirming that she was sick. Since I could not
                    provide such a document, I traveled without permission.</p>
                <p>The family that had accepted me lived on a big estate. There was plenty of food,
                    and I ate as much as I wished for the first time in many months. The police
                    noted that there was a stranger in the village. Since my permission to stay in
                    France depended on my being a student in Grenoble and not a tutor, and since I
                    had not obtained permission from the police to leave Grenoble, they arrested
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were Vichy police?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: Indeed, this was the Vichy police. They sent me to the worst French
                    concentration camp, the Camp du Vernet. When I arrived, I was told that I was
                    sent there by mistake and that I would be transferred to a better camp. This
                    promise was often repeated but never kept. It is true, I was granted certain
                    facilities: I became assistant postmaster, a job which kept me busy and lifted
                    somewhat my morale, because unlike others I was permitted to circulate freely
                    throughout the camp. But it did not alleviate the all-pervasive hunger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were most of the prisoners? Was there any particular
                        group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: At the beginning of the war the camp contained primarily Nazis, and
                    Communists who had opposed the war. After the armistice it contained people from
                    all over Europe, not only political exiles but also many unpolitical foreigners.
                    Many of the political exiles were anti-communists, for instance, Russians who
                    had fled the communists after World War I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The White Russians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: Some were still faithful to the Czar but others were democratic and
                    against the old regime. A great number of the prisoners were civilians who had
                    come with the defeated Spanish Republican army to France. Many inmates were
                    apolitical Poles and Italians who had come to France after World War I, had
                    spent most of their lives there but had never acquired French citizenship.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this before there was a general roundup of the
                        Jews?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: Yes. At that time it was basically an anti-foreigner action. However,
                    many foreigners in France were of Jewish origin. The roundup of Jews for
                    purposes of deportation to Germany came much later. In the camp the inmates were
                    not mistreated like in Germany, but the hunger was terrible. If one did not get
                    food parcels from the outside, he would die. Without outside help one could not
                    survive more than twelve-or fourteen months.</p>
                <p>The deportation to Germany started on August 7, 1942. It was not clear at all,
                    why Germany wanted to take back those whom it had expelled a short time ago.
                    Still more puzzling was the inclusion of children, old people and cripples in
                    the deportation train. We were first transported to Drancy, an infamous camp
                    near Paris, and thereafter to the east. The transport to Germany lasted three to
                    four days and took place under extremely inhumane conditions. Upon arrival one
                    part of the deportees—women, old people, children—was killed immediately, the
                    others were sent to various forced labor camps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: That was in Upper Silesia, near Auschwitz. From there I was sent to a
                    camp that was located inside a big German factory, called “Laurah�tte.” This was
                    an external camp of Auschwitz. We were slave workers. Black people recall the
                    slavery of their ancestors, but I was a slave in the twentieth century. Unlike
                    the slaves in America who had a commercial value because they could be bought
                    and sold for a price, we were of no commercial value whatsoever. If we were
                    killed, no economic loss occurred. People died from beating, from hanging and
                    from hunger. If they became unfit to work, they were gassed. After about one
                    year in “Laurah�tte,” we were transferred to Blechhammer, a camp near a big
                    factory, the “Oberschlesiche Hydrierwerke.” This camp was part of a complex of
                    camps, called Auschwitz III.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A work camp.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: A work camp to die. We worked by building a tremendous factory that
                    processed coal into oil. When Germany lost its oil resources in the east, this
                    factory became of ever greater importance. Consequently, it was repeatedly
                    bombed by the Allies. Of course, we were happy to see this happen. But on the
                    other hand, we were afraid because the bombs did not distinguish between friend
                    and foe. When the Russian Army approached Auschwitz, the Germans decided to
                    evacuate the camps. They marched thousands of people to the west. During these
                    so-called death marches in the midst of winter, most of the marchers perished.
                    When our camp was to be evacuated, I went into hiding and escaped.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I returned to Czechoslovakia. I did not like the situation there. There was still
                    a democratic form of government, but the Communist party prevailed in many
                    fields.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the European war over at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: The war was over. But many arbitrary actions occurred. I therefore
                    decided to leave. But how could I come to America? Elizabeth, my present wife
                    whom I had met in Paris, was already in America but I was unable to obtain a
                    visa because the U.S. immigration quota for Austrians, under which I fell owing
                    to my birth in Vienna, was overbooked. I managed to obtain a transit visa for
                    England where I stayed until 1948. Then I got an American visa and came to
                    America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: In 1948.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '48. Oh, was it that long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: Yes. I came to America on a boat by the name of Ernie Pyle. A new life
                    started. From the second day on I had a job. I also registered at City College
                    and at the New School for Social Research, both in New York City.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many college credits did you have? Did you have any
                        transferable credits?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: I did not have any papers with me. I explained my academic background,
                    and I was accepted on probation. I had to prove myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was your English at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: It was fluent but broken. I remember my first examination in a seminar. I
                    was supposed to make a statement. I wanted to read it, but the teacher said: “No
                    reading, you have to speak freely.”</p>
                <p>I attended school in the evening. During the day I held all kinds of odd jobs.
                    They taught me what America is like. I should mention that during the two years
                    I was at the New School, I also took a course on the political background of the
                    GATT.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that's interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: Yes, it was very interesting. I took this course without having any idea
                    of how it would help me in my work later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would have been what, 1949?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: 1949, 1950. The other thing I should mention is that my thesis was on the
                    Marshall Plan. In this way I learned a lot about contemporary Europe. After I
                    had obtained the M.A., Elizabeth's very ingenious father helped me drafting a
                    letter applying for a scholarship to the deans of the economic departments of
                    150 universities. I got three positive replies: from the University of Colorado,
                    from the University of Syracuse and from Johns Hopkins University in
                    Baltimore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The one from Colorado is interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: I accepted the one from Baltimore and obtained a junior instructorship at
                    Johns Hopkins University. I learned a lot at Hopkins, but I did not like it. It
                    was an ivory tower university and very snobbish. So I felt the time had come for
                    a real job. When you were in Baltimore, of course, you went to Washington to
                    seek a job. I had many recommendations and I got a job in the Office of
                    International Finance of the Treasury Department. This was in June, but the work
                    in the Treasury was supposed to start only in September. Since I needed money I
                    took what I believed to be a temporary two months job in the Department of
                    Agriculture. This job lasted forty years. This is very approximately my
                    background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you join the Department of Agriculture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: I joined OFAR (the Office of Foreign Agricultural Relations) of the U.S.
                    Department of Agriculture in 1951. At that time the principal work of the
                    European Analysis Branch of OFAR consisted in preparing estimates of the food
                    situation in Europe and examining food aid requests of European countries under
                    the Marshall Plan. This work was very interesting. It was largely based on the
                    methods of an Allied Committee in London which during the war had prepared plans
                    for feeding Europe's population, once Europe was liberated. What I had learned
                    about the Marshall Plan, particularly about its so-called “Counterpart Funds of
                    Local Currency” came very handy. There arose also questions concerning the
                    GATT.</p>

                        preparation of the conference that first established GATT.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: That was—I believe—in 1947.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were still in school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: No. That was before I came to America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that Hans Richter was your first boss. He was the
                        head of the European Analysis Branch. As I understand it, he was a member of
                        the U.S. delegations at some of these conferences.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: He had an excellent European background. He was an outstanding economist
                    and a very good boss. The work we did was interesting also from a purely
                    theoretical point of view. We made production estimates, which were based on a
                    special methodological approach that strengthened our analysis. As European
                    Analysis Branch we not only followed developments in Western Europe but also
                    those in Eastern Europe. The Department of Agriculture was greatly interested in
                    Eastern Europe because Eastern Europe before the war had been one of our major
                    competitors on the world markets. At a certain time we had agricultural attach�s
                    (they were not necessarily called agricultural attach�s) in Russia and also in
                    Yugoslavia, Hungary and Romania. It was feared that these countries might return
                    to the world markets. Of course, they did not.</p>
                <p>In these days it was very difficult to learn about the agricultural situation in
                    Eastern Europe. After 1948, all these countries (except Finland) were under
                    Communist rule. They reported either distorted statistics or published no
                    statistical data at all about their agricultural situation. This was the height
                    of the Cold War. In addition to the European Analysis Branch, there also existed
                    in OFAR an Eastern European Analysis Branch which dealt exclusively with
                    Russia.</p>
                <p>We also followed as well as we could the socialization of agriculture in Eastern
                    Europe. This was of great interest to us because we wanted to know whether the
                    new forms of agricultural enterprises (Collectives and State farms) might create
                    exportable surpluses in the future. Their performance turned out to be very
                    poor.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Our work also included so-called “NIS” studies. These were monographs about the
                    agriculture of foreign countries. To write such a monograph was a marvelous way
                    of learning about farming in a given foreign country. When preparing such a
                    study, we were given plenty of time and latitude. Naturally, the description of
                    agriculture in a foreign country had to be accurate and comprehensive, but
                    original research was not expected. We were lucky in having in USDA the best and
                    richest agricultural library in the world on whose resources we were able to
                    draw.</p>
                <p>In 1953, the Republicans came to power after 20 years in the wilderness. They
                    felt that the civil service was full of Democrats and...</p>

                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: No, it had not this aspect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still not yet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: McCarthy was later. The Republicans wanted more of their people in the
                    Civil Service. They RIF'd 5,000 people. At that time it was very difficult to
                    find a job in Washington. I only had two years of service, no seniority. I
                    therefore was rif'd.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in 1953? The year of the Big RIF. My position in
                        Paris was not affected by this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: But all of you had been in the Service for a longer period than I who was
                    only two years there. My situation was the more difficult as Elizabeth expected
                    a child. So I went to the then acting Administrator of OFAR, Fred Rossiter, and
                    asked him whether he could extend my employment for another month. He agreed. In
                    the course of this month I was rehired and thus never left USDA. I was so
                    shocked by this experience that I was willing to undertake any job I would be
                    asked to do in order to strengthen my position.</p>
                <p>At that time a NIS study about Indochina was to be written. In the Far East
                    Branch of OFAR nobody wanted to undertake this study. Thus I volunteered. I
                    found out that there existed excellent French literature describing the
                    agriculture of Indochina. I doubt whether the situation in any other LDC had
                    been so well described. So I became enthusiastic about my work assignment. The
                    available statistics were, however, dated. They only went up to 1940. Nothing
                    was said about the following years.</p>
                <p>At that time the French in Indochina were on their last leg. It was the time of
                    Dien Bien Phu, the big battle the French lost.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: 1953 or 1954. I recommended in my study that a big land reform should be
                    undertaken in the non-communist part of Indochina in order to fight the
                    Communists, and massive aid in the form of rice should be extended to the
                    peasants. However, I was told that policy recommendations are none of my
                    business. I should limit myself to a factual description of crops, livestock and
                    other agricultural features. By now, I realized that these instructions were
                    appropriate, but at that time I was very disappointed by them. I was very
                    discouraged and lost interest in this study. I tried to devote most of my time
                    to work on Western Europe and neglected the Indochina study, which I finally
                    failed to complete. One morning Clarence Purves, who supervised the NIS studies
                    and whom you still remember, came to my office and said: the Indochina study
                    must be completed by three o'clock in the afternoon. I protested saying that
                    this is impossible because the manuscript in my handwriting is partly illegible,
                    incomplete and the statistics are not necessarily consistent. How could this
                    study be completed in a few hours? Purves told me that six secretaries would be
                    put at my disposal who would type the study. They started to type whatever the
                    manuscript contained. At three o'clock in the afternoon a number of neatly typed
                    copies emerged with the title: “The Agriculture of Indochina.” With these copies
                    in hand Purves and I went to the Pentagon, where we were received by a colonel.
                    We handed him our copies and he transmitted them to a general who was scheduled
                    to leave two hours later for Geneva in order to participate (I think as
                    observer) in a conference on Indochina. It was at this conference that the
                    independence of North Vietnam was recognized. This was in 1954.</p>
                <p>Great changes took place in our work when OFAR was transformed into FAS (Foreign
                    Agricultural Service). This coincided with—and was perhaps even motivated
                    by—Public Law 480, which had a major impact on our work. Henceforth market
                    promotion became one of the foremost tasks of an Agricultural Attach�. PL 480
                    was prompted by the fact that after the armistice in Korea in 1953, many foreign
                    countries decided that the precautionary stocks of farm products which they had
                    kept during the Korean war, were no longer necessary. They reduced them. Hence
                    we had agricultural surpluses in America for the first time since the war.
                    Quentin, where were you in 1954-55?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Bogota, Colombia. I negotiated a PL 480 agreement
                        with that country, one of the early ones.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>KOENIG: At that time most people were unfamiliar with the methods and modalities
                    of PL 480. This is not astonishing. On the other hand, it is interesting to note
                    with how many commodities a typical agricultural attach� had to deal and with
                    how many issues he was more or less familiar. They were very numerous. In the
                    course of time we acquired significant technical knowledge which, however, did
                    not seem to us to be very special but which gave us, indeed, a considerable
                    expertise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because there were so few people who dealt with these
                        problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: Outside the Department. Of course, in the commodity divisions of FAS we
                    had several experts of world renown who possessed extraordinary knowledge of
                    certain commodity areas. Terry McKay in the field of world dairy production;
                    Henry Burke in the field of citrus and others. They were recognized as
                    authorities throughout the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did your foreign assignment begin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: In 1959. In that year the Department of State invited two German farm
                    leaders, Sonnemann and Rehwinkel, to visit the United States. Given the
                    importance of these visitors a civil servant who would also be able to interpret
                    was to be appointed to accompany them on their trip. I was selected. Upon their
                    return they expressed satisfaction with my help. Thereafter, I was appointed
                    Assistant Agricultural Attach� in Bonn with the special task to report on the
                    development of the EEC's common agricultural policy (CAP) from the vantage point
                    of Bonn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time the common agricultural policy was already in
                        force, was it not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: It was not yet in force. But U.S. agriculture feared the application of
                    this policy because it presaged a shrinking of our market outlets in Germany and
                    in Europe as a whole.</p>
                <p>The Treaty of Rome, signed in 1957, came into force on January 1, 1958. This
                    meant that beginning with 1958 the internal tariffs between the EEC countries
                    were to be gradually reduced and their tariffs vis a vis third countries were to
                    be harmonized. Tariffs on farm products were also to follow this schedule. But
                    German agriculture was mostly protected by non-tariff measures, and the Germans
                    balked. They resisted any change in their quota, licenses and admixture system.
                    They did not wish to take any steps towards a common agricultural market.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was German protection higher than that of any other common
                        market country?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>KOENIG: The internal German price level was much higher than that of other EEC
                    countries. Protection was consequently also higher. The Germans feared the
                    efficiency of French agriculture. Yet the French were not more efficient that
                    the Germans, but their price level was much lower. German resistance to a common
                    agricultural policy continued until 1961. In that year de Gaulle, who was in
                    power in France, confronted the Germans with a kind of ultimatum: either they
                    would agree to a common agricultural policy, which would entail opening their
                    markets to their partners, or the French would stop reducing their industrial
                    tariffs (in which the Germans were very interested) and also stop harmonizing
                    their external tariffs with those of their partners. In other words: the French
                    threatened to suspend the building of a common market.</p>
                <p>The U.S. Government was strongly interested in a Common Market because it wished
                    to see Western Europe united and Germany integrated in such an entity. The U.S.
                    Government also knew that without a common agricultural policy a common market
                    (i.e. the European Economic Community) would be impossible. It therefore
                    pressured Germany to accept such a policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that overrode our concern about the effects of the
                        common market on American agriculture.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: Certainly. This was clearly shown in the outcome of the first so-called
                    GATT Article XXIV:6 negotiations with the EEC. The purpose of these negotiations
                    was to grant compensation to the U.S. for the impairment of its GATT rights,
                    caused by the common agricultural policy with regard to several major
                    commodities. Instead, these negotiations suspended our claims and nullified, in
                    fact, our rights. They resulted in almost unilateral favors for European farm
                    interests.</p>
                <p>Yet before these negotiations occurred and up to 1962, the German farmers, who
                    were led by my German travel companions in America, opposed the creation of a
                    common agricultural market. Chancellor Adenauer was willing to accept it but was
                    hampered by his farmers on whose support his coalition government largely
                    depended.</p>
                <p>In the course of the negotiations between Adenauer and the farmers, the President
                    of the German Farmers' Association met frequently with Adenauer. Thereafter, he
                    would often invite me for a beer and tell me that no progress had been made
                    towards Germany's acceptance of a common agricultural policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a real inside track.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>KOENIG: A fantastic inside track, which was the more valuable as my State
                    Department colleagues reported every day that an agreement was just around the
                    corner. In retrospect, it seems possible that the Germans might have known of
                    the unjustified optimism permeating State's reporting from Bonn to Washington,
                    and thus might have wished to counteract it by giving me a more realistic
                    assessment of the situation.</p>
                <p>My boss, Phil Eckert, was a prot�g� of Barry Goldwater, whom many people expected
                    to be our next President. Phil's position was therefore very strong and the
                    Office of the Agricultural Attach� enjoyed a high degree of independence in the
                    embassy. Our State Department was, of course, right in giving priority to
                    America's political aims over those of certain economic interests. At times,
                    however, their attitude was too indulgent vis a vis European or German farm
                    interests. It bordered on the ridiculous. When I once told the head of the
                    Embassy's economic section that we should ask the German Government to
                    liberalize canned fruits, which were still subject to quotas, he told me that I
                    have no political sense. He said that such a request would be very embarrassing
                    to the German Government. Didn't I know that it could weaken its political
                    strength; that we must avoid everything that could have such an effect? The
                    following day it became known that two high American officials would visit Bonn
                    in order to solicit a German contribution to the maintenance costs of U.S.
                    troops in Germany. Fearing possibly excessive American requests and wishing to
                    mitigate them in advance, the German government announced several trade
                    concessions favoring American exports even before the talks had taken place.
                    Among them was the liberalization of canned fruits and vegetables—and western
                    civilization did not break down.</p>
                <p>Before 1962, the U.S. Government exercised ever stronger pressure on Germany to
                    adhere to a common agricultural policy. The U.S. told them that without such a
                    policy, the common market will not advance. Hence there will be no European
                    integration and no unified Europe. The Germans will be guilty of the
                    disintegration of Europe, and the whole blame for this failure will fall on
                    them. Under this pressure the Germans agreed finally on the principles of a
                    common agricultural market.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your German friends, the head of the farmers
                        organization and their allies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: They had to accept it, but they extracted considerable concessions from
                    their government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they fairly satisfied with what they got?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: They were unhappy because they were obliged to lower their prices a bit,
                    though the French had to raise theirs. All in all, the common agricultural
                    market was based on very high common prices.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thus the Germans demanded the highest common
                        denominator.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: Yes, but it was only in 1968 that the support and minimum import prices
                    were truly unified.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: High domestic prices entailed also high import
                        protection.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: Indeed. In a certain sense we were paying for the creation of the common
                    agricultural market. To the extent that the common agricultural policy
                    stimulated internal production, its self-sufficiency increased. Our outlets
                    declined not only inside the common market but also in third countries because
                    higher output led to increasing and necessarily subsidized exports. Thus they
                    agreed on the largest common denominator—i.e. on the highest possible domestic
                    prices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When were these prices finally applied?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: It took another six years, until 1968, before the prices were really
                    unified.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But high domestic prices entailed also high import
                        protection.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: Indeed. So in a certain sense we were paying for the creation of the
                    common agricultural policy. But not only this. To the extent that the Common
                    Market increased its production under the impact of high prices, its self
                    sufficiency increased. After a couple of years they produced exportable
                    surpluses to an increasing extent. Since they could not well compete on the
                    world market owing to their high prices, they subsidized their exports to the
                    detriment of the United States and other third countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I should also mention the so-called “chicken war.” America was exporting broilers
                    and other chicken products to Germany. Exports were growing. U.S. poultry
                    products found a rapidly growing market outlet in Germany, also because the
                    price of American poultry was much lower than that of German or Dutch products.
                    When the EEC began to implement the common agricultural policy, German
                    impediments to the importation of U.S. poultry products were growing. The U.S.
                    protested frequently and vehemently against these German, i.e. common market,
                    import measures. American poultry exporters had strong political backing at
                    home. Thus the so-called chicken war was elevated to a high political level.
                    Finally President Kennedy approached Chancellor Adenauer in this matter. In
                    spite of all the many American efforts to lower the common market import
                    barriers, they became more and more restrictive. Our poultry exports began to
                    fall. The U.S. finally brought the matter before the GATT which agreed that the
                    common market countries owe compensation to the U.S. This compensation assumed
                    the form of increased U.S. import duties on a number of EEC export products.</p>
                <p>Thereafter, the chicken war lingered on for many years. It had many hysterical
                    and hilarious aspects. One of them touched food legislation about which I will
                    speak later on because it goes beyond the “chicken war.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: In 1964. I was transferred to the U.S. Mission to the European Economic
                    Communities in Brussels. I was first Assistant Agricultural Attach� and then
                    Agricultural Attach�. At about that time, the EC Commission in Brussels began to
                    apply the first market regulations for various agricultural products, first for
                    fruits and vegetables, then for rice and then for pork. In the course of the
                    following years over 90 percent of the agricultural commodities produced in the
                    six common market countries were subjected to detailed and strict market
                    regulations. These were accompanied by numerous implementing regulations. At
                    that time English was not one of the official languages of the EEC. I therefore
                    translated many of the important laws and regulations. Almost all of them aimed
                    at assuring domestic producer prices exceeding world market prices; protected
                    them by restrictive import devices that consisted largely of non-tariff measures
                    and provided for market intervention and export subsidies. It was difficult to
                    keep abreast of this legal labyrinth and required close contacts with Commission
                    and Member states officials, diplomats of third country Missions and embassies,
                    and also with trade organizations which out of self-interest followed closely
                    the never ending flow of laws, and endeavored to understand all its intricate
                    details and all its many loopholes. The common agricultural policy was so
                    intricate because it was the result of heavy bargaining. Any concession made to
                    one member country had to be often repaid by concessions to other member states.
                    The loopholes in this legislation led to widespread fraud amounting to hundred
                    millions of dollars. For instance, export subsidies were paid when, in reality,
                    the export in question was merely from one to another member state; import
                    levies were sometimes evaded.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>The progressive expansion of the common agricultural policy led to trade
                    conflicts between the Community and most third countries. However, none of the
                    latter had as big and as variegated an agriculture as the United States. Hence
                    there were constant frictions followed by protests and the exchange of notes
                    between us and the EEC. I believe at the end of my stay in Brussels, there were
                    few U.S. farm products which were not unfavorably affected by the common
                    agricultural policy.</p>
                <p>The work in Brussels became further complicated, when the EEC concluded a number
                    of so-called Association Agreements with third countries, such as Israel, Spain
                    and the Maghreb countries. These were, in fact, preferential agreements in favor
                    of these countries, but initially they affected our trade interests to a minor
                    degree like the so-called Yaounde Agreement which gave trade preferences to the
                    former colonies of the European countries which participated in the common
                    market.</p>
                <p>In the years 1965-67 the Kennedy Round of trade negotiations took place in
                    Geneva. These negotiations affected strongly trade relations between the EEC and
                    the United States. The U.S. Mission in Brussels was actively involved in these
                    negotiations, and Mission officers traveled frequently to Geneva in order to
                    assist our negotiators. I, too, spent a considerable time in the agricultural
                    groups of these negotiations. The agricultural negotiations in the Kennedy Round
                    were difficult and protracted because the EEC feared that concessions to third
                    countries would unravel the painfully achieved construction of the common
                    agricultural policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the outcome of the Kennedy Round?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: The Kennedy Round brought no solution to the many trade problems that had
                    been created by the Community's agricultural policy. They remained unsolved. An
                    International Commodity Agreement for Wheat was—so to say—imposed on American
                    agriculture contrary to the judgement of our experts. Its price provisions were
                    quite unrealistic, and it broke down a few weeks after it had come into
                    force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the so-called “monetary compensatory
                        amounts?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>KOENIG: Brussels was not a place where one could remain idle. The common market
                    was very dynamic, and every so often new issues arose. For instance, originally
                    the system of uniform prices was based on stable exchange rate. As soon as these
                    began to diverge, and this was—I believe—for the first time in the summer of
                    1969, the common price system threatened to break down. It was, so to speak,
                    repaired by superimposing on it a system of so-called “monetary compensatory
                    amounts.” These were additions or subtractions to the common prices expressed in
                    local currency which were supposed to have the effect of restoring the
                    purchasing power of the common prices to what they had been before the exchange
                    rates started to fluctuate. This system was often modified. It became so complex
                    that only a few experts in the Commission and in the member states understood it
                    and were able to manage it. It probably introduced considerable arbitrariness in
                    the EEC's agricultural system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened when the EEC was enlarged?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: At the end of the sixties, the U.K., Denmark and Ireland joined the EEC.
                    They accepted the system of common farm prices to which they gradually adjusted
                    in the course of a transition period. This transitional system brought new
                    complexities in our dealings with the EEC and in their dealings with each other.
                    The increase in protection in these countries, the implicit preferences which
                    they granted henceforth to their new EEC partners and the incentives they gave
                    to increasing production worked all to the further disadvantage of U.S.
                    agriculture. Moreover, the new member states, particularly the U.K., had
                    previously granted important trade concessions to the U.S. The amount of
                    compensation due to the U.S. for the loss of these concessions remained in
                    dispute.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were many debates between us and the EEC regarding
                        soybeans. Can you speak about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: This is an interesting topic. After the U.S. had acquiesced in the system
                    of EEC variable levies on grains and other products, the EEC spokesman pretended
                    that there had been a deal: in exchange for American acquiescence on certain
                    NTB's, they had agreed on zero tariffs for soybeans. This was not true. However,
                    after a while, they found out that their farmers considered soybeans and soymeal
                    to be an excellent substitute for grains, due to the price distorting effects of
                    the variable levy system. Imports of soybeans and soymeal increased and tended
                    to displace domestic grains. The EEC tried to counteract this by playing with
                    the idea of imposing an internal tax on soy products. This was so strongly
                    resisted by the U.S. that the EEC desisted from this idea. Later on, however,
                    the EEC encouraged the domestic production of soybeans and of other oilseeds,
                    whose output increased greatly. The agricultural relations between the United
                    States and the EEC were ripe for a major collision or, in order to avoid it, for
                    a major negotiation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned before problems arising from food
                        legislation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: While in Brussels I was more and more occupied with a problem, which I
                    had already encountered in Germany. The Germans had promulgated a new food law,
                    which diverged from ours in several respects. Already during the chicken war,
                    the Germans had alleged that our poultry was particularly susceptible to
                    salmonella or that we were feeding hormones to chickens. This was pure
                    propaganda, but had nevertheless a certain effect and impacted on the sale of
                    American products in Germany. However, food legislation that influenced sales
                    from third countries became a serious trade issue, when the member states of the
                    Community were obliged to harmonize their own food legislation, in order to
                    avoid that food norms and standards become an obstacle to intra-community trade.
                    All U.S. fresh, dried and canned fruits, citrus, poultry, meat offals, wine and
                    many other products were affected by these measures. There were even threats to
                    stop imports of American grain, unless it was accompanied by a certificate
                    indicating that it was free of DDT residues.</p>
                <p>I was, of course, able to understand and handle all the legal and trade policy
                    aspects of these new developments, but I was not competent to discuss their
                    scientific merits. FAS therefore appointed an ARS scientist as Assistant
                    Agricultural Attach� to the Brussels office, who dealt exclusively with food law
                    problems. The new food legislation did not only cover the wholesomeness or risks
                    entailed by additives and pesticides, but also the labeling of food products and
                    the standard sizes of packaging. The problem of labeling became easier, when
                    English became one of the official languages of the Community.</p>
                <p>I spent a lot of time on food legislation, the more so as many American business
                    representatives visited our office and solicited our assistance in this field.
                    (At that time the Commission did not accept petitions or advice involving food
                    legislation from domestic or foreign industries, but was open to diplomatic
                    representations. Hence, representations by my office (not in the form of
                    protests but as expression of our opinion) became an avenue of approach for U.S.
                    food industries in order to convey their views and ideas to the EEC
                    Commission.)</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the factors which led to a new GATT Round?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: As mentioned before, the frictions in our relations with the EEC became
                    very strong in the late sixties. They made overall trade negotiations desirable.
                    However, there were also other reasons (of a non-agricultural nature), why a new
                    GATT negotiating round was envisaged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did the new round begin?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>KOENIG: It started in 1973, six years after the end of the Kennedy Round. It was
                    called the Tokyo Round. I was appointed to lead the U.S. agricultural team in
                    these negotiations. I was, of course, flattered by this appointment. (I received
                    at the same time the Distinguished Service Award of the U.S. Department of
                    Agriculture.) However, I was also advised by many people not to accept this
                    appointment because I was told that it would not only be burdensome, but also
                    thankless, and I would be subjected to many pressures, intrigues and innuendos.
                    Nevertheless, I accepted but only under condition that I would not only be the
                    leader of the agricultural team in the U.S. Trade Delegation in Geneva, but also
                    Agricultural Attach� at the U.S. Mission in Geneva. I did this because there
                    were strong doubts as to whether Congress would authorize the Administration to
                    enter new trade negotiations. Had these not taken place, I would have been in
                    Geneva without an assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the formal goal of these negotiations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: The agricultural negotiations of the Tokyo Round were expected to deal
                    essentially with liberalization, like any other trade negotiation, but the Tokyo
                    Round also placed special emphasis on the interests of Developing Countries. The
                    EEC, by then the world's largest importer of farm products and one of the
                    world's largest exporter, found this approach unacceptable because its import
                    regime could not be liberal by its very nature. It consisted largely of
                    non-tariff import barriers (essentially variable levies) whose purpose it was to
                    ensure a stable domestic price level. Liberalizing this system would have
                    weakened it, i.e. the basic principle of the common agricultural policy, one of
                    the center pieces of the Common Market.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the EEC behave in view of this dilemma?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: The EEC could not openly avow that liberalization is unacceptable. It
                    therefore tried to interpret “liberalization” as merely meaning the absence of
                    quantitative restrictions. It would have liked to negotiate international
                    commodity agreements with minimum and maximum prices thus consolidating the EEC
                    system at an international level. The EEC justified its approach by asserting
                    that agriculture has special characteristics which call for an approach to
                    negotiating on agricultural products that would be different from the way import
                    barriers on non-agricultural products were being negotiated. The EEC demanded
                    that agriculture be treated in a special Committee and separately from the
                    negotiations about non-agricultural commodities.</p>
                <p>The EEC delegation tried to hide the logical weakness of its position by being
                    very aggressive intimating that the negotiations might break down if its view
                    were not accepted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we counter this attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>KOENIG: I realized that the EEC delegation figured that fear of an early failure
                    of the negotiations would induce the U.S. Delegation to concede the EEC's point
                    of view. I was not of this opinion because I knew that the EEC's industrial
                    groups were keenly interested in keeping the negotiations alive. I retorted to
                    the EEC with equal vigor to show them that they cannot intimidate us. However,
                    my non-agricultural colleagues in the U.S. Delegation urged me to yield and
                    accept at least in part the EEC position. The controversy was overcome by an
                    agreement between the U.S. and the EEC which consisted of a compromise that was
                    acceptable because it was meaningless. I did not ingratiate myself with the
                    non-agricultural members of our delegation, but at least at this point they
                    could not prevail because the instructions from Washington fully supported my
                    view and not theirs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the outcome of these divergencies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: For all practical purposes, the EEC succeeded in having agricultural
                    negotiations separated from the rest of the negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But these were multilateral negotiations and not only
                        negotiations between the U.S. and the EEC.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: Apart from the EEC and the United States other countries such as Canada,
                    Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Brazil and Japan also played an important
                    role in the negotiations. Most of these countries favored true liberalization
                    and freer trade except Japan which played a rather passive role and was
                    primarily concerned with preventing any moves that could open it to larger
                    imports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the approach of Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: Japan tended to support the EEC position, that is, to negotiate
                    international commodity agreements which would not require import
                    liberalization. We and other delegates tried to counter their attitude. We would
                    begin to speculate aloud whether the rice situation on the world markets would
                    not warrant a more thorough study. The Japanese delegation got the hint and
                    moved away from supporting the EEC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the negotiations with the Japanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>KOENIG: They were very frustrating. The Japanese procrastinated. In every
                    bilateral meeting with them, in which we wanted to examine the possibility of
                    Japanese concessions on this or that item, they tried to divert the discussion
                    to unrelated matters. It was only at the very end of the negotiations that they
                    were willing to consider and meet some of our requests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How successful were the proposals for international
                        commodity agreements?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: The EEC would have dearly liked to see an international commodity
                    agreement for grains. They worked very hard in this direction. Other countries
                    were not against such an agreement. However, all such attempts failed because of
                    the staunch opposition of the United States. Yet the EEC succeeded in
                    establishing groups which were to examine the feasibility of world agreements
                    for beef and for dairy products.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How could the U.S. accept international commodity
                        agreements for beef and dairy products?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: The beef agreement was purely consultative without any economic
                    provisions. It was a goodwill gesture towards Argentina. On the other hand, the
                    International Dairy Arrangement was, indeed, a full fledged commodity agreement.
                    At the beginning of the negotiations for a dairy agreement, we treated such an
                    agreement as a mere hypothesis. Later on, we agreed to it with the proviso that
                    no measure required under this arrangement could supersede our domestic laws for
                    dairy. Thus, we were not obliged to observe a minimum export prices, one of the
                    key provisions of this agreement, nor could we be restrained from using export
                    subsidies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude of the other members of the
                        Delegation towards agriculture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: We did not receive the sympathetic support of other members of the US MTN
                    Delegation, which represented industrial and commercial interest groups. They
                    feared that the complexities of agricultural negotiations could lead to crises
                    and even to a complete breakdown of the negotiations. However, they were equally
                    afraid that successful agricultural negotiations would have to be paid for by
                    large U.S. industrial concessions, which they naturally tried to avoid. Thus the
                    defense of U.S. farm interests against foreign and domestic interests proved to
                    be very difficult. The leaders of the MTN Delegation were animated by the same
                    spirit as most delegates: they wished I were not there. Yet I survived because
                    of the support of U.S. farm groups.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>The shortsightedness of those who—to say the least—did not favor U.S. agriculture
                    may be seen from the following examples: at least two major issues of immediate
                    interest to U.S. agriculture were being negotiated without the participation of
                    the U.S. agricultural delegation in the Tokyo Round: a Code concerning
                    agricultural export subsidies and a Code for product norms and standards. As
                    regards the former, some positive results were nevertheless obtained. As regards
                    the latter, my requests for extending the coverage of this Code also to
                    agriculture was obstinately rejected, apparently for petty personal reasons.
                    Agriculture was, in fact, excluded from the Standard Code negotiations. In the
                    following years, the defense of U.S. interests against foreign attempts to use
                    standards and health measures as agricultural trade barriers was hampered
                    because the Standard Code failed to adequately cover agriculture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe the end results of the Tokyo
                        Round?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: The results of the Tokyo Round were by and large satisfactory for U.S.
                    agriculture. It is true, we did not obtain spectacular concessions from foreign
                    countries, but the concessions we made were well balanced. For instance, we did
                    not admit larger cheese imports into the U.S. than before the Tokyo Round, but
                    those allowed to enter the U.S. were under stricter disciplines than before. We
                    did not succeed in dismantling foreign non-tariff trade barriers such as the
                    EEC's levy system, yet there were some substantial tariff concessions, although
                    tariffs were increasingly of lesser importance in view of fluctuating exchange
                    rates. The strengthening of discipline on export subsidies obtained in the Tokyo
                    Round proved to be of no practical use later on. The EEC gained an increasing
                    share of the world market (e.g. for wheat). Complaints in the GATT about EEC
                    export subsidies were of no avail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do when you came back to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: I was named Deputy Assistant Administrator for International Trade, but
                    gradually I was excluded from any work. This seemed to be according to the
                    saying: Knowledge is dangerous. Ignorance is bliss. Finally, however, I was
                    appointed agricultural counselor to the Embassy in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't your assignment to Paris highly satisfactory?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>KOENIG: Indeed, it was, also for professional reasons. Throughout my career in
                    Europe, we had to deal with the French who were the main protagonists of the
                    common agricultural policy and who by the same token saw in America their main
                    competitor and even adversary. At times, they accused us of wishing to destroy
                    the common market. Before my assignment to Paris, I knew many French officials.
                    I knew France quite well and I had participated in panel discussions with French
                    farm leaders before many hundreds of French farmers, when I was still stationed
                    in Brussels. When I came to Paris, the antagonism between French and American
                    agriculture was at a comparatively low point. This was so because at that time
                    political relations between France and America were rather friendly—without
                    rancor which characterized them in other days. Moreover, the French Ministers of
                    agriculture who were in office during that time endeavored to have friendly
                    contacts with America. Rocard, who became Prime Minister later on, had other
                    ambitions than to solve farm problems, and the same was true of his successor
                    Nallet. Also, they were socialists and not primarily interested in supporting
                    the farmers. Their conservative successor, Minister Guillaume, also tried to
                    find a modus vivendi between their and our farm interests. You will perhaps
                    remember that President Mitterrand during his visit to America insisted on
                    visiting our Secretary Block's farm in Illinois. There also existed few major
                    points of controversy between France and the United States at that time. This
                    does not mean that polemics were absent. After a public discussion with
                    representatives of the French Corn Producers Association in Aix-les- Bains, a
                    French paper referred to me as the “able diplomatic representative of American
                    agricultural imperialism at the embassy in Paris.” However, such public debates,
                    of which there were many, were always conducted in a polite and civilized way. I
                    was also invited to give a talk about American farm policy to the Agricultural
                    Committee of the French parliament and a talk about the same topic to the
                    Agricultural Committee of the French Senate. The members of the latter were very
                    sharp and well informed, the former less so.</p>
                <p>During my assignment to Paris the Uruguay Round was underway. Delegations from
                    Washington often visited Paris in order to persuade their French counterparts
                    that agriculture would profit from lower price support and less protection. They
                    did not convince the French.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened after Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KOENIG: In 1987, I returned to FAS. I was not given any assignment whatsoever. I
                    realized that they wanted me to retire. However, I stuck it out for another 3
                    years, in order to increase my retirement annuity. In August of 1990 I
                    retired.</p>
