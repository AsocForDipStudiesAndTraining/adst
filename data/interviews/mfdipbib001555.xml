                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is James S. Pacy, known as Jim Pacy, Professor
                        Emeritus of Political Science at the University of Vermont in Burlington,
                        interviewing Ambassador Maynard Wayne Glitman. We are going to begin by
                        asking Ambassador Glitman about his family, where and when he was born, his
                        education, and so on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: I was born in Chicago, Illinois on December 8, 1933. I have a mother and
                    a father, and a brother and sister (twins). As for something about our home life
                    and family interests, I guess they were normal American interests. My parents
                    did have a strong interest in music and that brought me into contact with
                    classical music fairly early in my life, and it still continues to be a great
                    joy. I had the usual sports activities; I liked ball games, particularly
                    football and baseball with my Dad. The Cubs didn't do any better then than they
                    are doing now. But we still cheered them on. The Bears were pretty good though.
                    I attended public schools in the city of Chicago, Budlong and Hibbard elementary
                    schools and Von Steuben high school. I was on the soccer team, but we didn't
                    have a football team; otherwise, I would have played football. I had a lot of
                    good close friends, mostly involved in outdoor activities, such as hiking, into
                    forest preserves. I developed a great interest for the outdoors early in life.
                    We began skiing when I was quite young, and it was not yet the popular thing to
                    do. My friends and I would often go out after there was a little bit of
                    snowfall; we'd go out, even at night, to the golf courses and do cross country
                    skiing. Eventually we'd go up to Wisconsin and ski a little bit there, but this
                    was in the very early days of skiing. Bindings that we started out with were
                    rubber bands of some sorts around old Swedish skies, and galoshes were all the
                    ski shoes we had, but with that outfit we still managed to go down hill and take
                    little jumps, with no injuries ever. That also continues to be a great pleasure
                    of mine, the skiing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's look at your collegiate education. Why the
                        University of Illinois?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: It had a good reputation for one thing but, of some importance, it was
                    affordable, and I was able to work while I was attending at least while I was in
                    Chicago. I should point out that I began at the University of Illinois Chicago
                    at Navy Pier and then transferred downstate to the Champaign-Urbana campus for
                    junior and senior year. But as long as I was at Navy Pier, I stayed at home. I
                    always had some sort of a job, working in a drugstore, supermarkets, that sort
                    of thing. I also worked during the summers, and then I tried to find some job
                    outdoors. Finally I ran into a person who suggested I try getting a job with the
                    Forest Service. He gave me the name of someone who could help me with that, who
                    knew about that, and I did try to get a job smoke jumping in Montana. They
                    didn't have any openings for that, but they did offer me a job on a project in
                    Colorado dealing with exterminating spruce beetles. I don't know what chemicals
                    I took in at that point, but fortunately I didn't enjoy the spraying and was
                    much happier just carrying the cans of the stuff up the mountainsides. Hopefully
                    I didn't get too much of it in me. I very much enjoyed working with the Forest
                    Service. I was there for two years, the first summer was devoted to this beetle
                    eradication project working out of Eagle, Colorado, and second summer I worked
                    with a trail crew out of Aspen, Colorado. Aspen was still a partial ghost town
                    in those days. Very small population, the ski area had just opened and there was
                    the summer music festival. But that was a very enjoyable job, both of them were.
                    In any case, that's why the University of Illinois.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You received your Bachelor's from Illinois in 1955, you
                        graduated with highest honors and you made Phi Beta Kappa, and I can't help
                        but ask were there any professors at Illinois who were influential regarding
                        your Foreign Service career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: Well, two were particularly helpful, just in general. One was Alden
                    Cutshall at the University of Illinois in Chicago. He taught geography and
                    geology. The other was Dr. Shirley Bill, also at University of Illinois in
                    Chicago. She taught political science. Both of them really inspired me to work
                    hard. I can't explain precisely how that happened, but I guess they both showed
                    me a lot of encouragement, and I could see they had faith in me. They thought I
                    could continue to do well and do even better, so they were inspiring in that
                    regard. I appreciated both of them very much. They are both gone now, sorry to
                    say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, the Masters degree you got in 1956 from the Fletcher
                        School of Law and Diplomacy? Again, are there any influential profs,
                        secondly on classmates who served in U.S. Foreign Service with you, and you
                        did mention some former classmates from Fletcher that you came across in
                        your diplomatic career. Let us hear a little bit about your Fletcher
                        experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: I had heard about the Foreign Service while I was at Illinois. There was
                    a recruiter who came through, and I went with other people to meet with him.
                    That really got me interested in the Foreign Service. So when the time came for
                    graduate school, Fletcher obviously was my premier choice because it was dealing
                    with the issues that I was interested in, foreign policy across the board. I had
                    a very good year at Fletcher; you could get a Masters in one year at that time.
                    I also took one class at Harvard, in geopolitics, with Professor Derwent
                    Whittlesey, the American geopolitician. That also helped give me a view of
                    international affairs, which I think helps, because you get a sense of where our
                    country fits in the world, and of how the world looks to someone depending on
                    where you happen to be. I actually began to use that sort of line of argument
                    with my Soviet colleague when we were negotiating and trying to get them put the
                    other guy's shoe on to see the world from something other than Moscow
                    perspective. It didn't work in many cases but I hope I got through to them a
                    little bit with that approach. Anyway, that was the additional class that I had
                    while I was at Fletcher. As for Fletcher colleagues who went on to Foreign
                    Service, there were several from my class: Tom Boyatt and Herb Levin in
                    particular. I continue to see them. And of course, among the Pakistanis who were
                    at Fletcher, there was my roommate, Ataul Karim, who now is the Bangladeshi
                    Ambassador in Washington, as well as Rafi Ahmad and Mansur Ahmed, both of whom
                    stayed with the Pakistan Foreign Service. Rafi went to the UN and worked as one
                    of the Under Secretaries there. I ran into these fellows throughout my career.
                    We had postings together or would be at conferences together. I enjoyed very
                    much the relationship that I had with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You also did some additional postgraduate studies in
                        Atlantic affairs at the University of California at Berkeley in 1965/66. You
                        had entered the Foreign Service in 1956 and these additional postgraduate
                        studies came up later in your career. Then you served in the Army and I
                        thought you could put this together better in an explanatory style than I
                        can. You were in the Army while in the Foreign Service, so to speak. Could
                        you tell us about this Army duty of yours?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: Right. What happened as you can see took place not too long after I
                    joined the Foreign Service and, I might add, not too long after we got married.
                    We haven't mentioned my wife Christine Amundson (maiden name). We were married
                    in December 1956, and by May 1957 I was in the Army. I did not volunteer for the
                    Army per se, but I had the choice of being drafted or joining a reserve program.
                    The reserve program involved a short time of active duty and a life-time of
                    reserves. I was right off to Fort Knox for my basic training. I complained all
                    the way; I wrote letters home to my bride, who at that point was pregnant,
                    alone, and quite young. We both were, and separation at that point was tough for
                    both of us. While I complained about the Army, mainly I was mostly unhappy about
                    being separated, but in retrospect, separation aside, it was a fine experience.
                    Physical basic training got rid of all the accumulated fat I built up after I
                    left the University and had gone to work. And I never gained it back. Moreover,
                    just the experience of having been in a military organization also was helpful
                    later in life as I spent a lot of my time working with the military. I am proud
                    of the fact that after basic training was over I was given an award as
                    outstanding trainee in the company; the award was a cigarette lighter—and I
                    detest smoking. But I am proud of that accomplishment, for an older guy and
                    someone with the background I had, to do well, it made me feel good. (In
                    retrospect, apart from the separation, the Army experience was a good one).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. 1956-57 you were Economic Officer in the Department
                        of State specializing in international economic affairs. Would you like to
                        make a comment here as to what kind of duties this entailed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: It was quite specialized. I worked in the branch that dealt with
                    exchange rates. This was at time when most countries had fixed rates and the
                    problem was that you often found countries that would be better off if they
                    devalued. But some, out of a sense of pride, tried to keep their currency up and
                    as a consequence their trade balance suffered. I worked on those kinds of
                    issues. Fairly early on I got into the legal side of the questions, and found I
                    really enjoyed that as well. Occasionally I would get papers prepared by the
                    lawyers, and I took great pleasure in finding errors in their papers. Legal
                    errors. Not from the personal standpoint so much as the feeling that I corrected
                    something that might have been wrong. I liked economics, but it was work,
                    whereas the political side, especially the political/military side was almost a
                    hobby. Most of my early work was in the economic area.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>One of the other things I did when I was at that job was during the Lebanese
                    crises in 1958. The Lebanese came to us after it was over and presented us with
                    a request for aid based on the cost of the war to them. My task was to look at
                    their budget and try to figure out how much they had intended to spend before
                    the war and how much they were now claiming that they were intending to spend.
                    That took a fair amount of work, but I was able to point out that there were
                    places where they were requesting things which they had not requested earlier.
                    So we could save a few dollars because we could show these were not expenses
                    incurred as a result of the war, these were the things that they added
                    afterwards. That was also an experience, getting to know how to take another
                    country's budget and work through it. And use that in a way that would help us.
                    Be compassionate but not overpay for something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Afterward, you worked in the International Financial
                        Affairs Office in 1958; then in 1959, you went off as Vice-Consul at the
                        Consulate General in Nassau, in the Bahamas. Could you talk to us about
                        problems in protection US citizens and your major accomplishments personally
                        and whatever else you may wish to comment on, such as supervisors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: We had a relatively small posting in Nassau. We had three officers:
                    consul general; consul; and vice-consul (myself) at this point. Ben Houck was
                    the Consul and at first, Roger Tyler, then Gus Barnard served as Consul
                    Generals. Ben had a very good “bedside manner” with visa applicants, and so I
                    learned a lot from watching him deal with these cases.</p>
                <p>Then there was a lot of protection and welfare. Cruise ships would come every
                    weekend from Florida, and almost it seemed every weekend I would get a phone
                    call on Sunday morning. I would pick up the phone and say, “Yes, Mr. Kemp, what
                    do we have for today?” Mr. Kemp was the undertaker. I am probably exaggerating
                    in my memory, but it seemed there were a number of times when he would call,
                    almost all of these on Sundays. I would have assure that the next of kin were
                    notified, sometimes inventory the effects that had been left, make arrangements
                    for the body to be shipped back. And you had to be careful with the folks when
                    you sort of acted as an intermediary. There were some sad, sad cases, but I
                    won't go into them.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>There were also other problems. Some of these involved American citizens who got
                    into trouble. One example, a somewhat interesting case, was when the police
                    called me and said they were holding some Americans. The problem was that one
                    individual had been caught cashing bad checks. He had hired a ship, a captain, a
                    crew, and a prostitute to accompany him on his voyage to the Bahamas, and when
                    they got to Grand Bahama, he went to the bank and put in a check. The bank
                    looked at this name, checked with his home bank, yes the company had an account
                    etc., gave him the money and he and his crew sailed off, this time heading for
                    Nassau. When they landed at Nassau he tried to do the same thing. Went into the
                    bank with the check, but this time the bank didn't just see whether the company
                    had money, it made sure that he had the right to sign checks. It turned out that
                    he did not. At this point, he was still drunk; I walked into the police station,
                    he was happy as could be and not really aware of what had hit him. The police in
                    effect said that he, as far as they could tell, the captain, the crew, and the
                    prostitute, had made off with whatever money there was, but there was no way
                    that they could prove that. This guy was in trouble. We did our best to see that
                    he was treated fairly under British law, which was our job. They did treat him
                    fairly, but I forget what sentence he got. That was a strange case.</p>
                <p>Another one, which was unusual—and again it seems as if these always happened on
                    weekends. This one was definitely on a weekend. The police called me and said,
                    “You have to come down, we have a murder case.” I drove to the police station,
                    which I should note was next to the Consulate General, and across from the post
                    office and the store where I would get my Saturday and Sunday paper—so I had to
                    drive that same road everyday. I sometimes felt I didn't need to drive, the car
                    could find the way itself. In any case, I showed up outside the police station
                    and I looked up, it had a balcony there and a railing. Hanging over the railing
                    were bloody clothes. That was my introduction to this one.</p>
                <p>I went upstairs, and the police described the circumstances. Two Americans, and
                    again a prostitute they had picked up, had stolen a boat in Miami and had taken
                    it on some voyage to find a tropical island where they could all cavort, or
                    whatever. They ran out of gas and they saw a little island called Cat Cay, I
                    think it was. There was no water on it, but they saw it and landed on it. Later,
                    they noticed a boat on it. It was a fishing boat, American captain, taking some
                    people out fishing in the Bahamas. These guys were on the island at that point.
                    They had gotten to the island, gotten off their boat. Then the fishing boat came
                    into the area and sees them, and they motion to it. One of the guys on shore
                    swims to the fishing boat; he has a pistol with him. The other one is on shore
                    with the prostitute, and he has a rifle. After the guy swims to the boat and
                    gets on board, he pulls his pistol out and the charter boat captain reaches for
                    his shark rifle. Near very close to piracy, more or less, the pirate shot the
                    captain and killed him. He then took the captain's body, the fishermen, and I
                    don't remember if the prostitute stayed with them or not, but they were all
                    deposited on the island, where again there was no water, no food. The two guys
                    who had stolen the boat then took the captain's boat and sped off again.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>What they didn't know was that the fishing boat captain had notified the Coast
                    Guard as soon as he saw the stolen boat at Cat Cay. The Coast Guard was aware
                    that people appeared stranded on Cat Cay. The U.S. Coast Guard handled the
                    search and rescue for the Bahamas. So they did eventually catch these guys and
                    brought them to the Bahamian authorities. That is when I showed up. They had
                    them under lock and key in the jail in Nassau. My job was again to ensure that
                    they got a fair trial under British law. I learned something about the Felony
                    Murder Law. What that came down to was that not only was the guy who pulled the
                    trigger guilty of murder, but his accomplice on shore holding a rifle aiming in
                    the general direction of the boat was equally guilty. It was a felony, a murder
                    was committed, and he was equally guilty. The charter boat's captain's wife
                    came, and we made sure that she got what she wanted, which was a front row seat.
                    She sat there throughout the trial. I went to the trial a few times and again
                    guaranteed that they were treated fairly under British law. And they were. They
                    both were hung. British justice was swift. The captain's widow wanted to be
                    there at the hanging, but the British would not permit that. In any case, it was
                    a sad situation. As Ben Houck, the Consul there, said to me, “This will kick the
                    intellectualism out of you.” The work had impact, and you got to see how life is
                    for a fair number of folks in the world.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: I have another case that was rather interesting. Again, there was a
                    phone call, this time from the psychiatric institute. They had a woman, an
                    American citizen, who was placed there because she was bothering one of the
                    leading merchants. She was convinced that he loved her and that she had been
                    incarcerated at his request. I guess it was that way if I remember correctly, so
                    she said to me that she could “prove her love” for him. My task was to get in
                    touch with her family to see if we could find some way that she could be induced
                    to leave and go home. Eventually I was able to persuade her that the best way
                    would be for her to leave, get a nurse to accompany her, and get back to the
                    U.S. where her family could help her. It was a strange experience in one way,
                    and that is that the doctor had put me in a room with her, and she immediately
                    began asking for scissors. Because she wanted to do some knitting or sewing. A
                    little pause for concern. So we got to experience that, too.</p>

                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: I don't like hot weather for starters, nor does my wife, and that place
                    I refer to as 80-80. Eighty degrees in temperature and 80 percent humidity. It
                    was pretty steady like that. There was a time, and I don't want to knock it
                    because many people go there for holidays, if you like that kind of climate, but
                    there was a period there from about Christmas till about late February when it
                    was just glorious, a beautiful spring, not too hot. We were there at the time
                    when it was really relatively undeveloped. There is a place now known as
                    Paradise Island, across the harbor from Nassau; then it was known as Hog Island.
                    I've seen photographs of it today, filled with enormous resorts. At that time,
                    however, two or three times during our three years, we rented a motorboat and
                    went to the other side of the island—not the side facing Nassau but the side
                    facing the ocean. I am not exaggerating; there were beaches two-three miles long
                    and nobody there but us. But not any longer from what I've seen in the
                    pictures.</p>
                <p>The island was 21 miles long and seven miles wide, and we spent two years without
                    leaving it— and then we went to Miami for a long weekend. I think we were on
                    every paved road and just about every dirt road on it. Lots of little places, a
                    monastery hidden away up in the hills, with wonderful honey they produced,
                    things like that that you find out about. There was a fair amount of
                    socializing. As you can see, I spent a certain amount of time with the police,
                    so occasionally we would be invited to their parties. They were British and
                    wild. I remember on one occasion a rugby game broke out, in the middle of the
                    party. They were good fun.</p>

                        Nassau, we can move on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: I could make a couple more comments about consular work in general. I
                    had issued a fair number of immigrant visas and most of the time I was pleased
                    to do it. There were some interesting cases—this was at the time of the arrival
                    of Castro and some of the people that came out of Cuba during this period had
                    pretty bad reputations. Since they had been with the Cuban police, they had no
                    police records, and there was no way you couldn't give them a visa. Because
                    there was nothing to prove misdeeds other than their reputations. And the law
                    says you can't just go on hearsay, you have to have a proof. On the other hand,
                    there were many wonderful people to whom I gave visas. Intelligent people,
                    people with professional skills, good business managers and so on. I felt we
                    were really gaining a lot from the Cubans that came in at the time.</p>
                <p>But in a more down to earth issue, there was one Haitian who came for an
                    immigrant visa, and he made it; he had all qualifications, and I gave him the
                    visa. He left for the U.S. It was soon after I got to Nassau and he came back
                    after a year and half or two years to thank me and to show me that he had opened
                    his business and was doing well. I was just delighted to know that.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>I did a lot of work for the Commerce Department as well. Sometimes there were
                    people who had swindled American firms, and I was a bill collector in a way; but
                    that was a part of our job. I was glad to be able to do that—especially if we
                    were successful in making their complaint, and getting back the money they were
                    owed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was your sole consular assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: As you can see it was a rather full one. I also had to do the books, we
                    had a local Foreign Service national who did the book keeping, but I had to
                    oversee that, which wasn't fun because you were personally responsible for the
                    errors. I had to do communications decoding in the old fashioned way. Then it
                    was very pain-staking work—you had to get everything just right as there wasn't
                    any fancy machinery. Changing the locks on the safe was another task that I had.
                    In a small post, you do just about everything at least once.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then we move on to you becoming Economic Officer in

                        policy issues for years 1961-1965. While in Ottawa, Ambassador Glitman
                        served under Ambassador Livingston T. Merchant and Ambassador William
                        Walton.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: We were there relatively short time with Ambassador and Mrs. Merchant.
                    But they made a very strong impression on us. Very professional people, both of
                    them, very good and nice people. We were there for most of our tour with
                    Ambassador Butterworth and Mrs. Butterworth. I enjoyed him very much. In some
                    ways he was one of the last Victorians. He had great command of the language and
                    a very forceful personality.</p>
                <p>It was an interesting time to be in Canada, and both my and I wife enjoyed it
                    very much. It was a nice place to raise the family. We liked the climate as,
                    unlike the Bahamas, Canada has a really nice winter, and I was able to combine
                    business and pleasure often. When skiing with my Canadian contacts and friends,
                    a fair amount of work got done going up in the chairlift as well.</p>
                <p>There were a number of issues while we were in Ottawa. The U.S. and Canada were
                    constantly having trade disputes, and that's simply a function of the fact that
                    we are each other's largest trading partners. I don't know the exact numbers now
                    but, I am sure they are in the hundreds of billions of dollars a year in annual
                    trade. And if you have that much business you are bound to have problems. And we
                    had many of them, but by and large we worked well together with the Canadians. I
                    felt they were reasonable people and I enjoyed working with them.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>It was a busy post, in part because of these activities but there were two or
                    three specific issues that came up that I found interesting. Perhaps if I look
                    back on what I felt I accomplished there, one would be the Automobile Agreement,
                    in 1965. Canadians were trying to increase their production of automobiles and,
                    as you probably know, at that point the companies were the same and the unions
                    were the same, in the U.S. and Canada. You had the same automobile companies on
                    both sides of the border and same unions on both sides on the border. So that
                    circumstance made a difference in how we could approach this issue. What the
                    Canadians tried to do was work out some sort of subsidization; it was, in
                    effect, a program which would shift production as much as possible to Canada at
                    our expense. There were different opinions about how we should deal with this
                    proposal, but it seemed to me that we ought to take a very firm line. We had
                    countervailing duty law which essentially works to counter the advantages that
                    another country gives to its trade through some form of subsidies. Some of our
                    colleagues in Washington were hesitant to push forward with this approach. I
                    felt that we should use it, not because I wanted to countervail but because I
                    thought we didn't have another solution and needed the leverage a threat to
                    countervail would provide.</p>
                <p>And in October of 1963, as I recall, I had an opportunity, at a cocktail party,
                    to talk to Ed Ritchie, a Canadian Foreign Service Officer, and a very able man.
                    During our discussion of this issue and how to deal with it, I asked him whether
                    it would be possible to work out some sort of a free trade agreement in order to
                    deal with this. He and I discussed it at some length, and I came away persuaded
                    that if we worked it right, were patient, kept the threat of countervailing duty
                    there, as an element in it of course, but placed the emphasis on trying to work
                    out an agreement whereby we would essentially get close to a free trade
                    agreement on automobiles and automobile parts. That process took some years to
                    complete but in 1965 indeed the U.S.-Canada Automobile Agreement was signed into
                    law by President Johnson. It avoided a trade war. I believe that it helped
                    consumers and producers on both sides of the border. And, quite frankly, I had a
                    deeper motive—and that was my feeling and a view that eventually we ought to
                    have a free trade area with Canada. That arrangement had been tried many times
                    and failed, but I thought that the automobile agreement (if it were a success)
                    would help set the stage for such a free trade area.</p>
                <p>I was not in favor of any political union with Canada; I think we and the world
                    are better off if there is an independent Canada. On the trade side and economic
                    side, the amount of activity is so huge that it makes perfect sense to try to
                    reduce the barriers as much as possible.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>So that was one thing that I was able to accomplish while I was there. Another
                    was dealing with a certain amount of economic nationalism on the Canadian side,
                    which took the form of efforts to “buy back Canada,” which was the slogan at the
                    time. It didn't really make much sense to spend money to buy back a plant that
                    was already there and functioning. But it was symbolic or emblematic of certain
                    mindset that had set in. I did try to work against that. I tried to ease it and
                    demonstrate that American investment was helpful to Canada and to the U.S. We
                    ran into difficulties with issues such as Time magazine putting ads in the
                    Canadian edition. Again, the Canadian government was concerned that Canadian
                    magazines were being forced out of business because of the strength of the
                    American magazines, particularly Time magazine and the Readers Digest. That was
                    another issue that I worked on. We made some temporary fixes to the problem, but
                    I notice in the newspapers that it hasn't totally gone away. I can appreciate
                    the Canadians' concern; they want to maintain a magazine industry of their own
                    and not to have everything coming from the U.S. By the same token, they have to
                    try not to discriminate against the American journals.</p>
                <p>And then another issue I got involved in was Quebec. This was at the time of the
                    so-called “quiet revolution” in Quebec when the French Canadians began to sense
                    that they had to move out of their old culture, not the basic culture, but
                    adjust somewhat more to the modern world and get involved in finance and the
                    rest of the modern economy. The Quebec government began by
                    purchasing—nationalizing—Hydro-Quebec. The point that was interesting about that
                    operation was that it was cited as a perfect example of how to do the
                    nationalization of a firm. A bond issue was successfully floated, the bond
                    market approved of this arrangement, and it was accomplished without any
                    punitive actions against the companies. But I found that this was also tied in
                    to some degree with Quebec interest in, if not separation, then more autonomy.
                    And then, I would go to Montreal to talk to its business and financial
                    community. During one of those visits, I was able to get a tip off that the
                    Canadian dollar was likely going to devalue—and it did. Just in talking to the
                    businessman, I could see that was where it was heading.</p>
                <p>It was interesting going into the banks. I met several times with one of the
                    money traders for the bank. The man must have had nerves of steel. He would sit
                    there and talk to me about the future of the market and then he would get
                    interrupted by a phone call and you could hear him, I couldn't hear the other
                    side of the conversation, but he would listen and say how about this how about
                    that and then he would listen to the response, and then would say, “Sell a
                    million at 340.” Just like that. I asked him, “Do you go home at night and think
                    about what you've done?” And he said, “No. Once it's done it's done.” I had to
                    admire that.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>In this connection with Montreal, Fred Rope, a Foreign Service officer who was
                    number two in Consulate General in Montreal, introduced me to Jacques Parizeau,
                    who at that time was a professor at University of Montreal but who had been
                    involved in the takeover of Hydro-Quebec, a friendly takeover. I had two
                    meetings with him and learned an awful lot about where Quebec was heading at
                    least in as so far as people like Parizeau were concerned and where they wanted
                    it to go. It really came down to a sense that if they wanted to protect their
                    culture, they had to make it possible for people to work in important business,
                    in international businesses, and so on. They needed to be able to work in
                    banking and finance, in production, and in companies where they didn't have to
                    give up their French when they got to the office. In other words, the phrase was
                    that you had to “take off” your French language and culture, as if it were an
                    overcoat when you went to work and become Anglicized. Parizeau made the point
                    that you could never really get ahead in some of these companies. Many of the
                    Canadian companies, Sun Life and some of the others, banks, were headquartered
                    in Montreal at that time and have since left. But if you wanted to get ahead in
                    these large companies, you could; however, you had to move into English speaking
                    parts of Canada, and there was no school for their children in French so the
                    children would lose the culture. They just didn't want to see that happen. So
                    they began to figure out ways to try to increase the number of companies in
                    Quebec that would be Francophone owned and operated.</p>
                <p>It was a complicated scheme; it involved using pension funds and so on to buy up
                    facilities like Hydro-Quebec. If not run by the government at least there would
                    be some government tie-in. This was a beginning of what eventually turned into
                    an independence movement. We know that goes on today, it hasn't succeeded yet in
                    wining any of the votes that they have taken on it in referendums. But they
                    don't give up. I'm sympathetic to their concerns about retaining their culture,
                    I think, again, that the world is a richer place for it. I only hope they can do
                    it in a way that doesn't tear Canada apart. It ought to be possible. In any
                    case, it was in the early '60s that the entire movement began, and I was able to
                    report on it to Washington and give a heads-up that “it's coming.” It was
                    interesting work. Those were things that went on, that I did while I was at the
                    embassy. They were full years, and a lot of good work with the Canadians
                    there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Cuban missile crisis, how did that affect your work
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: It taught me something—a little lesson I guess. We had plans to disperse
                    our aircraft in case of an emergency, and some of them would be dispersed to
                    Canada—to Canadian fields. If you look at the map, at the globe, you could see
                    that a lot of activity was likely going to occur over Canada anyway, if the
                    Soviets decided to head our way. So they were involved with this. But what
                    happened was that when the crisis broke out, the Canadian Foreign Minister,
                    Howard Green, I think he was from British Columbia, became quite agitated and
                    concerned that if American planes were dispersed to Canada, this would somehow
                    be seen as a provocation and create a war and Canada would end up in it itself.
                    The lesson I took away was you really have to be concerned about people reacting
                    that way and set up arrangements in such a manner that it becomes automatic and
                    it isn't seen as a provocation. For example, you need to exercise those
                    operations frequently. If you know you are going to disperse there, exercise
                    that operation. Don't do it just when there is a crisis, do it so that it is
                    routine. Because if you don't have it set up that way then someone is going to
                    say, “You are creating a provocation. You are going to trigger something we want
                    to avoid.” I don't know, but I think, in the end, something was worked out.
                    Still that was the lesson I took from that experience. I was able to apply it a
                    couple of times later in my work.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: No. President Kennedy was assassinated while I was in Ottawa and like
                    most Americans, I can remember exactly where I was and who I was with at that
                    very moment.</p>

                <p>GLITMAN: I didn't have much to see or do with that. If they were there, I don't
                    recall any visits. Later in life I got to see a lot of them, but not at this
                    point.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about activity amidst the diplomatic corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: There was a fair amount of it. We were young, in our early '30s at that
                    point. Chris and I did get around a lot. We lived in a small house, but she was
                    able to make it work, and we would often have people over. Sometimes after
                    cocktail parties, we would just gather up a group of people and pick up some
                    spaghetti or something and come over to the house and she'd get things set up in
                    no time. So we'd entertain that way. There were a lot of parties and usual
                    diplomatic back and forth. I have to make it clear, they are not all fun; most
                    of it is work. I gave a couple of examples already about cocktail parties and
                    agreements coming out of them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Generally your wife and all, were your children of school
                        age then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: My two boys went to school there and our eldest daughter was born there,
                    on this tour. We remembered how much snow accumulated in Ottawa and began to
                    think, as we reminisced about this, that we were probably exaggerating. We went
                    back to Ottawa, took our daughter who was born there and her daughters. We went
                    back so she could see the house where we were living when she was born. It was
                    in the winter, and we were not exaggerating. There were huge piles of snow
                    outside everyone's driveway. It was a long way to school and again we thought we
                    exaggerated how far our kindergartner and first-grader had to walk from the
                    house to the school. But it was a long walk. And they made it longer by climbing
                    up every snow pile on the way home. It was a nice place to live. I had good
                    Canadian friends there. We would go fishing together, sometimes we'd do a bit of
                    business, but that would take place when driving to and from the stream. Some of
                    them were kind enough to show me good fishing holes in the area. There would be
                    skiing, the same thing. I would occasionally work it out so instead of just
                    going to lunch with somebody, I'd pick them up, we'd both go across the river to
                    Gatineau and ski for the afternoon. Of course, there is a plenty of time for
                    talk on the chair lift. We had, as I said, a lot of good opportunities and fun
                    together with the Canadians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about travel beyond Ontario and Quebec?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: No, we didn't really. We did circumnavigate Lake Superior on one of our
                    summer vacations, and that was good fun. And then going into Quebec was easy
                    because it was just across the river. As I mentioned we skied there. We learned
                    fairly interesting things about different cultures. There were two ski resorts,
                    Camp Fortune, which one Japanese colleague referred to as Camp Misfortune. I
                    forget the name of the other resort, but it had an English name. The funny thing
                    was that Camp Fortune had fairly large French Canadian clientele and the other
                    resort was almost all Anglophone. So when you got to Camp Fortune, I noticed—and
                    it took me a while to figure out what was going on—a curious process. At the
                    other resort, there were lines. Everybody got in line and queued up. But at Camp
                    Fortune there was the phenomena we later saw in the Alps; there were what I
                    refer to now as “French lines.” These are triangles, the apex of which is at the
                    entry point. So I learned a lot from the French Canadian kids on how to beat the
                    system. Because if you look at the shape of this triangle, you do not want to
                    enter the line at the back. You want to go off to the side and that's what those
                    kids were doing. So I watched them a bit and I said, “Wow, okay.” I got in
                    there, and it worked out fine. But when I went to the Anglophone resort, I
                    joined the queue, which I preferred. But we found that same phenomena in Europe.
                    These are good natured lines, these “French lines.” You can find some cultures
                    where this becomes a very serious issue. But with them it's just a joke, if you
                    get ahead, you get ahead. If not, well, you take your time. Just a small little
                    thing that popped up there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any comment on Ambassador Butterworth?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: Yes. As I said, he was probably one of the last Victorians. He had
                    wonderful command of the language. One thing that sticks with me is his reaction
                    to a message that we got from the Department of State. This was before one of
                    the Canadian elections, and we had been putting together a series of messages,
                    for example, what were the issues and how the elections were likely to affect
                    the U.S., how was it likely to turn out and how that circumstance would affect
                    us, and what might the U.S. be doing in preparation for this. I had written a
                    certain number of these analyses with my colleagues in the political section. A
                    telegram came from Washington and it effectively said, “There is going to be an
                    election up there, how about you guys sending us some information about it. We'd
                    like to know what's going on.” Butterworth was furious when he saw this and he
                    called me and said “I want you to compile for me a list of all the telegrams
                    that we have sent in...” (Including our airgrams which we had in those days as
                    well as telegrams) “...on this election, a little bit of what the subject is,
                    and get back to me as quickly as you can.” I went back and went through all the
                    reporting/analysis we had done, brought it in to him, and he said, “Umm, okay,
                    thank you.” Next thing I saw was a telegram from him back to Washington.
                    Essentially it said something like this, we have been sending back messages on
                    this election and so on and so forth, and then he said, “The Department, like
                    Aunt Sally, having gotten a glimpse of the obvious, now proposes to have us tell
                    it about this election. Well, we already have, and here are the cables. Why
                    doesn't Washington read these?” “Department, like Aunt Sally, having gotten the
                    glimpse of the obvious.” Wonderful. That was kind of funny approach he had. I
                    enjoyed him very much.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, in 1965 you move on to the academic area, University
                        of California, Berkeley. Would you tell us about that experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: Yes. I had hoped to actually go to work in Europe, but instead I had to
                    go out to California. I was assigned to Berkeley to learn about it. It was fine,
                    it was a good experience. This was right after the free speech movement and just
                    before Vietnam heated up. I really had an opportunity to spend a year at a
                    University with the generation of the '60s. And that was an eye opener. Three
                    are some scenes in my minds eye: student pulls up in a Triumph convertible
                    outside of the bank across the street from the main entry to the campus, dressed
                    in rags, but in this brand new sports car, goes into the bank—I think probably
                    to cash papa's check—and then he goes out and complains about the horrors of
                    society afterwards. But I got to know a lot about these guys. And they were
                    basically decent human beings, but it was a different generation. I took a
                    course in Judo, with the freshmen, and one of them said to me one day, his name
                    was Meek, and he was my Judo partner, bigger and stronger then me, beat up on me
                    regularly, but I liked him, as it was part of the sport. He said to me, “You
                    dress kind of peculiar.” And I said, “What do you mean?” He said—and it was
                    true—”You wear blue jeans, but then you got a jacket and a shirt and a tie on.”
                    I said, “That's my town and country outfit. But I am flattered that you think
                    that I dress peculiarly.” His usual outfit was t-shirt, shorts, and flip-flops.
                    It was kind of fun, being with that generation.</p>
                <p>We had some good teachers. Ernst Hass did international relations, and I spent
                    time with him. He was my advisor and had lectures on history from a Marxist
                    perspective. That also was useful later in life when I had to deal directly with
                    Marxists. It was a good year off. There were several Foreign Service Officers
                    out there, a group of us, including Ernest Johnston and Ed Dillery.</p>
                <p>Ed and I used to play squash and handball together. I think it was handball at
                    that point. There was also Tom Hall from USAID and another guy named Felix
                    Bloch.</p>

                <p>GLITMAN: He was there. Very unusual person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know him fairly well?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: He was kind of stand-offish. I'll do this account of him for the record.
                    Often we'd have get togethers, play football, but he wouldn't do that very
                    often. We'd do it with our families, grown ups and kids, just throwing the ball
                    around. We made it a point to go out together, every so often, to different
                    restaurants. Ernest Johnston took us to a Japanese country restaurant in San
                    Francisco, and we learned about that. Anyway, as we were getting ready to leave
                    at the end of the academic year, we decided that we would get together and go to
                    the Top of the Mark and watch the sun set, which was a traditional thing to do.
                    Everyone agreed but Felix. He just didn't want to go with us. So the rest of us
                    went over, and we went to the Top of the Mark, and we were having our drinks,
                    looking around. And who's over there with his wife? Felix. He knew that we were
                    going to be there! I don't know. I wasn't totally surprised. He was an unusual
                    guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1966 you're Senior Economic Officer in the Office of
                        Canadian Affairs in the Department of State, as International Relations
                        Officer. Now, talk to us about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: I am not sure what “International Relations Officer” was supposed to
                    mean in that respect. But the other parts were correct. This is another personal
                    story. I had hoped that we would get an overseas assignment after Berkeley. If
                    you had been keeping score, you will see that in 13 years we have
                    circumnavigated Northern America, but we have never been overseas. Canada and
                    the Bahamas don't quite make it. We had both hoped to go abroad, and I was told
                    that I was in line for an assignment at Embassy Paris in the political section
                    working on political-military affairs. Boy, I was really interested in that; it
                    would have been wonderful. At the last minute, I was faced with a choice. I
                    could go to Paris, but I would have to do international finance, working with
                    the Treasury Attach�. Or I could go back to Washington and work on the NATO
                    desk. And being a puritan, I chose to go back to Washington and work on the NATO
                    desk, rather than to go to Paris because I really was interested in that
                    subject.</p>
                <p>So we were driving across country, and when I got to Washington I went into the
                    Department and I went to the NATO desk. They said, “go see the European Bureau
                    personnel officer.” I knew something had gone wrong. I went over there, and
                    simple enough, the assignment had been broken.</p>
                <p>Rufus Smith, who had been the head of the Political Section in Ottawa and later
                    became the DCM, had become the Country Director for Canadian Affairs, a new
                    position, and he heard that I wasn't going to Paris. He then insisted that I be
                    assigned to work on economic affairs on Canada, under him. So my assignment to
                    Paris didn't happen and I didn't get to work on NATO affairs, but I ended up
                    back doing economic on Canadian issues. Which, again, still interests me.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>A word about Rufus Smith. He was one of the best officers I ever met. And he
                    ought to, ought to, in any rational system, he would have been Ambassador to
                    Canada. But it didn't happen. His contacts were so good and the Canadians had so
                    much confidence in him, that on one occasion, he was asked to come back to
                    Ottawa and participate in a cabinet meeting, because they couldn't remember what
                    had been said and done at that time. And yet, he ended up as a Country Director
                    for Canada. I told you I was going to tell you a country director story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, so is this the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: Yes. Rufus Smith, this is in his honor. We used to have a Canadian desk
                    and various desk for different countries. But about this time, the management at
                    the State Department decided that they really should have the person who works
                    on the country be seen as the principle point of contact, almost to being like
                    an ambassador to that country, but located in Washington. And they came up with
                    the title Country Director. Rufus, I think was DCM in Panama at that point, but
                    he was sent back to Washington to do that job. So let's see if I can remember
                    that song.</p>
                <p>[singing]”I wanna be a country director, My ambitions really reached the skies. I
                    wanna be a country director, and take charge of all the other guys. I wanna be a
                    country director, my ambition is plain enough to see. I wanna be a country
                    director, and make some high foreign policy.”</p>
                <p>“Make me a county director, let me really strut my stuff. Make me a county
                    director, you'll see I'm just a diamond in the rough. Ask me all kinds of
                    questions, on matters esoteric and arcane. And you'll see from my obtuse
                    answers, that I'm a pro at this Foreign Service game.”</p>
                <p>“Well, they made me a country director, far above all the bureaucratic flak. Well
                    I know I'll be getting a phone call, from Nicholas de Katzenbach. But there is
                    one thing that's got me worried, that makes me wonder if the things aren't so
                    great. The guy that had this desk before me, was a brand new FSO-8.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else on duties of Senior Economic Officer in the
                        office of Canadian Affairs at State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: It was the same, working on the banks, the Canadians trying to make it
                    difficult for American branches, that kind of stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you every have to dash up to Canada for any reason in
                        this task?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: I don't recall that. I got up there later when I was in trade work and
                    later again when I was in the Pentagon. Once it did happen, and that's this UN
                    thing, the next assignment. Rufus felt badly that he had promised me that I
                    would be able to do some political work. The fact was, and those of us who
                    worked for him agreed, that he did it better than any of us could anyway, so he
                    didn't give me any of those things to work on. He called me in late summer of
                    1967 and asked me if I would be interested in going to the UN as an advisor to
                    the U.S. delegation to the General Assembly, advisor on European affairs. That
                    was interesting as the only time I'd been in Europe was five days for an OECD
                    conference when I was in Ottawa. What he didn't know was that Chris' family
                    comes from Greenwich, Connecticut, Old Greenwich, and that they had a nice size
                    house, and all five of their children had left home, and we could go move in
                    with them, and I could be a commuter. So I talked to Chris and she said, “Sure,
                    we'll take the kids up there, we'll put them in the school I went to, and find a
                    nursery school for our young daughter, and it will be fine.” I called him the
                    next day and I said, “Yes.” “What??” He didn't think I'd say yes. It worked out
                    fine for us. That's how I got there, and that leads us to the next
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your 1967 posting to the UN General Assembly, as Advisor
                        on European Political Affairs, where you had an opportunity to work with the
                        Permanent Representative to the UN, Arthur J. Goldberg.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: This was a very enjoyable experience. One shouldn't talk about joy; it's
                    work. But if you like your work and you find it interesting—then you can say
                    it's enjoyable. One thing I have to say about most of my time in the Foreign
                    Service: I liked what I was doing. There were some exceptions, and I didn't like
                    some of the administrative practices; but the fascination and the interest and
                    the sense that you could do some useful work for your country, when you're
                    working on substantive matter, overcomes any of the drawbacks.</p>
                <p>The prime issue for that General Assembly was of course the end of the '67
                    Arab-Israeli war and trying to find a solution to that. Everything we did
                    revolved around that issue. I got to deal with other subjects and my contacts
                    were with the European delegations. I had some interesting experiences doing
                    that. Watching the UN, being a part of its activity, it's sort of like a
                    legislature in a way. I was a party whip without a party.</p>
                <p>Let me give you some examples of the things I would run into. On one occasion,
                    this was during the debate on China...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The admission of China?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: Right. It was a procedural vote, but we were desperately trying to keep
                    the mainland Chinese out of the UN and keep Taiwan in. This was an annual battle
                    which, at this point, we were still winning. Each of us would be given
                    assignments in the morning; we would go to our delegation and there would be an
                    instructions guide—essentially, what you were supposed to do for the day. My
                    task was to talk to all of the European delegations and ensure that they were
                    going to vote the right way, that is, as we would like them to vote. I was going
                    on my rounds, and I would stop and talk to different ones. I met with the
                    Norwegian and some others, and then, after while, the Norwegian came up to me
                    and said, “I think you should know that one of the Swedish delegates is
                    following you around and everyone you talk to, he's now talking to, to try to
                    change their mind.” This Norwegian was from the same village as my wife's
                    mother.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really? Isn't that interesting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall the Swedish diplomat's name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: I've forgotten it. I can see his face though. He was doing his job. I
                    was angry about the way he did it, but he was doing his job. I eventually caught
                    up with him and told him, “Now I am going to follow you around.” The vote came
                    out the right way, on that one.</p>
                <p>Then there are some other things that happened. I mentioned my Pakistani friends.
                    One of them was at the UN for this General Assembly. Of course we had a lot of
                    activities, concerning how to handle the political end to the '67 war. Rafi
                    Ahmed was there at that time. He sort of let me in, he sort of said, “You know,
                    all the Arabs, if you are going to talk to them, if you are going to talk to any
                    of these guys, it is Ramadan, it's sundown I'll be down at the lounge getting
                    coffee and some cakes and so on and why don't you come on down and I'll
                    introduce you.” So I did. I did get to meet them, and interesting things would
                    come out of that. On one occasion, they were all going out to lunch. He was a
                    part of this group. There were several countries that had broken relations with
                    us—Algerians and Syrians, for example. And Rafi just swept me up and said, “Come
                    on, come with us.” Off we went for lunch, and I was able to learn a few things
                    from them and give them a few comments on our position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They spoke with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: Sure. That was kind of interesting. It's a cauldron of diplomacy there,
                    at the UN.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good terminology, “cauldron of diplomacy.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: All things were bubbling. I'll tell you a couple other interesting
                    stories there that I thought were kind of curious. One time, on one occasion, a
                    Romanian diplomat at the UN came up to me and he said, “I want to have lunch
                    with you.” I thought, okay, fine. I couldn't imagine what we would discuss, but
                    there could always be something in this “cauldron of diplomacy.” We went out,
                    had lunch, and he started talking about Vietnam. He was mentioning different
                    arrangements that were going on and I was taking all this in—and I didn't have a
                    clue what he was talking about, or who he thought I was, or who he thought I
                    worked for. I won't go into any more detail, except afterwards, I went back and
                    reported to our senior officials, not to Ambassador Goldberg, but to some other
                    guys about this conversation. One of them turned on me in a fury, “How did you
                    find out about that?” And I said, “Look, let me try again. I didn't ask this guy
                    for lunch, I didn't raise this issue, he obviously had me confused with somebody
                    else.” And he said, “Write it up and forget you ever saw it or thought about
                    it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you meet this Romanian again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: No, I am sure that he figured out that I wasn't the person that he
                    really ought to have talked to. But it was kind of amusing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some closing comments on your work with the UN General
                        Assembly. Perhaps you would like to say a word or two on the diplomatic
                        scene in the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: I would. There is one other topic I wanted to discuss as well, which is
                    my work on the Non-proliferation Treaty. That issue was also being discussed at
                    the UN at that time, and it was my introduction to arms control. Here again, I
                    had my contacts with a number of the other delegations, including my Pakistani
                    friends, and one of the issues involved in the NPT was whether there would be
                    review conferences. The other countries, non-nuclear countries, were anxious not
                    only to have a treaty, but to have an opportunity to review it every so often. I
                    began working on that issue along with Rafi Ahmed. We both were able to come up
                    together with some suggestions on how review conferences might be held, what the
                    terms of reference would be, and the frequency of the review; it ended up being
                    once every five years. That eventually was in the treaty. I don't want to claim
                    that I put it in there, but at least I had a chance to see how arms control
                    negotiations work and got a feel for it.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>The social life was quite active, but as you know, the social life is really work
                    in another form. So there were lots of receptions every night, usually more
                    junior people like myself would be assigned to go along with a senator or a
                    congressman that we had with us at that time. At every UN General Assembly
                    session, there are either two senators or two congressmen. They switch off, the
                    two branches, every year. They become part of the delegation. And it was very
                    helpful. Anyway, we would often be assigned to go with them to a reception and
                    help them along, take notes on their conversations so they could report
                    back.</p>
                <p>Here is what a typical day is, or what it was for me anyway. I'd get up early
                    enough to catch the eight o'clock New Haven commuter train from Old Greenwich
                    station to Grand Central. Then I could walk to the U.S. Mission to the UN. That
                    was a nice way to start the morning. I'd pick up the New York Times and by the
                    time I got to New York I had read the paper. We would start every day with a
                    staff meeting. Everybody would show up and Ambassador Goldberg and the other
                    senior staff would lay out what the activities were for that day and what we
                    should be concentrating on. We'd get our assignments.</p>
                <p>Then we'd go to the UN building and, if there were committees meeting, we'd go to
                    those; or if there was General Assembly activity, we'd go to that. We'd keep
                    quite busy during the day. Almost always there was a working lunch of some sort.
                    If you went over there, you would find another delegate with whom to have lunch,
                    and could continue the business that way. After lunch, we'd come back to the
                    U.S. mission and, at that point, we would have to write up all of the events of
                    the morning and the lunch, get them ready to send to Washington. In the
                    afternoon, once again back across the street to the UN building, participate in
                    either G8 or Assembly activity, or various committee activities. But you weren't
                    done yet.</p>
                <p>After that part of the day was over there were always receptions or dinners.
                    Those would go on till 7:30 p.m. or 8 o'clock. At that point we still weren't
                    done. We had to come back to the mission from wherever the reception or the
                    cocktail party was and write up the events, what had happened at these so-called
                    “social events,” and get those reports off to Washington if they were of
                    importance. The net result was that I averaged getting home by 9:30 p.m. The
                    children were already asleep by that point and, when I left in the morning to
                    catch the train, they hadn't awakened. So I could go several days without seeing
                    them. That wasn't so good.</p>
                <p>But the work was interesting. At first, taking that train back at night, I would
                    take serious things, Economist or some serious magazine like that to read, but
                    as time went by, I found that I was just too tired to do that; so the quality of
                    the materials that I read slipped and slipped until I eventually stopped trying
                    to read anything and tried to catch a little sleep and relaxation till I got
                    back to Greenwich.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave the UN, anything else?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: A couple of things—one in particular. I had a very strange experience. I
                    was invited to lunch by one of the Czech delegates and went with him to some
                    restaurant not far from the UN building. It wasn't so much what we talked about,
                    but it was what was happening around us. And that was that an attractive
                    waitress shows up, and he seemed to know her a little bit. She was paying, shall
                    we say, special attention to me. Frankly, I got kind of suspicious as to what
                    was going on here. We had our lunch, and I went back and reported this. It
                    turned out that he was indeed one of the intelligence officers on the Czech
                    delegation. I'll never know what the truth of that one is.</p>
                <p>I guess I should tell a little story about myself because I have sort of a
                    mischievous bent on occasion. I was asked to meet and greet some visitors, I
                    think they were Danes, who were coming to see Ambassador Goldberg. I picked them
                    up at the lobby and went up in the elevator with them. They began talking in
                    Danish about the meeting that was going to take place. We finally got to the
                    floor where Ambassador Goldberg's office was, the gates opened, and I said to
                    them in my best Norwegian, “Turn left here.” You should have seen the look on
                    their faces. I didn't really know in any depth what they were talking about, but
                    it was kind of fun for the moment. I told them I didn't speak that well. But for
                    a second, they were sort of shocked that someone else might have heard them.</p>
                <p>It was an interesting assignment. I might also say that while most of the time I
                    had to go to these events in the evening alone, there were a couple of occasions
                    when spouses were invited so Chris came down, and we went to dinner together. On
                    one occasion, our Ambassador wasn't able to use some tickets to an opera, and he
                    gave them to me. Chris and I went and invited some Canadians along with us; that
                    was also a very special event. I liked working at the UN. It would have been a
                    good assignment for a longer term, but it didn't work that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, 1968, you were with the National Security Council
                        where you covered international economic issues and Western European
                        affairs. Let's talk about the National Security Council.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: That assignment came out of the blue. The UN General Assembly ended us
                    usual in December, for Christmas. Chris and I and our children went to our home
                    in Vermont, which we had put up in 1967, and spent Christmas there. At that
                    point we didn't have a telephone. One of our neighbors came up and said, “You
                    got a call from the White House.” I said, “Really?” “Yes,” he said, “and they
                    left this number with me.” I said, “Thank you very much.” I took the number and
                    eventually got down to their place and called. It turned out that it was a man
                    named Edward Fried, who had been in the State Department and with whom I had
                    worked when I was on the Canadian desk. He asked me if I would like to come to
                    work for him on the National Security Council, handling international economic
                    issues and Western European affairs. Of course I was delighted to do that. He
                    would have to straighten things out with Rufus, because now you see what
                    happened. Rufus let me go to New York but now I was about not to come back to
                    the Canadian desk but head over to the NSC. I did make one stipulation, and that
                    was that if I had an opportunity to get a good overseas assignment, I would
                    really want to go to do that in the summer. Ed Fried said that was fine with
                    him. On that basis I went to the NSC.</p>
                <p>What's it like working there? Well, it depends on the president. There is one
                    generalization that I think would apply in any case. Let me explain in this way,
                    to give you a sense of what I'm getting at. Soon after I arrived there, I was
                    instructed to prepare a letter for signature by President Johnson, on some sort
                    of gift that he had received from some country's president (I forget which).
                    Simple thing, it was a thank you letter and so on. I prepared the letter, Ed
                    Fried read it and sent it forward; it then went through Ross Dell and the next
                    stop was the President. So there were really two stops between me and the
                    President. In due course, I got a phone call from the President's Secretary, to
                    let me know that the President had signed the letter. I felt very good about
                    that. I went to see Ed Fried and said, “I just wanted to let you know that I got
                    this phone call and the President signed the letter.” Ed Fried is a New Yorker
                    and had a very blunt and brisk way of speaking, he was very smart. He looked at
                    me and said, “You darn well better have your letter signed by the President.
                    He's not your editor. Those letters go in perfect!” And I thought, Oh great! But
                    what it made clear to me was there was no room for error when you work there.
                    Because it was just a couple of stops between me and the President's signature.
                    So don't feel happy when the president signs your letter. That's the
                    routine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask one question, about the location of the
                        National Security Council. Is it in the old Army Navy State building?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: Old EOB, Executive Office Building. Yes. I think at that time there were
                    less than 20 of us, working on the NSC staff. The National Security Advisor had
                    an office in the White House itself, in the west wing and in the basement area.
                    The National Security Advisor was Eugene Rostow at the time, but I am not sure I
                    can remember who the deputy national security advisor was at that point.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>The NSC was divided up not too differently from the State Department in that it
                    was addressing international issues. Ed Fried and I were working on global
                    economic issues, except for foreign aid, and all Western European issues.
                    Someone else was working on the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries, someone
                    else would handle Africa and the Middle East, and so on and so forth. It was
                    pretty much broken down geographically. At that time, as I said, the staff was
                    rather small.</p>
                <p>Our task was largely to keep an eye out for new developments, and my job in
                    particular was to get an inch thick pile of telegrams that came in every morning
                    and go through them to see what issues might eventually come to the president.
                    To sort of keep an eye out for the issues that could find their way to the
                    president, follow those, get in touch with the people on the desks to find out
                    more detail about it if we needed that information. And you acted in a way as a
                    broker, between different agencies and different parts within the Departments,
                    but mainly between different agencies. If there was an issue that came up, we
                    would get memos for the president from the Secretary of Defense, for example,
                    and also from the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Treasury. The object
                    was to see which memo would get to the president and in what form.</p>
                <p>Our job was to take these positions and try to broker a compromise amongst them
                    if a compromise were possible. The object was not to find the compromise; the
                    object was to come up with the best position for the president, as we saw it.
                    But it put us in a very powerful position. We might get a fairly long memo, but
                    what we would have to do was boil that down into a single page. Essentially,
                    “Here are the highlights.” The power of the job was clear. This is particularly
                    true for the National Security Advisor as he can write a little chit on top of
                    what we had done, which in turn was on top of what was coming from these cabinet
                    secretaries. What the president would see first was this note on the top. But it
                    was all done in a very shorthand manner. A lot of thought went into these
                    papers, and we did try very hard to boil these issues down to their essence and
                    not to fuzz them over, but try to make sure that the president clearly
                    understood the issues.</p>
                <p>That changed. Here is another anecdote. After I left that job, and I did have an
                    opportunity as you will see to go to Paris in the summer of 1968, more or less
                    the job that I thought I was going to a couple of years earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me interrupt to inquire, to make sure I understand,
                        the NSC job was strictly in early '68?</hi>

                <p>GLITMAN: Yes, it ended in the summer of '68.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in the summer you took off for Paris?</hi>

                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright. Just checking.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: But let me just, before I go on, make the contrast with after Kissinger
                    got there. This was at time of great stress in the U.S., 1968. There was the
                    assassination of Robert Kennedy, assassination of Martin Luther King. It was a
                    period which I will always remember. Looking out of my window at the EOB, across
                    to the White House lawn, and seeing machine guns being set up. The city was
                    being closed down for fear of riots. And then seeing smoke coming from the
                    distance in the city of Washington as the riots were underway. It was a very
                    worrisome period for the country, but we worked our way through it. The
                    president continued with much of his regular schedule, and there would be, e.g.
                    state visits, such as the visit of the president of Austria came, among others.
                    Of course, as he was a European official, a European chief of state, we got
                    involved; I was involved in helping prepare for these meetings. But there was
                    always a certain air hanging over this as a result of what happened in '68. And
                    of course President Johnson had early in '68 announced that he would not run
                    again. But still we functioned, and it was an interesting experience. I wasn't
                    sure I would actually be able to leave because when the president said that he
                    was not gong to run again, a paper came down that essentially said, “Nobody's
                    leaving till it's over.” But as I mentioned earlier, I really wanted to get
                    overseas if I could. So I was allowed to leave for Paris. But before then, it
                    was busy. There were a lot of international economic issues. Ed Fried was
                    working on those particularly, and he did a superb job on the two-tiered gold
                    system that he helped work out to deal with some of our balance of payment
                    problems.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>After I had left the NSC and went to Embassy Paris, I came back to Washington,
                    for some reason that I now forget, and stopped to see Ernest Johnston who was at
                    Berkeley with us and had taken my job effectively, the economic part of it, at
                    the NSC staff. I went in to see him, and he was sitting in the office I used to
                    have. I stopped and talked to the secretary, Marie. I asked her how things were
                    going and she said, “Oh, Mr. Glitman, this is terrible. They are so busy.” I
                    said, “Well, we were pretty busy before, what do you mean?” She said, “I am
                    typing all the time.” I said, “Typing?” She said, “Yes. You used to do those
                    little chits, but now with Dr. Kissinger, we are writing major papers here. I am
                    just being worn out typing.” I went in to see Ernest and, indeed, things had
                    shifted. What we were doing during the Johnson administration was different, now
                    the NSC was in a way duplicating what the State Department does, getting the
                    whole picture out there. I often felt that Dr. Kissinger, Secretary Kissinger
                    eventually, was showing the career people how an academic can really take over.
                    He had the regular service, full timers, doing all these large tomes. Whereas he
                    did the action things, the bureaucracy was tied up pretty often with writing
                    these papers on this or that part of the world and how it would affect the U.S.
                    But these were almost academic in nature. There is a story, more apocryphal than
                    true that said that he once called in someone and said, “Have you prepared the
                    paper I had asked for?” The person showed it to him, he looked at it very
                    quickly and he said, “No, that's not very good; work it over, do it again.”
                    After a few more days, the person comes back and said, “Here it is again.” He
                    looked at it, “That's not good enough yet, I want it better.” And the third time
                    the fellow comes back and says, “Here is my paper now.” Kissinger looks at it
                    and says, “Is that the best you can do?” And the guys said, “Yes, it is.” And
                    Kissinger then responded, “Well, in that case, I'll read it now.” There was that
                    major difference in the way they operated. I am not sure which approach worked
                    better, but, anyway, it did lead NSC into a much forceful role than beforehand,
                    and that's largely the result of Kissinger's personality and the president's
                    willingness to work with him. He played an important role in that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then we move on to years 1968-1973. Political Officer,

                        control and West European issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: This was a wonderful assignment. As you can see, it lasted for a long
                    time. We really got to understand France, both my wife and I, as a result of
                    living there and working there on those issues. When I came to the Embassy in
                    Paris, we were still dealing with the aftermath of the French withdrawal from
                    the integrated military command structure and NATO's departure from Paris for
                    Brussels. A lot of issues I worked on came as a result of that action. My first
                    thought was to look at these questions and see if there was some way that I
                    could try to help mitigate the negative results of France's pulling out of NATO.
                    I thought that if I had a goal to accomplish something while I was there, it
                    would be to achieve that result—if I could. I began by looking at everything
                    that General de Gaulle had done or said during the period when they were
                    leaving. I found a possibility in his comment that France would be able to
                    participate in some contingency planning with NATO countries, but this would be
                    of a general nature and that they were not going to come back into the
                    integrated command structure. But that phrase, “contingency planning,” struck me
                    as perhaps being a way that we could, if not get back to where we were with
                    France at its full participation, at least have some element of working
                    cooperation. I began to look at ways to see how we could foster that
                    activity.</p>
                <p>Another issue that I got involved in was dealing with the financial consequences,
                    for all of us in NATO, of France's decision to leave the integrated command
                    structure and effectively to tell the U.S. to leave its bases in France. These
                    bases, which were referred to as the “line of communication” stretching from the
                    Channel ports into Germany, were really crucial for us. If you look at the map,
                    you'll see why very quickly. Assuming that an attack comes from the east, we
                    needed to be able to move forces quickly from the ports into Germany. After
                    France withdrew, we still had some possibilities through the Netherlands and
                    Belgium. But most of the material would have to come through Bremerhaven in
                    Germany. Again, if you look at the map, that requirement means that our supplies
                    and reinforcements were going to be heading south, as the potential attack was
                    coming from the east directly across our line of communications. Whereas if our
                    material could come from France, as it was set up to do, potential attackers,
                    the Soviets, would have to go through our forces to get to our line of
                    communication. We had pipelines, which had been put in during the Second World
                    War, some coming from the Brittany and Normandy coast, and some coming from the
                    Mediterranean coast of France. We did work out with the French arrangements for
                    those pipelines, gas and oil, to continue to operate.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>There were problems, but nonetheless that operation continued to function. What
                    we needed to do was pin down in greater detail, how these lines of communication
                    would be kept open. In addition, we also had to continue working with the
                    French, so that if there were an attack, and I had no doubt that France would be
                    on our side, that we could work smoothly together. Again, the contingency
                    planning offered a possibility, but we needed to continue talking with them and
                    making one another aware of how these contingencies would work. The French were
                    not too interested in getting involved in exercises with us. That would have
                    been one way really to prove that we could work together. But in time they
                    became more interested in working with the Germans. Germany was a full-fledged
                    member of NATO, so through that relationship, indirectly, we were able to get
                    some activity together. And I worked very hard and continually tried to foster
                    that arrangement, and in time we were able to work some things out. They are
                    probably still classified, so I am not going to go into them. They are one of
                    the few classified topics that I worked on that that were kept a secret for a
                    good long while. Some of it has come out, but I am not going to be the person
                    who puts any more of it out.</p>
                <p>Another issue was dealing with the financial consequences for us. We had all
                    these bases, they were in France, and some of them were quite useful for other
                    purposes. Some were hospitals, for example, and the French government was
                    essentially saying, “We want these.” The question was do we sell them to France
                    and how do we get paid for them? I got involved in trying to figure out a way to
                    getting the French to agree to pay for the property we were leaving behind. This
                    was one way where I could combine work with pleasure. I wanted to see these
                    bases and see what was being done with them. So we would drive around on the
                    weekends, taking the family. We had a micro-bus at that point; all five
                    children. Our youngest daughter was born in Paris. We'd all hop in this
                    micro-bus, and I would look for baseball back stops. This is how we knew we were
                    getting near a base—you'd see a baseball back stop. At that point, there were no
                    signs that this was formerly an American base. I discovered that some of these
                    hospitals were being used by local French communities. The airfields were also
                    good. Other things came up.</p>
                <p>One story that I heard was that the Air Force had a golf course at one of the
                    bases in Normandy. We vacated the base, the Air Force said these greens were
                    worth something, and that the French, should reimburse us for these. And the
                    French said, “No, no, we are not going to do that.” This may be another one of
                    those apocryphal stories, but in any case it's worth recounting. Apparently, the
                    U.S. Air Force said, “Well, in that case we are rolling up the greens and taking
                    them to another place.” They began to do it and the French said, “Wait, stay
                    right there. The French Air Force will buy this golf course.” If it's not true,
                    it ought to be.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Interesting things came up. When we were trying to figure out the value of some
                    of these properties, we would look at the lighting, for example. Well it turns
                    out we use a lot more lighting than the French do. So their argument was, “You
                    may have three lights in this room, or 3,000 lights in this facility, we only
                    need 1,500, we are not going to pay you the extra amount.” While all this was
                    going on, these details, I got into the international law cases. I looked up one
                    called the Chestushowa Factory Case, and I went into all these arguments about
                    legal aspects of this and so on. We had discussions about these properties and
                    how we evaluated them and so on. It seemed to me that in the end, there was
                    going to be a political deal. We had to come up with a number that would be good
                    for us, good for them, and settle this subject. Eventually, it worked out that
                    the French defense minister was going to visit Washington. So I sent cable and I
                    said this would probably be a good time to make an offer. What we asked for was
                    I think about $100 million. Our initial claim was about $300 million. Well, I am
                    told that for surplus property normally it's nickel for a dollar, and we were
                    going to get about 25-30 cents on the dollar, so we weren't doing too badly. And
                    it opened up a way to a better relationship in general. So we settled that. The
                    foreign minister told our ambassador—and this went into my efficiency
                    report—that my work with this problem had been very important towards a
                    settlement. We got over a hurdle with no bad feelings about what happened to the
                    property.</p>
                <p>And, as I said, there were other things we did that I worked on. Some ideas that
                    I came up with led to very much closer cooperation in terms of planning and
                    working together. It unfortunately still hasn't returned to what it used to be,
                    when they were a full NATO member, but little by little, we learned to work with
                    them. I spent a lot of time when I was at NATO working with the French. I guess
                    I'd have to say I'd always found them very worthy adversaries. You got to watch
                    yourself, they are smart. But you can deal with them; you can work things out
                    with them.</p>
                <p>Let's see, what else about Paris? We had a good embassy, a good group of people
                    there. Many of whom became close friends. Bob Frowick, who I first met when I
                    was in Ottawa; he was in Montreal. He worked next to me in the political
                    section. Allen Holmes was also in the political section. Bob Anderson was the
                    Political Counselor. John Condon was the Labor Attach�. I hadn't mentioned Joe
                    Presel, who later became Ambassador to Uzbekistan. John Condon and Joe Presel
                    were two of the best contact people I ever met. They were just wonderful in
                    getting out and meeting folks, getting useful information, coming back, and
                    reporting. Both became good friends of ours. There was a lot of social activity
                    in Paris. You can imagine, lot of cocktail parties, receptions, dinners,
                    lunches, on and on. We did a lot of entertaining at home.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>We found a wonderful apartment, it was on the Rue de Rivoli and Rue Cambon, which
                    puts it across the street from the Tuileries and was two blocks from the
                    Embassy. The kids had to commute to school, and I walked to work. In those days,
                    before the troubles in Vietnam and so on, we had a side gate into the Embassy,
                    so when it was raining I learned that I could walk under the arcades on the Rue
                    de Rivoli, stay down till the metro but not use the metro, walk underneath the
                    Place de la Concorde and Rue Royale, come up outside the station to Hotel de
                    Crillon, and then walk into the Embassy through the side gate so you would get a
                    little moisture on you but not much.</p>
                <p>That all ended while we were there and when the dangers from Vietnam grew. In
                    fact, I was assigned the task of examining the Embassy to see what we could do
                    to strengthen security. That was an interesting job, because I got into the
                    basement and to the back side of the building, trying to figure out where we
                    would have to put up gates and so on. There was a security officer but, for
                    whatever reason, the ambassador asked me to do this. It began to change. That
                    side door was closed. If you go there—the last time I was there at least—it was
                    a small fortress.</p>
                <p>We had quite a good spirit in the staff there. In fact, everyone was happy to be
                    living in Paris. Almost everyone. I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't be. It was
                    one of the most wonderful times of our life. And the dollar was strong, at least
                    until 1973, when we left. In '71 I think the gold standard ended. It was good
                    strong dollar, the prices were not bad, and we were able to see a lot of the
                    country. We traveled extensively through France. We both got to know it really
                    well. Soon after we got there, without too much effort, we felt at home. You
                    could spend the entire day in French and not feel out of place. It was
                    automatic. It was a good place to be.</p>
                <p>We had two ambassadors while I was there. The first was Sargent Shriver, who I
                    enjoyed very much. He was interested in things. If you sent him a memo, he
                    didn't just read it. He'd write marginal notes and he'd call you in and ask you
                    to explain things, and he was active, encouraging. Some of the issues that I
                    mentioned and that I didn't want to discuss in any detail went through him. I
                    had some difficulties with some of the other folks to get some of the key
                    messages. I got in trouble with one of those guys afterwards, but I had to do
                    it. He was blocking what I knew we needed. Just a presentation of this. And
                    Shriver called me in and he looked at this paper that he had in front of him,
                    which I had written but it wasn't really what I wanted, and he said, “This is
                    too vague,” etc. I said, “Yes sir, it is. How would you like to see a legal
                    version of this, sort of a legal approach?” Shriver was a lawyer and he said,
                    “Yes.” I said, “Just a moment.” I got in trouble for this. I went and I said,
                    “here.” And he said, “yes! That's what I've been waiting for.” That paper had
                    been sitting on somebody else's desk for a month and a half, and he wouldn't let
                    it go. He was really ticked at me afterwards. Not Shriver, but one of my
                    supervisors. Really angry. But, if I had not done that, we would not have gotten
                    this message out and the program that we finally worked out with them, with the
                    French, would not have happened.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>He was always late to events, Shriver. But he couldn't help it. I accompanied him
                    to receptions, and people would surround him. He was a gregarious man, he
                    enjoyed talking with people. He would head for the door, because he had another
                    reception—or two or three a night—and people would grab him. And he couldn't be
                    rude. He was late, but I didn't hold it against him.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Watson was probably one of the most difficult people I've ever met. He
                    was a very hard guy to work with. There are tons of stories I could tell about
                    him, but I am not sure I should, he is gone. Just leave it at that, he was not
                    easy to work with. And mercurial in some ways. I'll mention the one occasion I
                    used the word to describe a situation. Remember I told you about learning from
                    Howard Green about the problems of being seen as provocative and how you should,
                    if you see a situation as one that could become a problem, try to do things on a
                    routine basis so that if you do it in emergency it'll seem normal. And we had a
                    problem. One of the jobs I had was every year and I guess once a month in
                    addition, we put in for over-flight rights. That is for American planes to
                    over-fly France. When they left NATO, we had to go through this drill with them.
                    It was their sovereignty, and they wanted to demonstrate that they would work
                    with us; but we would have to make a presentation and say, these planes will be
                    doing this on that mission.</p>
                <p>I had attended a conference of political/military officers in Stuttgart with U.S.
                    military as well as folks from embassies. They were concerned with over-flight
                    rights in case of trouble in the Middle East. It occurred to me that when I put
                    in these requests, they were usually for various types of flights. But if we
                    thought we were going to have to over-fly with troop transports or something
                    like that, again remembering that lesson about not appearing to provoke, it
                    would be easier for the French to give clearance for a fairly large number if we
                    had established a pattern in advance. We would show that when we did these
                    over-flights and missions, and were going from here to there, we were practicing
                    and exercising. So I suggested that we move in the direction of asking for more
                    over-flights in certain areas. I will say this, and it will give you a feel for
                    why Watson was hard to deal with. I explained this, that this concept came out
                    of this conference, and that I thought we had a way to deal with this issue by
                    every year, every time we put in these requests, putting in a request for this
                    particular type of over-flight. You see what I am getting at? And I said, “If we
                    skew the request in this direction, if there is a problem, it will be much
                    easier for the French to accept, because it had already been accepting that kind
                    of thing in great numbers.” He blew up. He said, “I don't like that word
                    “skewed.” It's not in the dictionary, and I banned it from IBM.” Bob Anderson
                    grabbed me, “I know it's in the dictionary, don't get on with him.” And Watson
                    said some other things which I won't be repeating. That was the end of that. But
                    in fact we did eventually begin to make that move. I could only assume that at
                    some point in the past, someone had used that word at some meeting and he got
                    angry or whatever was the case. I don't know what it was but he just took off.
                    There were other funny stories, but as I said, I won't go into them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Mr. John Irvine?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: He was, if I recollect correctly, Watson's brother-in law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that's interesting. Arthur K. Watson's
                        brother-in-law?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: Yes. John Irvine was a fine man. Calm, thoughtful. He knew his stuff but
                    he did leave the impression sometime that he wasn't sure. But he had it right.
                    You could talk to him, he'd understand it quickly but often I'd get the sense
                    when he asked questions afterwards that he wasn't sure that he had it right, but
                    he did. He was a good man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Watson's career? What was his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: He was a son of the founder of IBM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sorry. I meant Irvine's?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: He was married to Watson's sister. I believe that's the tie-in. He was a
                    lawyer, and had eventually become Deputy Secretary of State, either before or
                    after this. But I liked him. As I said, he was an easy man to work with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about some comment on Corps Diplomatique and life in
                        Paris, just in general? We've learned about this fabulous home of
                        yours...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: The diplomatic corps was large, as you can imagine. There were many
                    events, receptions, and so on. You'd get quite busy with it. They were a good
                    group of people. I can't think of any specific examples and events that stand
                    out particularly. It was just a very busy place with lots of activity. Most of
                    the people assigned there were very good, from all the different countries. Life
                    in Paris? Well, what can I say? It was a wonderful place to live at a wonderful
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have school-aged children? Did they go to school
                        in Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: Yes. The two older boys went to the American School. They were too far
                    along and we felt, maybe wrongly, that they would be better off doing their
                    studies in English rather than going to a French school. But for the three
                    younger ones, we put them in the Ecole Active Bilingue, bilingual school; it was
                    in the Parc Monceau, and you may have seen pictures of wonderful gilded gates.
                    It was a wonderful school. What they did there was to spend the first semester
                    doing history in English and algebra in French or math in French and so on. You
                    would take different subjects in a different language, and then, in the fall,
                    you would switch around. Children very quickly became bilingual. My wife would
                    pick them up at the school, and she would listen to them play with the French
                    children, and back and forth, between English and French, whichever language
                    seemed to best fit the need of the moment to describe something or make a point,
                    they'd switch to that. They were very fluent, all three of them that went there.
                    And they never lost their good French accents.</p>
                <p>Our son, who was our youngest boy, he was able to read Le Monde, at least to
                    pronounce the words, and then the Herald Tribune, but here is an interesting
                    point. When we left Paris, we got on TWA and flew out. My wife and I tried to
                    encourage them to continue to speak French, but he just would not—not even on
                    the airplane. In his mind, he was going back to the U.S. and he was not going to
                    be speaking French. Well, he still speaks it quite well, but he did consciously
                    try to stop. Another thing that happened, in his case, was that he learned to
                    write (the French don't go through printing, they start with script). He had
                    beautiful penmanship and, when we got back to Washington, to Bethesda, they
                    forced him to print. We had his old French books, written out with this
                    wonderful hand. His handwriting is awful now, and the school system would just
                    not make an adjustment for this student. Which is too bad. My handwriting is
                    pretty awful, and his is still far better than mine, but it was, if you could
                    see it, the child of five or six writing so beautifully, and then at eight or
                    nine it looks not quite so good.</p>
                <p>I had mentioned that I was able to walk to work while the kids were going to have
                    to commute. That was true for two older boys, but Chris had to drive the three
                    younger ones to school. Both of us, I am afraid, picked up some bad driving
                    habits, driving around in Paris in particular. We had to make corrections when
                    we came back to the States.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>As you know, when we make a left hand turn, people line up in the left hand turn
                    lane. But in Paris, they don't do that. They line up shoulder to shoulder and
                    the whole side swoops across. It's great fun. That reminds me of a remarkable
                    scene I happened to witness where the Champs Elys�es comes out into the Place de
                    la Concorde. I was able to walk to the Quai d'Orsay, across the bridge from the
                    Embassy. On this occasion I had some business there, but I was walking. You have
                    to try to picture this scene. This is what I saw. Coming down the Champs
                    Elys�es, which is a very wide street, were a number of cars, blocked by some
                    other vehicles that were cutting across the Champs Elys�es, just before they
                    enter the Place de la Concorde. There is a little street there. What happened
                    was that there were buses in effect blocking the view of the people coming down
                    the Champs Elys�es, and blocking the view of what was below that. And those who
                    were coming out of the Place de la Concorde, seeking to go in to the Champs
                    Elys�es, their view was also blocked. What I noted was that there was this line
                    of buses across there that blocked their view. On either side of this line of
                    buses, blocking the view of those coming out of the Champs Elys�es, the drivers
                    had begun to spread out. In other words, instead of staying in the right lane or
                    the left lane on both sides of this traffic, which they could not see, they had
                    spread out to cover the entire Champs Elys�es. So when the buses disappeared,
                    you found lines of cars facing one another. And they had trouble sorting that
                    one out. It was very amusing to see that.</p>
                <p>We talked a little bit about the apartment. I should point out that it was a
                    wonderful place. It took a month of negotiating to get the price to where we
                    could barely afford it. I made sure the contract was settled in dollars, so when
                    French franc devalued we were able to handle that. That worked out fine. There
                    were also some presidential visits, one very important presidential visit. That
                    was the visit of President Nixon, soon after he was inaugurated. Each of us was
                    assigned to a different event, to cover and act as liaison with French
                    officials. And to preview the event and make sure that everything was set up
                    right. I was given the Petite Trianon, a palace where Nixon and President de
                    Gaulle were going to meet. I was able to go there and, in effect, walk through
                    the building and see exactly where they were going to stand and sit. We had to
                    report all that information back to Washington in exquisite detail: President
                    will arrive; he will walk up three flights of steps; turn to the right; go x
                    number of feet; General de Gaulle will be there to greet him; they will then
                    proceed to this room and that room; and so on and so forth. But we got to see
                    the entire inside of the building.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>A couple of interesting things happened during that visit. One was that Dr.
                    Kissinger missed his motorcade, so he arrived late, and was quite unhappy, but
                    we did manage to get him in. We knew the building and we knew exactly where he
                    should be. The other two points were that, while President Nixon and President
                    de Gaulle were meeting alone, the foreign ministers were also supposed to be
                    meeting. But all the key interpreters had gone with the President and that left
                    the need for someone to interpret between the American Secretary of State Rogers
                    and the French Foreign Minister. That task fell to me. I was pretty nervous. The
                    subject was Vietnam. It doesn't matter which way it was, French into English
                    would have been somewhat easier, and I think that's the way it went. But I was
                    not a trained interpreter. Taking notes and so forth. But there I was on the
                    spot. Well, the discussion went on, and there were some very easy short phrases;
                    but then, at one point, one of the participants dove into the matter and began
                    going on at great length. I was falling further and further behind and, as I was
                    about to get almost submerged, to drown in this, somebody came in and said, “The
                    two presidents are ready to receive you now.” So I didn't have to do the
                    translation. That was kind of an amusing escape.</p>
                <p>Another thing I learned when I was in France, and that I later put to use, was
                    the material with which we were working on the political/military side. I dealt
                    with the Quai d'Orsay principally, but after a while I began to go to the
                    Defense Ministry as well and meet with Michel Debr�. He was Defense Minister and
                    he had a foreign service officer, Serge Boisdevaix, from the Quai, working as
                    his diplomatic assistant. So I spent a lot of time with Boisdevaix and was fully
                    in with Minister Debr� as well. What I discovered during this period was that
                    when you are trying to deal with some military problems, there are advantages to
                    trying to keep diplomats out and let the military work with the military. It's a
                    much better way to get things done. Because they get down to the brass tacks.
                    They know exactly what it is that they need, they know how far they can go, and
                    that was something that I found useful later. If you are having trouble dealing
                    with your diplomatic colleagues, see if you can make progress by letting the
                    military do it directly. It did help move these issues along in France, and also
                    later in NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1973 you returned to Department of State, serving as
                        Director of the Office of International Trade Policy and subsequently as
                        Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Trade Policy. In this
                        later capacity you chaired several U.S. delegations to GATT and OECD. Let's
                        talk about these matters now.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: This was a particularly difficult time in a sense that there had been an
                    Arab-Israeli problem again in '73 and the price of oil begun to rise as result
                    of the war. This was one of the consequences of the OPEC raising prices on oil.
                    So a lot of the economic activity was focusing on the energy problems. The trade
                    side had a role to play and it was essentially, as I refer to it, as a “blocking
                    back.” That's how I saw my role at this point. To keep the road open so that we
                    could make progress on the crucial energy problem. The key issue that we were
                    confronting on the trade side was protectionism in the U.S. and elsewhere. There
                    was new trade legislation that was going into affect about the time I came to
                    that job, and I got to see it through to its approval. We were working on
                    another trade round, trying to get that set up. But essentially, this was all an
                    effort to keep the international economic system functioning as smoothly as
                    possible and to avoid a possibility that we would be a part of an effort to
                    raise barriers to trade at a time when we really needed to keep things as open
                    as possible. Much of the work became quite detailed on the specific
                    questions.</p>
                <p>To give you some quick examples: mushrooms. One becomes an expert on mushrooms in
                    this kind of work. And whatever else you deal with. I won't say that you become
                    an expert, but you at least become somewhat knowledgeable about it. And the
                    problem here was imports coming from, I believe, Taiwan and Korea in particular.
                    These were tinned mushrooms, which were cutting into the American mushroom
                    producers' market. One of the problems was that they were being undersold by
                    these imports. But as somebody pointed out to me, if we enjoyed fresh mushrooms
                    in this country, it was because the fresh mushroom industry was functioning;
                    however, if it went under because of the importation of canned mushrooms, we'd
                    have nothing but canned mushrooms. That was somewhat of an incentive to work
                    hard for the mushroom industry. It did involve a lot of discussion with the
                    diplomats, trade people from Taiwan and, I believe, from Korea as well. There
                    were rules and regulations that we had to follow, but, on the other hand, the
                    problems of dumping, that is to say selling exports at a lower price than you
                    would normally buy in an internal market, topics like that, we certainly had
                    grounds for taking them to the GATT. We would do this to ensure that they would
                    follow the GATT rules.</p>
                <p>Other issues, topics that came up, were cheese and dairy products. These were
                    also a problem because of a surplus of such products in many countries. Many
                    countries subsidize their dairy industry very heavily. And again, one learns
                    things about how different industries function. The issue with the dairy
                    industry was butterfat. The object for countries was to get their butterfat out,
                    if not in the form of milk and cheese, then in the form of butter cookies. But
                    the net result of that approach was, if we started getting heavy imports of
                    cookies and other items made from butterfat, it ate into our own domestic dairy
                    industry. Again, we had rules and regulations in GATT which described what was
                    legal and what wasn't. If we thought the other countries were not following the
                    GATT rules, we would, in effect, take them to court.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Sometimes I found that on our side things maybe had gone a little too far. One
                    example had to do with cheese in which some of our people were very zealously
                    arguing that other countries were exporting their cheese to the U.S. and selling
                    it as very cheap cheese. Then the imported cheese would be melted down in the
                    U.S. into something like Velveeta. They began arguing that some of the cheeses
                    that were brought in this way were Emmentaler and Gruy�re, two very expensive
                    Swiss cheeses. It didn't seem to me to make any sense, to export expensive
                    cheeses so that they could be melted down for cheaper cheeses. In any case, one
                    of the items we got into was whether anyone could tell the difference between
                    Emmentaler and Gruy�re. I said that if I could prove to them that I could tell
                    the difference blindfolded would they agree with me that Gruy�re at least did
                    not belong on this list of cheap cheeses that were being dumped in America. So
                    we did do a blind taste test and I did get them right. That's sort of a strange
                    way to make policy, but it did prove the point.</p>
                <p>Another case we got involved with was steel imports from Japan. Again, there was
                    concern that these items were being dumped in the U.S. Once again, our effort
                    was to try to make sure that our industry was properly protected without going
                    beyond the rules and the regulations that we had agreed. I found myself in this
                    job traveling an enormous amount of time. I figured out afterwards that I was
                    gone just about one week of every month. For example, in the case of Japan, I
                    made a very brief trip there during one of the steel issues. I found out about
                    it, determined that I was going to have to go to Tokyo for one day, and 24 hours
                    later I was on a plane and we flew to Japan. We went to meet with the Japanese
                    Foreign Ministry, gave them some bad news, then they took us to lunch, to some
                    restaurant in Tokyo, my first time there, so of course I was interested in
                    everything I was seeing. Then we visited with the Ministry of Trade and
                    Industry, and we gave them some bad news. Then we ran for the plane, in order to
                    be back in Washington before the announcement could be made so that we wouldn't
                    be asked any further questions about it. Washington would handle all this out of
                    Washington. But we wanted to give the Japanese a heads-up by flying there.
                    Travel led to Geneva quite frequently as well. And it was at a time when I
                    really felt that I had seen enough of airplanes. In any case, I believe we did
                    succeed in dealing with the protectionist problem at that time. It was possible
                    then to make some progress on the energy side.</p>
                <p>One thing I introduced during this period was what I refer to as the “graduation
                    concept.” That was result of having seen ads in American newspaper for Brazilian
                    armored infantry vehicles, and I began to think that if Brazil was capable of
                    competing with us in something like building armored cars, military vehicles,
                    not Cadillacs with extra armor but military vehicles, that perhaps time had
                    come, at least in that kind of industry, when Brazil really didn't need the type
                    of assistance that a less developed country might need. That concept of
                    graduation eventually found a way into the U.S. approach to the trade policy; I
                    think it's still there now. It was a fairly full period in my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in this position? You started in 1973.
                        Was it '76 that you...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: Yes, in 1976, it's a fairly long story but, quite briefly, I was told
                    that I would have to move out of the Deputy Assistant Secretary's job because
                    the Department was going to put political appointees into deputy slots in almost
                    all of the Bureaus. Since both Jules Katz who was the principle Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary and Joe Greenwald who was the Assistant Secretary, were both very
                    competent, able guys and trade policy was their forte, they would be able to
                    keep an eye on whoever came into the trade portfolio and handle it, that is, the
                    deputy assistant secretary position in trade. So my job was the one that was
                    going to go. That meant I had to find something else to do. At that juncture I
                    had an opportunity to see George Vest; I explained my situation to him and asked
                    him if he knew of anything that was coming open. And in fact he had, he did, and
                    he said, “You need to get hold of Gene McCauliffe, another Foreign Service
                    Officer who has just become Assistant Secretary at the Pentagon for
                    International Security Affairs, under Rumsfeld. He's looking for somebody.” I
                    said, “Boy, I would really like to do that.” George agreed to give Gene a call
                    and suggested that I call Gene as well; so I did. Both McCauliffe and Rumsfeld
                    had tried to get me to work for them when they were at NATO together. So they
                    knew about me. As soon as I called Gene, he was ready to have me come over. Next
                    thing I knew, I was being called by his military assistants and preparations
                    were underway to transfer me from Deputy Assistant Secretary of State to Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary of Defense. That leads into my next period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, now in 1976 you become Deputy Assistant Secretary of
                        Defense for International Security Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: This was a very interesting job. I liked it very much. It was very
                    active. But I want to begin by drawing some contrast between working in the
                    State Department and working at the Pentagon. One of the trips I took just
                    before I left the Department of State, on the trade side, was to Ottawa. It took
                    me a day of travel to get there, a day to do my business, and another day to get
                    back from Ottawa. Three days were spent on one-day visit. Soon after I went to
                    the Pentagon, I was told that I needed to go up to Ottawa to meet with the
                    Canadians on various issues that we had with them. And it was a one-day trip. An
                    Air Force plane flew me to Ottawa. The airplane stayed there, I did my business
                    and I came back that night. That was quite an eye opener.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>In addition to that, I felt that the atmosphere at the Pentagon was a good deal
                    friendlier. Working in the State Department you have your friends and your
                    colleagues, but there was something about just walking down the corridors in the
                    State Department, which didn't become clear to me until I got to Pentagon, and
                    until years later when I read a letter in the State Department magazine. People
                    said “Hello” in the Pentagon, even if you didn't know them, as if you were in
                    some small town together. There was cheerfulness in the atmosphere. In terms of
                    making your work easy, I just gave one example of how that was done, with the
                    airplane. The State Department doesn't have its own air force, but still the
                    military has that capacity and they used it. There was also this sense of
                    willingness to find solutions, to cooperate, and to resolve problems. I just
                    have trouble regarding to what to attribute this difference. But there was
                    definitely that sense of being in a sort of more friendly community.</p>
                <p>I mentioned, years later there was a letter to the editor of the State magazine.
                    The headline, the title on the letter was “That look away look.” It was a letter
                    from a military officer who had been sent over to the State Department to work.
                    He described walking down the halls at the State Department and he'd see people
                    he knew there, but rather then make eye contact with him, they'd look away. He
                    found that most peculiar. I thought about it and I said, “My Gosh, he's right.
                    It does happen.” I wouldn't say all the time but it did happen there. And that
                    was another contrast. I found out also working there later in life, that the
                    military really does have a greater sense of their esprit de corps than the
                    Foreign Service does. Maybe that's in part because they literally depend on one
                    another for their very lives. And maybe that creates a sense of working
                    together, helping one another. I found in retirement that the military officers
                    genuinely helped one another in terms of finding jobs or contacts, what have
                    you. This is the case far more than I find with the State Department and the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>In any case, even though the Pentagon was a large building, with lots of people
                    in it, one did find that more friendly atmosphere—even though it was a huge
                    bureaucracy. In my job as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, there was one
                    stop between me and the Secretary, and that was my boss, Assistant Secretary, in
                    this case Gene McCauliffe, also an FSO. That ability to get in touch directly
                    with the head of the organization was far greater in Pentagon for me than it was
                    at an equivalent job at the State Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>As for the substance, this began with the Ford administration. We were working on
                    ways to try to help the Defense Department get back on its feet—and our forces
                    in Europe in particular—after expenses and the cost of the Vietnam War. We began
                    that program. I also participated in a briefing of NATO Permanent
                    Representatives, which Secretary Rumsfeld instituted (he having earlier been
                    Ambassador to NATO) about the Soviet military buildup. It was on that occasion
                    that I had my first introduction to what later became a major part of my life's
                    work, the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces issue. We, for the first time,
                    showed the allies the situation that we were together beginning to face as a
                    result of the Soviets coming up with some very powerful new missiles. After the
                    change of the administration, I stayed on in that position, working on the same
                    questions with David McGiffert as the Assistant Secretary of Defense and Harold
                    Brown as the Secretary of Defense. I worked very closely also with Bob Komer and
                    our efforts there were to revitalize NATO, to ensure that the alliance would be
                    able to meet its defense commitments with sufficient revenues, new equipment,
                    etc. It was very serious, very important effort to try to get NATO back on its
                    feet after the Vietnam War. I stayed at that job until the summer of 1977. At
                    that point I had an opportunity to go overseas again and to serve as Deputy
                    Chief of Mission at NATO, with William Tapley “Tap” Bennett, Jr. as our
                    Ambassador. That brings us to the next phase. To round off this aspect, it was a
                    job that I very much enjoyed. I think I made some useful contributions to
                    national security on the job. In a way I was sorry to leave, but on the other
                    hand having an opportunity to deal with these problems in the field and meet
                    directly with our allies at NATO headquarters was also an important challenge,
                    so I looked forward to moving to Brussels.</p>
                <p>The DCM at NATO, in Brussels, had a house assigned to him. We had no need to find
                    a place to live. It was very pleasant with a nice large yard and a lawn. It was
                    obviously designed for entertaining downstairs. We did a lot of work to make
                    some improvements to the reception room. It also was not far from where we lived
                    to the For�t de Soignes, which was a large remnant of the European forest that
                    once had covered the continent. As I mentioned earlier I very much enjoy the
                    outdoors and one of the pleasures of living in that particular home was that I
                    was able to go out the door, and Chris with me, and the dog, or children, and
                    within a short couple of blocks we were in the forest. You could walk miles and
                    miles in this forest, once you got to know the paths. There were highways that
                    bisected it in some areas, but you could find out where the tunnels were to walk
                    under them, so it was nice to have something so close to your home for the
                    weekends at least when we weren't working, it was, as I said, very pleasurable.
                    We had to drive to work, but at this point I did have a driver. Certainly after
                    I got there, thanks to the security situation, we began to drive with armored
                    cars. In the beginning these were make-shift, large lumps of plastic over the
                    windows, I suppose some sort of steel in the doors, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had there been some problem that brought this about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: No problems specific to Belgium, but a worldwide problem at this point.
                    It did make a difference in our lives. From there on we would be living in that
                    kind of situation. On the weekends, we had our own vehicle and would just go. We
                    had purchased a Jeep Wagoneer, which wasn't the smartest thing to have at that
                    point, but we bought it before we knew we were going overseas, and it was with
                    the idea that we would use it to drive home to Vermont. It would have been a
                    good choice in that instance. But it was not to be, so we shipped the car to
                    Belgium. One of the procedures that we went through with that particular car was
                    that to meet Belgian rules and regulation, we had to change some of the wiring.
                    Belgians with their fog insisted on a separate fog lamp in the back, and they
                    didn't like yellow lights that we had in the front, parking lights, whatever you
                    call them. They had to be white. They made some other changes in the wiring.
                    I'll finish the story about this vehicle. We then, you'll find later, moved from
                    Brussels to Geneva and we took the Jeep with us, but the Swiss had different
                    wiring regulations, and so all the wiring was done over for Swiss specs. Then we
                    went briefly to Vienna, took the Jeep there— and Austrians had their wiring
                    arrangements. And then just to make everything nice and cozy the vehicle went
                    back to Brussels when we returned there later. We did finally ship the Jeep home
                    to the U.S. We paid for that ourselves on this occasion. It finally died in
                    Vermont, and you can guess how—the wiring harness burned out. It was too bad,
                    that was the end of the poor car. So many times, with these different rules and
                    regulations. That was another side of life in the service.</p>
                <p>While we are still on the more social side, and then I'll get to the substance,
                    we had a very heavy social schedule. Again, social life is work in another form.
                    But in Brussels, at NATO I should say, there really was a lot of activity. One
                    nice thing about NATO events and particularly the dinners was that they started
                    at eight and they ended at 11 p.m.; everybody arrived on time and everybody
                    departed on time. So you could pretty well count on it. Again, as was the case
                    in other diplomatic assignments, the dinner parties and the receptions were
                    opportunities to continue the work that had been going on during the day at the
                    office, but at least in a more informal setting. These events, and particularly
                    the dinners could be difficult for Chris or any of the other spouses. I could
                    see that often she'd be seated between two diplomats, or a diplomat and a
                    military officer, or two military officers, people who were working together all
                    day and had more business to transact during the evening. She would just find
                    herself sitting there while they talked past her. There was nothing I could do
                    about it and even today, even thinking about that circumstance, I feel badly
                    about it. I probably was guilty of doing it myself on the occasion. But it was
                    just the intensity of the work that I think led into that situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>The work itself covered just about every problem in the world. It's not the UN,
                    it's NATO, but when you begin to look at the issues that the NATO countries are
                    interested in and the way the organization is set up, sooner or later almost any
                    problem would find its way there, if only for experts' discussion. So NATO
                    doesn't deal say with Latin America or the Far East, but it was not unusual for
                    NATO Latin American experts or NATO Middle Eastern experts to come to a meeting
                    at NATO headquarters to discuss the subject. And you could see why, given the
                    nature of the alliance and its security role, this would be a perfectly sensible
                    approach so that the countries could cooperate on issues. It's well beyond the
                    boundaries of the NATO countries or the continents that they were located on. It
                    doesn't mean that we'd actually have a defense arrangement involved; we didn't.
                    But there was at least a discussion of these issues.</p>
                <p>There were fixed meetings of defense ministers and foreign ministers; they would
                    meet twice a year. In addition, the defense ministers would meet as an
                    organization called the “Nuclear Planning Group.” It was smaller, not all the
                    defense ministers participated in that forum, but most did eventually on a
                    rotational basis. That was another set of meetings, which defense ministers did.
                    Incidentally while I was at the Pentagon working on NATO issues, I would go to
                    those meetings as well, so I had continuity which carried over.</p>
                <p>We worked on a number of key issues during this time. One was continuation of
                    building our forces back up after the Vietnam War—in keeping with what was
                    clearly a buildup of Soviet forces. We were actively engaged in that. A project
                    that we put together (in which Bob Komer played a key role) was the long-term
                    defense program, which he helped shepherd through NATO. It entailed setting
                    specific goals: targets, both for results and for spending; 3% of GNP to go for
                    defense for all of the NATO countries; this was the expenditure goal. Then there
                    were specific goals each country agreed to meet to improve their forces.
                    Committees and groups were set up to monitor the progress in doing that. It was
                    a pretty thorough operation. I think it proved to be successful in helping NATO
                    not to get back on its feet but to compensate for its forces being drawn down
                    during Vietnam, and now to help deal with matching the Soviets and countering
                    the increasing Soviet expenditure. The other project we got involved in, and I
                    got deeply involved in was on the nuclear side. That culminated in a key
                    decision NATO reached on December 12, 1979.</p>
                <p>Perhaps I could say something about daily routine at NATO to give you an idea of
                    the amount of activity that we had there. We had a staff meeting every morning
                    when we came in to work. We went over the activities that were expected that
                    day. Practically everyone had one or two committees that they were charged with
                    following and attending in which they were representing the U.S. Some of these
                    committees would meet on a weekly basis, some a little less frequently, but it
                    gave everyone an opportunity to participate directly in the affairs of the
                    alliance because of the fact that there were enough committees for everyone to
                    have a role to play.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>The permanent representatives, “perm reps,” had two scheduled events every week.
                    One was a perm reps lunch, which took place on Tuesdays. The purpose of the
                    lunch was to allow informal discussion of subjects which were likely to come up
                    during the week in a more formal setting and for countries to try to get a sense
                    of how well their position would be received or what kinds of changes they may
                    have to make in it and/or what sort of changes they may want others to make in
                    their positions. The U.S.; ambassador or myself, one of us, would always be at
                    these perm rep lunches.</p>
                <p>Wednesdays were formal North Atlantic Council meetings. We'd always call that, of
                    course, “the NAC.” The perm reps would be present for that meeting. This was
                    formal occasion, as I said, and countries could put their position forward as a
                    formal country position. The agenda was usually set during the preceding week or
                    during the first part of the week, but normally you'd have a heads-up that such
                    and such items were on the agenda. The international staff (NATO has
                    international staff as well as country representatives) would sometimes be
                    tasked to devise the agendas. They would discuss these issues with the countries
                    delegations (national delegations) to get an idea of what different countries
                    might be proposing. Those were Wednesdays.</p>
                <p>On other days of the week, the special political committee, consisting of the
                    delegations' political officers, would meet. There was a once-a-week economic
                    committee. There were a lot of public affairs activities. We would have frequent
                    visitors from Washington. We welcomed them, particularly from the Congress. I
                    felt that when they came to NATO, they came for serious work. We tried very hard
                    to give them a clear picture of what was happening at the Alliance, how it would
                    affect the U.S., and how they could help the U.S. in its efforts at NATO. By and
                    large, I found most congressmen and senators helpful and anxious to be of
                    assistance to the Alliance.</p>
                <p>Twice a year there were ministerial level meetings for both political issues,
                    State Department and foreign ministers, and for defense ministers. For each of
                    those meetings, there was always a formal communiqu�. Larry Legere, the officer
                    who headed the defense side of our mission to NATO and who was formally the
                    Secretary of Defense's representative in Europe, and people working directly for
                    him in our mission would be responsible for putting together the communiqu� for
                    the defense ministers activities. I would clear all of those, as would
                    Ambassador Bennett at this time. We would clear those communiqu�s and would
                    assure that they were in keeping with broad U.S. policy. We never had any
                    serious problems with this effort. And those communiqu�s would be hammered out
                    by the staffs from the various NATO countries, usually at night. The next
                    morning the ministers would pass on them.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>For the foreign ministers' communiqu�s, the head of the political section would
                    work on the communiqu� during the lead up to the final night, and then I as DCM
                    would represent the U.S. at the final session. These sessions usually didn't
                    start till about eight or nine o'clock at night and they habitually went into
                    the small hours. I only know of one occasion, a meeting in Ankara, when we were
                    not able to finish. We heard the call to prayer at night as the sun went down
                    and we heard to call to prayer in the morning as the sun came up. We didn't make
                    it that night, as I recall. As I remember, the key issue had to do with a CSCE,
                    Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, question. I don't remember the
                    details, but I do remember that my British and French colleagues had very
                    differing views on how to deal with this problem. And exceptionally, they
                    exchanged a few sharp words during the course of the discussion. As always,
                    these things tended to work out. Normally, we'd be done at three, four o'clock
                    in the morning.</p>
                <p>My task was to get the communiqu�s to the Secretary of State as soon as he awoke,
                    so that he could read the communiqu� at breakfast and then, after he had read
                    it, I would usually be called in and asked questions about it, why this was that
                    way and how we came to that position and so on. I enjoyed those all-night
                    sessions. I did have an advantage; I am more of a night person then an early to
                    rise person, so as the night wore on, others wore out but I was still going.</p>
                <p>There were times when there were disagreements between us and the French.
                    Fortunately, I had a very good relationship with Jacques Jessel, who was the
                    French number two for most of time that I was at NATO. There were occasions, one
                    in particular, where he and I had reached an agreement between us on how to deal
                    with a problem and it felt we had resolved it. But, the person chairing the
                    group, who was normally one of the senior NATO staff members, at the last
                    minute, as Jacques and I were coming to agreement, you could see where the
                    compromise would arise, jumped in with his own solution; which got both of us
                    angry at him; because we could see that we were about to settle it. The Chair
                    was trying to be helpful, but it would have been good time for the person
                    chairing the meeting to sit back and let the two who were causing the problem,
                    so to speak, settle their differences. We did. Working with Jessel was very
                    helpful later, particularly as we got into some of the nuclear issues. And let
                    me turn now to those questions.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>The Long Term Defense Program that I had mentioned, where Komer had done a good
                    job in getting it going, dealt largely with conventional systems. This caused
                    some of our allies to wonder whether the U.S. was going to start downplaying its
                    nuclear commitment to NATO. And I made a point when the issue began to crop up
                    to make sure that Washington was aware of this sensitivity. As a result, we
                    decided to add another element to the Long Term Defense Program, which was to
                    examine NATO's nuclear requirements. The effort to get that element properly
                    included into the Long Term Defense Program absorbed a huge amount of time and
                    became extremely sensitive. The Allies, particularly some of the German leaders,
                    had evidenced concern that we were possibly going to give up the prospect of
                    having cruise missiles in the context of our bilateral SALT negotiations with
                    the Soviets.</p>
                <p>We conceded to the Allies that there was a great concern there. Specifically we
                    might be backing away from our nuclear commitment and that our negotiating on
                    strategic weapons could have the effect of not making it possible for the Allies
                    or us to field new systems in Europe with which we could directly protect the
                    Allies and directly counter new Soviet missiles, particularly the SS-20. This
                    was a three-war head missile, about 4,000 kilometers range, which was being
                    deployed in the Soviet Union in rather considerable numbers. We had nothing
                    really to counter it as such. Cruise missiles were a possibility, and just to
                    repeat myself to make sure it is clear, the Allies were saying, “Yes, but it
                    looks as if you may giving up on them in order to get your strategic treaty with
                    the Soviets, and that's going to leave us in a bad situation.” We tried very
                    hard to persuade the allies that there was no reason for concern. That is, we
                    could take care of their needs on the nuclear side with what we had. We were not
                    going to give up everything in order to satisfy the Soviets on the strategic
                    side; we had their concerns in mind; the targets were covered and so on. We made
                    a major effort to do that, but it didn't work. The concern was there.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>But then, in one of those ironies of history, about the time that we began to
                    say, alright, maybe the Europeans have a point; maybe, if they are concerned, we
                    ought to try to have some nuclear systems to back them up against the Soviet
                    threat. At this point, the Europeans began to have somewhat different views. And
                    part of this change on their side links back to the so-called “neutron bomb
                    affair.” About the time that I left the Pentagon, an article appeared in The
                    Washington Post, concerning a new warhead for U.S. weapons in Europe. The very
                    name itself was questionable. It was dubbed, by The Post, “the neutron bomb.”
                    That was a pejorative name for any kind of nuclear bomb, or any weapon, period.
                    If you start talking about neutrons, very unpleasant images will be flashing in
                    your mind, including the prospect that other parts of you could be
                    “neutronized,” so to speak, could be radiated. The purpose that the military had
                    in mind with this particular weapon—and it was not a toy—was to reduce the blast
                    effect of the weapon. When you reduce the amount of blast, you reduce the damage
                    to surrounding properties and people. The neutron effect was not the goal; the
                    goal was to reduce the blast. Another effect of reducing the blast was to
                    concentrate neutron waves. Those are dangerous developments, but again, it
                    doesn't cover a large area. What that means is that you could use, or threaten
                    to use, these weapons in somewhat more crowded areas—because you wouldn't be
                    blowing up houses and people. If you were looking for Soviet tanks, you could
                    get the tanks and limit the damage around them, “collateral damage” as the
                    military calls it. I have to back off for a moment and say there is obviously an
                    element of unreality, lack of reality in all of this. One wonders about the
                    value of these systems. But that's the theory that we were looking at and
                    working from at the time.</p>
                <p>The Soviet propaganda machine seized on these articles; the articles ran five
                    days in a row in Washington Post, and it was the headline story. I must admit my
                    favorite was a headline that read “Killer Bomb.” I had to say, what did you
                    expect this thing to do? Tickle them to death? But you can get from that
                    headline, the mood that they were in when they used that phrase, “killer bomb.”
                    Again, the image was there. This topic got picked up in Europe, and the flames
                    were fanned by the Soviet propaganda machine. We had some evidence of that
                    having been in effect. Much of this activity was centered in the beginning in
                    the Netherlands. Chris and I went up one weekend, just to look around and see,
                    and we both noticed large full color posters in windows, “Stop the neutron
                    bomb.” And there was this awful American weapon, the neutron bomb, that had to
                    be stopped. We also picked up on a corner, a pathetic mimeographed 8”x10” sheet
                    that read "Stop the SS-20 Rockets,” but you could see that the heavy funding was
                    going to the opponents of U.S./NATO deployment and not to opponents of Soviet
                    missile deployment. As I said, history articles have been published that
                    corroborated the fact that the funding was coming from the Soviet Union.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>There was an effort, still, underway at NATO, to go ahead with this weapon; and
                    the U.S. put a lot of effort, as our embassies did, as the Secretary of State
                    did, as the Secretary of Defense did, with their colleagues in NATO-Europe to
                    support this particular program. Ambassador Bennett and I were scheduled to have
                    a meeting on this topic with perm reps, I think it was going to be on a Monday,
                    which was unusual timing, to discuss this issue and to reach a final conclusion.
                    We sent a telegram in, saying that it was going to be a tough fight, and there
                    were some concerns with various other countries whether they would go through
                    with it in the end. But we believed that we did have the votes, and there would
                    be support for this if we wanted to go ahead with it.</p>
                <p>I received a phone call the night before Bennett and I were scheduled to see the
                    NATO Secretary General Joseph Luns, lay out our posture for the meeting, and get
                    his support for what we were going to do during this meeting with the perm reps
                    at which the decision was to be made. That night, Friday or Saturday night,
                    before the meeting was to take place, I got a phone call from Washington, late
                    at night, I was still up but Chris had fallen asleep, it was after midnight.
                    Person on the other end, I remember who it was but I won't go into it, said to
                    me, “Are you sitting down?” I said, “No.” He said, “Well, you'd better because
                    when I tell you this you are going to want to be sitting.” And he just said in
                    effect, this was in “double talk” but I knew what he was talking about, and he
                    just said, “It is all off. The position has been changed; you'll have a message
                    in the morning. We know you are going to see Luns, you'd better read this
                    message before you talk to him.” And of course the message told us that
                    President Carter had effectively said that this was going to be delayed. We
                    eventually had the meeting with the Allies.</p>
                <p>I reported back that there was a lot of rancor and anger by the Europeans at the
                    fact that we had gone this far with them, they were ready to move, and here we
                    were, backing away, delaying the process which in effect meant killing it. That
                    day the Soviets, I think, drew the conclusion that if they could get the
                    European “peace movement” on their side, through a major propaganda effort, they
                    could turn NATO around on issues of this sort. And that conclusion had a major
                    impact on our program to improve NATO's defense posture and to include a nuclear
                    element to that posture. So it was in my view a very costly move by President
                    Carter. From what I can tell, his cabinet secretaries were not aware that he was
                    going to do this either. I have read the president's memoirs, and he suggests
                    that they were all on board and that the Europeans were on board with his move.
                    But from my research, I don't see that conclusion and, from talking to people
                    who were working for other involved cabinet officers at this time, they also
                    told me that cabinet officers were caught totally off base by this decision. The
                    so called “neutron bomb affair” was very costly for us. I tried to get the name
                    changed, and tried very hard to get at least ourselves, the U.S. officials
                    talking to one another, to stop calling it the neutron bomb, we could call it
                    the reduced blast bomb, because that was what the scientists were aiming for.
                    But, despite using it myself, I could never get anything back from Washington,
                    rarely got anything back from Washington, trying to change the name. It was
                    probably too late to do that anyway.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>With that issue in the background, we were still continuing to try to work with
                    the Europeans to determine what we were going to do about the Soviet nuclear
                    build up and how we were going to handle it. Our initial effort was to try to
                    persuade them that there wasn't a problem. We then came around and realized that
                    if they thought there was a problem, then there was. We were dealing here with
                    perceptions as much as reality, and if that was their perception—that we were
                    going to abandon them—then we had a problem that we had to work on together.
                    Because, as I said, as we began to move in that direction, the Europeans,
                    particularly the Germans, began to wonder just how much they could do. The way
                    that we dealt with this perception, and I think this was really a very crucial
                    decision, was not to say, “Well, this is our negotiation, and we are going to do
                    it all ourselves, with the Soviets.” It was essential to say to the Europeans,
                    “We were in this together; we are going to have full, complete consultations;
                    and we will set up a separate, new body in NATO. It will be chaired by an
                    American, but it will be wide open for every country to be represented and all
                    of their views will be taken into account.”</p>
                <p>This began with an organization called the “High Level Group,” which was going to
                    look at the deployments (possible deployments) and the “Special Consultative
                    Group” which would look at the diplomatic arms control side. So we began; I
                    attended most of these meetings in my capacity as the DCM. One of the procedures
                    I quickly adopted was to suggest that there be dinners, which I would host at
                    our house, before the actual meetings, so that we could sit down and have an
                    informal discussion amongst ourselves—all the allies together. And if there were
                    any specific concerns or suggestions that countries wanted to try out in an
                    informal session, we could do that. The other idea I had in mind was to create a
                    club—to make this effort like a club. We had a very small dining room, but we
                    made changes to this so we could accommodate more people, so that we had enough
                    room at the table for everybody. There were a couple of countries that would
                    have particular issues for us, and we would have them come over little bit
                    before for drinks or something, before the dinner. That would provide an
                    opportunity for that sort of smaller group to discuss things. The whole point
                    was to make this effort into true consultations. The SCG met usually at NATO.
                    Richard Pearle headed up the HLG. Richard had a reputation; I think “Prince of
                    Darkness” was his nickname. That may be how he appeared to some people, but I
                    can only say that in his capacity as the chairman of this international group,
                    he was not anything like the caricature that had been created of him. He was a
                    superb chairman. I must say there were times when I would have been harder nosed
                    than he was in dealing with some of the suggestions. But he bent over backwards
                    to bring people along with him. There was never any sense of threat, that we
                    were going to walk out, or arrogance on his part. And he was good company.
                    Because the U.S. military had bases here and there, instead of coming to
                    Brussels all the time, he would arrange for these meetings of the High Level
                    Group (the defense side of the discussions) in places like Naples or Garmisch,
                    and so on. And again, he was building a club. People felt that they were a part
                    of this group, and that they were building this process: they wanted to work
                    together. So it was very effective. On the foreign ministry side, the State
                    Department side, they didn't travel outside Brussels, but we continued the
                    events at our house. We always had dinners that were a social get-together
                    before they actually went to the conference table.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Now, on the substance. We had a lot of alternatives and objectives. And they had
                    to work together. What sort of missiles would we agree to deploy? How many? And
                    where? And on the arms control side, what sort of arms control regime did we
                    want to field with the deployment program? This process took until, as I
                    mentioned earlier, December 12, 1979, when it came together. We came up with,
                    effectively this proposal: Here is what we are going to deploy; we are prepared
                    to take everything out if we get everything out from the Soviets' side. It was
                    from the beginning an effort to try to get to zero. Or at least the lowest
                    possible number. But we didn't want to put out a huge number. We tried to keep
                    it low. Our own forces to start with. All that had begun, I can't emphasize
                    enough how important it was, that it all be done in consultation. The numbers
                    were agreed by all of us, the U.S. didn't impose anything on the others. On the
                    contrary, some of the smaller countries had extremely good representatives.
                    Johan Jorgen Holst of Norway, who was later instrumental in the Oslo Peace
                    Accords for the Middle East, was his country's representative on the HLG I
                    believe, as well as on the SCG. And even though Norway doesn't have nuclear
                    weapons and doesn't host any nuclear weapons, he had some good ideas. So those
                    ideas found their way to a position. Fred Ruth was the German representative on
                    the SCG, obviously Germany was an important country with great interest in this
                    negotiation. But again, Ruth's personality, his knowledge, and abilities, were
                    put to full value in this kind of circumstance; you can see his ideas are in
                    there. I could go on and mention many others, but I don't think anybody would
                    say, “This is mine.” The “club” put it together. The group put it together. And
                    that was the position that we carried with us into the INF negotiations. Again,
                    we had the strength of being able to say to the Soviets, “You can't split this
                    alliance; all of us agree on this.” It wasn't just the U.S., it was all of us.
                    And, as we will see as I discuss this process further, the Soviets tried their
                    best to split the Alliance, but for an American negotiator I had the 1979
                    decision, in writing, published and those were the principles that we were going
                    to follow. It was an important moment. I think we set the standard for what
                    consultations were supposed to be in that process.</p>
                <p>I don't want to leave the DCM at NATO without saying a few words about Tap
                    Bennett, who was the Ambassador during my entire time there. He was a remarkable
                    man. He was always very calm and went about his work in cheerful way. Calm and
                    cheerful. He knew what he wanted, and he had a remarkable way of using his low
                    key approach to get it. His wife Margaret was also an exceptional person. Very
                    cultured. She wrote beautifully. We know that because her Christmas cards were,
                    and are, a delight to receive. In part because of the quality of the writing
                    that she does, in something as simple as a Christmas card. Tap was very good at
                    dealing with senior people—particularly with the Secretary of State and
                    especially with the congressmen and the senators. He just had a marvelous way of
                    making them feel comfortable and himself being comfortable around them. I wish I
                    had that quality myself. I used to look at that and say, “Well, that's really a
                    wonderful trait.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where there quite a few congressional visits to NATO while
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: Yes. And I think I may have mentioned earlier that when they came to
                    Paris while we were there, we had a fair number of visits. Part of it was work,
                    but part of it was not. I'd say it was part work and part “other stuff.” But
                    when they came to NATO, they came to work. They came to learn about the
                    organization and how issues were proceeding at that time; they had specific
                    questions to ask. Obviously it was of importance to us that they came away from
                    NATO with a correct view of the organization—to know its flaws as well as its
                    strong qualities. We wanted them to know how they might be able to keep it
                    working properly and in America's interest. There were lots of visits and, I
                    think by and large, as I have said, these were serious visits.</p>
                <p>There are a couple of other aspects of this process that I would like to mention
                    at this juncture. First, I think it is useful to know who was in charge of the
                    HLG and the SCG during the period leading up to this important decision in
                    December 1979. Dave McGiffert, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International
                    Security Affairs, headed the U.S. team going to the HLG. And Reginald
                    Bartholomew, I don't know precisely what position Reggie was holding at that
                    time, but he headed the SCG team. Both of them did a superb job. Indeed, we were
                    very fortunate throughout the period of negotiations, beginning with this
                    period, this lead up to the '79 decision and continuing until the ratification.
                    The people who represented and chaired the meeting for the U.S. side of the HLG
                    and the SCG were all superb. Each one of them had their special qualities, and
                    it just seemed that the right person, with the right qualities, was in the right
                    job at the right time. I wanted to give those two people credit for having
                    brought that decision to fruition.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>The decision itself merits a little more discussion. I pointed out that it became
                    the basis for the U.S. negotiating position. It had several principles which we
                    carried with us into the negotiations and which we would not and did not
                    abandon. Among these points, perhaps the key objective was that we made clear
                    that any future limitations on U.S. systems, principally designed for theater
                    missions, should be accompanied by appropriate limitations on Soviet theater
                    systems. In other words, there would be no unilateral disarmament. We said
                    limitations on U.S. and Soviet long range theater nuclear system should be
                    negotiated bilaterally in the SALT-3 framework in a step-by-step approach. There
                    was no SALT-3, but the key point was that it would be a bilateral negotiation
                    between us and the Soviets. That also remained part of the process, and it was
                    very important issue. The immediate objective of negotiations should be the
                    establishment of agreed limitations on U.S. and Soviet land based, long range
                    theater nuclear missile systems, and what we were doing in these discussions was
                    defining what systems we believe we should be subjects of the negotiations. You
                    will note that aircraft are excluded and anything that has to do with ship-based
                    systems would also be excluded from the negotiation. We stuck with that
                    principle throughout the negotiation. Any agreed limitations on these systems
                    must be consistent with the principle of equality between the sides. Therefore,
                    the limitations should take the form of de jure equality both in ceilings and in
                    rights; that was the key crucial principle. The Soviets had many more systems at
                    the beginning of the negotiations than we did. And one of their constant themes
                    was “We have to reduce more to get down to a low number.” And our counter to
                    that was, “It doesn't matter who has to reduce how much of what. There should be
                    no bonus for having produced more and going first. What really matters is that
                    we end up at an equal number for the U.S. and the Soviet Union.” In addition, we
                    talked about adequate verifiability and we made verification a very important
                    principle for us throughout the negotiation. Those were really the basic
                    guidelines, if you will, that the American negotiators took into the
                    negotiations. I think we can say without any doubt that at the end of the
                    negotiations all of those principles were found in the treaty; all of those
                    principles were maintained. And the fact that they came out of this process of
                    consultation strengthened our hand enormously, in insisting that these
                    principles form the backbone of the treaty itself.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>While we had these principles and a strong agreement within the alliance, we
                    could not move to negotiate, unless we had a negotiating partner. Unfortunately,
                    in December 1979, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. That put a whole new light on
                    the prospects of negotiating with them. I should have added that we also made a
                    move on the Mutual Balanced Force Reductions (MBFR) negotiation, in December
                    1979 to try to give some impetus to that negotiation, which dealt with
                    conventional weapons in Europe. That negotiation and the prospect of an INF
                    negotiation both looked good as we came away from the December 12 decision, but
                    the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan put them both in sort of a cold storage for a
                    while. We continued to try to persuade the Soviets to respond to our initiative,
                    to see if they would come to the table, throughout 1980, even with the Afghan
                    invasion in the background. But it really wasn't until Helmut Schmidt, the
                    German Chancellor, visited Moscow in the fall of 1980 that the Soviets began to
                    show interest and began to hint that there could be some negotiation. I think it
                    is important to note that it was the German Chancellor's visit that acted as a
                    catalyst for the Soviet response. Germany was crucial in the entire INF picture.
                    The Soviets spent a lot of time and effort trying to persuade elements of the
                    German public to take a friendlier view towards them and more negative views
                    toward NATO. It was a form of battleground for people's support. We'll see in
                    the end that the ballot box was more important than the people demonstrating in
                    the streets. But the Soviets at this point were not yet persuaded of that
                    reality. We'll see that eventually they did become persuaded.</p>
                <p>In any case, following Schmidt's discussion with Brezhnev, it took a while but
                    eventually the U.S. and the Soviet Union agreed to preliminary talks, talks
                    about talks, which would involve Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF
                    systems), and they agreed to begin in Geneva in October 1980. These talks only
                    lasted for a month. We had an election, as you may recall, at this point. But
                    they did cover a good deal of ground. I went back and read all the memorandums
                    on their conversations and verbatim text from both sides that were exchanged, in
                    preparation for going to Geneva. Anything that we had to cover for the rest of
                    the negotiation came up at these preliminary talks, so they were useful in
                    helping define where the sides positions were to start with. Of course, after
                    only a month, we couldn't get too much further along.</p>
                <p>As I said, there was an election and Ronald Reagan became the president of the
                    United States. The change of administration, of course, meant a new look at all
                    policies, which is a normal event in the U.S., and among the issues that came up
                    for a new look was the INF issues and whether there should or should not be
                    negotiations. There was indeed some question regarding whether there would be
                    negotiations. There were some officials in the administration who were opposed
                    to the negotiations. But in the end, the decision was made to move forward and
                    to conduct negotiations with the Soviet Union. It took another year after the
                    election before those negotiations did begin. But they would be a major element
                    of the rest of my career.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, we'll now move into late 1981-1984. You'd been
                        appointed Deputy Negotiator with the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces
                        Negotiations with the rank of Ambassador in Geneva. How did this job come
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: As you've seen, I was very deeply involved with the whole INF issue and
                    had been for some time. It was almost natural that I would continue to see this
                    issue through, hopefully to its successful conclusion. Not being a military man,
                    I could not be a part of the deployment aspect of the development, which was the
                    agreement reached in '79 to deploy weapons. But I did feel that I could make a
                    contribution to the arms control negotiation side. And I made my interest known.
                    I was, at one point, the State Department's candidate for the position of Chief
                    Negotiator, but the decision was made to appoint someone who had far greater
                    experience and certainly was better known, to the job of the Chief Negotiator
                    (that person was Paul Nitze), and I would be the Deputy Negotiator with the rank
                    of ambassador.</p>
                <p>Nitze was the first Washington official I had ever laid eyes on. It was at a
                    conference on national security issues, with senior students selected by their
                    university, in my case the University of Illinois. I don't recall what he said,
                    but I remember the positive reaction I had to it and to him. When I returned to
                    Washington, after the arrangements had been made that he would be the chief
                    negotiator and I would be his deputy, I joined in the U.S. delegation's
                    preparation for the opening round of the INF negotiations.</p>
                <p>I soon found that Nitze and I approached problems in a similar manner. In our
                    delegation meetings, all ideas, regardless of who proposed them were considered
                    and subject to a rigorous logic check. It they passed the check, they were
                    adopted. If one part of an argument was questionable, it had to be dropped. If
                    the proposition could not stand without that argument, the proposition would be
                    discarded. When Nitze's contributions were subjected to the process, he was, to
                    his credit, quite prepared to rethink his position if he or the group concluded
                    that someone else had a better idea or formulation. This rigorous examination
                    really was the key to the delegations ability to put forward logical, well
                    constructed papers.</p>
                <p>Nitze was and still is a remarkable human being in every sense. Not only is he
                    remarkable intellectually, but also physically. He was in his '70s and we used
                    to ski with him, and he continued to be active. He is just a remarkable human
                    being. I very much enjoyed working with him. I learned a lot from him.</p>
                <p>I should also note that the one other thing we shared, Nitze and I, and that was
                    appreciating the value of “constructive ambiguity” and “bifurcated clarity” in
                    situations where it might be necessary temporarily to put aside a difference
                    during the negotiating process. But we also both saw no room for this device in
                    the formulation of the treaty which would legally bind the U.S. Again, there was
                    that rigor which he had and I felt very much akin to and tried to continue when
                    I took over as the chief negotiator. It was a very positive element in our
                    ability to work closely together.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>In preparing to go to Geneva, Nitze asked our legal advisor, Tom Graham, who was
                    from the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), to begin the process of
                    drafting the treaty; the final version of which would mark the culmination of
                    the negotiating efforts. Getting an early start on this task helped us ensure
                    that we would be able to prepare a draft of the treaty early on and thus improve
                    the prospects that negotiations would in effect be, but without anyone making a
                    point of it, worked from our draft. Again, this was a process in which we
                    continued to try to stay ahead. The legal writing was ahead, our views would be
                    available in legal form early on, so that when the discussion began to turn on a
                    specific issue, whatever section of the treaty you are looking at, we had a text
                    down and the other side did not. Our text essentially became a working document.
                    The Soviets could say, “Take this paragraph out, put this paragraph in,” but
                    they would work from our document. And again, Nitze showed great foresight and
                    acumen in getting that process started early. I can assure you that I followed
                    that same pattern as well.</p>
                <p>In addition to the legal aspects of the treaty and the tactical aspects of the
                    negotiation, there was one point that I worked very hard to get across within
                    our delegation. Noting the political nature of the INF issue, I urged that the
                    substance of our position, as reflected in the draft treaty, be rooted in the
                    '79 decision. This was not SALT; this was not a bilateral strategic negotiation
                    involving only U.S. and Soviet interests. In the INF issue, we were acting as
                    agents for NATO allies as well as for the U.S. We would have failed, if we had
                    ended with an agreement which was technically sound from the U.S. standpoint but
                    which left the allies with an impression that their interests had not been
                    adequately taken into account. To ensure that this did not happen, the
                    negotiator would need to remain in close contact with the SCG process, at the
                    North Atlantic Council, at NATO headquarters, and directly with NATO capitals.
                    One of the reasons I was given the rank of ambassador was to permit me to carry
                    out those duties, in an effective way, with the Europeans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After all these preparations, we get to Geneva?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: Yes. Before Geneva, Nitze and I went to call on Helmut Schmidt and the
                    German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher. Days before the actual beginning
                    of the negotiations we were in Bonn and in Hamburg to meet with Schmidt. We were
                    underscoring the effort we made to keep the allies fully informed of what we
                    were doing. Obviously the Germans were key because the Pershing missiles were
                    going to be deployed only in Germany and the cruise missiles would be deployed
                    in Germany plus four other basing countries, the U.K., Italy, Belgium and the
                    Netherlands. Indeed it was symbolic of the underlying nature of this negotiation
                    that our first task on the opening day of the negotiations was to meet with the
                    group of European parliamentarians. We reviewed and compared the negotiating
                    positions of both sides, noted the importance of allied solidarity (including
                    continuing with the deployments) to achieve an agreement. Even as we prepared to
                    meet with Soviets, you could see how important keeping the allies on board
                    was—not just on board, but working closely with them. I particularly took
                    seriously this concept of being an agent for them as well as for ourselves.</p>
                <p>The building we moved into is called the “Botanic”; it's in Geneva of course, and
                    it's across from the botanical gardens. It is not too far from other UN offices,
                    and on a nice day, you could walk to it. The American mission in Geneva was in a
                    separate building, up the hill from us and the UN offices, so it was a little
                    climb to get there. But we were not housed at the U.S. mission; we were housed
                    in this Botanic building. It had been originally constructed by a financier,
                    Bernard Cornfeld, I believe the name was. I think he went bankrupt. I hoped that
                    wasn't going to happen to us. I had been in that building earlier because the
                    U.S. delegation to the GATT was also housed in that building, so I was familiar
                    with it. It had a certain number of drawbacks from the security standpoint. The
                    building was also home to the Hungarian delegation to the UN. Obviously, that
                    wasn't too comfortable. The West Germans were also located in the building and,
                    in fact, shared a wall with us. That wall was in our main room where we met with
                    the Soviets for plenary sessions.</p>
                <p>Let me say a little bit now about how we actually worked. Twice a week, we would
                    have plenary meetings. These would be formal sessions, full delegations would be
                    present, and we would have prepared a paper, without any idea what Soviets were
                    going to prepare. And they would have prepared a paper without any idea of what
                    we were going to prepare. These were formal documents that we exchanged. And on
                    both sides they were stamped “Secret.” So we were giving over secret papers to
                    the Soviets, and receiving secret papers from the Soviets. In fact, at one
                    point, we had a security investigation and somebody asked one of our people,
                    “Did you have secret papers,” “Oh, yes.” “And what about the Soviets?” “Well, we
                    gave some secret papers to them.” And the security man was quite upset. I had to
                    explain to him that this was a normal exchange. But, the fact that we did
                    exchange these papers meant that we had to be extremely careful in how we wrote
                    them. Anything we put in those papers could be used against us. We took great
                    care—I think I mentioned that point earlier—we took great care in preparing
                    these papers, almost as if they were the treaty itself. Because we realized that
                    you are giving over a hostage to fortune when you turned over one of those
                    papers to the Soviets.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>After the formal meetings, we would divide into subgroups. The ambassador and the
                    committees would meet. I would be there with Ambassador Nitze. On the Soviet
                    side it was Ambassador Kvitsinsky and General [Nikolay] Detinov. It would be the
                    four of us who would meet. Then the senior people from the foreign ministries on
                    the delegations would meet in a somewhat larger group, maybe instead of just
                    four maybe six, maybe eight people, three or four on each side. The military
                    people had a table of their own. There would be coffee, soft drinks, and snacks
                    on these tables. The intelligence people would have their own table, even though
                    they were all supposed to be unknown to anyone else, they quite quickly figured
                    out who was who and that's where they would sit together.</p>
                <p>A few more points that I wanted to add. One was that in addition to all the other
                    tenants that I mentioned, there were several commercial firms in this building,
                    in the Botanic, including a lighting company which never seemed to have any
                    customers and which closed its doors when the U.S. arms control delegations
                    moved out of the building in the late 1990s. That was the Zonea Electric
                    Company, and we always kind of wondered about it but never could say anything
                    definitive. It was clearly not ideal from the security stand-point, and it would
                    become less so when terrorism also became a major concern.</p>
                <p>We also uncovered another fault, or rather my wife did. When I described the
                    office situation to Chris, I also noted that there were problems with the
                    stairwells should we need rapidly to evacuate the building. However, I said,
                    there were fire escape stairs. “How do you know they are open at the street
                    level,” she asked. “I don't,” I said. “Maybe you should walk down those stairs,”
                    she replied. I did. They were locked tight. Neither the crash button, which
                    should have opened the doors with a push, nor the regular door lock would
                    budge.</p>
                <p>Corrections were made. On the positive side, the Botanic offices were bright and
                    cheerful. And the main conference room, which doubled as a reception room,
                    offered a fine view of the Alps. A fair amount of our time at the office was
                    spent in a secure conference room which was lacking most of these
                    characteristics and amenities.</p>
                <p>Let me describe a typical day for us; a plenary day in particular. Members and
                    advisors would read the overnight cable traffic and the newspapers. They would
                    individually consider what developments and reactions might flow from the “take”
                    and perhaps discuss this with one or two others. The delegation would meet
                    around 10:00 a.m.; our first task was to go over the formal U.S. plenary
                    statement, due to be presented on that day, and ensure that it was factually
                    correct and accurately got across our points. An advisor would have been
                    assigned to draft a statement, which would have been developed in outline form
                    in an earlier delegation meeting, and already subject to at least one or two
                    reviews. The entire delegation would once again go over the draft, fine-tuning
                    it if necessary. It would then be put into final form and translated into
                    Russian. The English version was considered authoritative, and the Russian
                    version was a courtesy to allow non-English speakers on the Soviet side to refer
                    to the U.S. statement during the discussions. Both would be handed, as I said,
                    to the Russians.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Having approved the statement (we are still in our delegation meeting—our
                    internal meeting), we would then rehearse the arguments in its favor. Finally,
                    we would discuss what we thought the Soviets might introduce at the meeting, how
                    they might react to our statement, and how we should react to their remarks.
                    This is something that I introduced, that is, “what are they likely to come up
                    with?” We would use the precision of a rifle in laying out our position, and the
                    wide coverage of the shotgun when considering what the Soviets might have in
                    store for us. I had, as I said, introduced this approach to help reduce the
                    chances of being caught unaware and thus to improve the chances of acting
                    appropriately and confidently and not having to improvise on the spot. By and
                    large, the system worked.</p>
                <p>The Plenary session would normally begin around 11:00 a.m. with the exchange of
                    the formal statements. And then, as I pointed out, we would break into smaller
                    groups. Normally, this would go on until past the normal noon hour. But, in any
                    case, once the meeting did formally conclude, if it were held in our place, I
                    would normally escort Ambassador Kvitsinsky and General Detinov out of the
                    building, which afforded another opportunity to gauge the Soviet reactions to
                    the meeting or reinforce one of our points as we went down the elevator and out
                    the door.</p>
                <p>As I said, the meetings would break up about one or two in the afternoon. We'd go
                    back to our secure conference room and exchange views and reports on the formal
                    and informal meeting. “What did you think this meant?” “How did you feel about
                    that comment?” We would analyze the Soviet remarks for any hints of movement or
                    signs of retrenchment, and offer our estimates of Soviet reaction to our
                    presentation. Then we would consider what suggestions we might make to
                    Washington for tactical or strategic moves. Summary reports, including analysis
                    and action recommendations, would be prepared on each of the meetings and sent
                    out at the end of the day; which often meant well after normal closing time.
                    Interpreters prepared verbatim reports of the meetings, and all of this material
                    was put together in a package. Norm Clyne, who was a very able delegation
                    executive, was responsible for doing that. After he finished, Nitze and I would
                    review and approve each of the reports before they were sent. It all made for a
                    very long day. After leaving the office, many of the U.S. team, including the
                    support staff, would go out together for dinner and then to their respective
                    hotel rooms for calls back home and bed.</p>
                <p>The negotiations were broken down into rounds which would last approximately two
                    months. Rounds would then be followed by two months in capitals. The chief, the
                    deputy chief, and immediate staff and the members were expected to stay the
                    course of the negotiation, the advisors and most of the support staff might skip
                    every other round. Most of the members were accompanied by their spouses, but
                    the advisors usually came alone.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>Recognizing the importance of continued close consultation with the European
                    allies, I opted to be based in Geneva after the first round, and to use the
                    inter-round period to attend SCG or HLG meetings; visit NATO capitals and meet
                    with government and opposition leaders; attend conferences where INF was the
                    main topic of discussion; and generally get our points across to opinion
                    leaders, to the media, and to the public. I would usually return with the
                    delegation to Washington for the debriefings and the determination of work
                    assignments in the inter-round period. Then I would return to Washington again
                    in time to participate in the final preparation of our instructions for the next
                    round and return to Geneva with the delegation. I should add that there was some
                    opposition to my staying in Geneva as opposed to being home-based in Washington.
                    But given the task that I had before me, it seemed to me that I ought to live
                    and work on the same continent. And in the end, Washington approved, and it
                    meant that I was able to make the rounds (as I pointed out) to the European
                    capitals to reinforce the sense and reality of consultation with the allies.</p>
                <p>Regardless of where one was home-based, whether or not spouses were along, the
                    continuing back and forth movement, plus being away from home for extended
                    periods, was not conducive to a normal family life. Nitze's Secretary, Nancy
                    Jenkins, had at one point been the social director at an officer's club. She
                    (and the military assigned to the negotiations) understood the importance of
                    maintaining morale in such circumstances. She organized weekly events, movies on
                    some occasions, square dances and others events. An end-of-round party provided
                    an opportunity to let off steam by skits and application of topical lyrics to
                    well known tunes. Despite efforts such as these, by the time the negotiation had
                    ended, there were some divorces, balanced by some weddings. Most, however,
                    adapted to the unusual rhythm of life as best as one could.</p>
                <p>Let's get to the very first meeting. It was held at the Soviet delegation. They
                    lived in a compound with a large wall around it. There was one old mansion which
                    was used for some events, and I believe we held our first meeting in what must
                    have been a dining room in that building. Then they had some newer buildings.
                    Many of the Soviet delegates lived in those buildings. I gather they had a
                    communal kitchen and a restaurant. Some of them lived in hotels as most of our
                    people did, but the majority of them lived within the compound. The first
                    meeting began there. Of course the press was busy; we sort of waved to the media
                    and walked in.</p>
                <p>As we expected, both sides at the first meeting laid out in broad terms their
                    basic positions and the reasoning behind them. We underlined the concerns of the
                    U.S. and its allies, as laid out in the December 1979 NATO decision, and the
                    principles that were embodied in that decision. We highlighted the principle of
                    an equal outcome, explaining why it was essential to a balanced agreement. We
                    reviewed the arguments for concentrating on long range INF missiles and placing
                    global limits on them. And we noted the importance of incorporating an effective
                    verification regime within the treaty.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>The Soviets had been proposing a moratorium on any new line of missiles in
                    Europe, via the media, before the negotiations began. Not surprisingly, at the
                    first plenary meeting, they put forward a proposal for a moratorium on the
                    deployment or preparation for deployment, of new or additional INF systems in
                    Europe. As you can easily see, this was a patently one-sided position which
                    would have left the Soviet Union with over 1,000 war heads on its INF missiles
                    while the U.S. would be frozen at zero. While it was patently one-sided, as we
                    will see, it was not unusual. Very often they seemed to like moratoriums when we
                    didn't have anything and they had something. They became less fond of them when
                    we began to deploy ourselves.</p>
                <p>While the Soviet plenary statement contained no surprises, the informal session
                    was surprisingly revealing of the Soviet position, and Kvitsinsky's view of the
                    relations between states. Kvitsinsky, General Detinov, Ambassador Nitze, and I,
                    as well as two interpreters—one Soviet and one American—were at the first post
                    plenary meeting. Kvitsinsky began by saying he wanted to tell us a joke about a
                    rabbit and a bear. The two were traveling in the same train compartment. Some
                    time after the train had left the station, the rabbit began feverishly searching
                    his pockets and then let out a gasp. “Ah!” “What's wrong,” asked the bear. “I
                    seem to have lost my ticket,” replied the rabbit. “So what,” said the bear. “So
                    what,” exclaimed the rabbit. “When the conductor comes around he will find that
                    I have no ticket and have me locked up!” “Don't worry,” said the bear, “I can
                    take care of it.” Kvitsinsky had a great bass voice. “How,” asked the rabbit.
                    “Well,” the bear said, “when the conductor knocks on the door, I'll pick you up
                    by the ears and hold you out the window. I will give him my ticket and he won't
                    know you are here.” Assured that the powerful bear would protect him, the rabbit
                    calmly awaited the conductor's arrival. Then, as promised, when the conductor
                    knocked on the door, the bear picked up the rabbit by his ears, and held him out
                    the window of the speeding train. “Where is your ticket,” the conductor asked.
                    “Right here,” the bear said, showing his ticket with his right hand. “And what
                    to you have in your other hand,” the conductor asked. “Nothing,” the bear
                    replied, pulling his now empty left hand out of the window.</p>
                <p>I should add that our plenary statement had made several references to the
                    importance we placed on serving the interests of our NATO allies. Nitze and I
                    concluded that Kvitsinsky's joke was meant as an object lesson for how a great
                    power should deal with their allies. We were astonished by Kvitsinsky's near
                    recklessness in a situation where anything you say can and will be used against
                    you, in suggesting so openly to us that this is how the Soviets would act if
                    they were in our place. And it was his failure to understand that we neither
                    would nor could play the role of the bear. I did not fail to repeat the joke in
                    future meetings with NATO allies.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>The bear story clearly reveals one of the more serious issues we had with the
                    Soviets, basically how you deal with allies. But there were also many other
                    fundamental differences. And the first among these was a basic disagreement over
                    whether the U.S. and its NATO allies had the legitimate right to deploy U.S.
                    nuclear missiles in Europe capable of reaching targets in the Soviet Union. The
                    U.S. and its European allies based their position on the inherent right to
                    individual and collective self-defense accorded by Article 51 of the UN charter.
                    This inherent right underlies the foundation of the North Atlantic Treaty
                    Alliance. The Soviet position in denying that the U.S. and its allies had the
                    right to deploy U.S. missiles in Europe in defense of NATO presented, in effect,
                    a challenge to the legitimacy of NATO itself. In devising proposals, which in
                    all of their variations had a common theme, that is no deployment of U.S. INF in
                    Europe while the Soviets maintained all of their new SS-20s and modern medium
                    range aircraft as well, the Soviets were seeking to give practical and juridical
                    legitimacy to their claim that the U.S. had no role to play in Europe, that the
                    issue of INF missiles was one for Europeans to handle alone.</p>
                <p>Kvitsinsky understood this. At one of our early meetings when I noted the Soviet
                    unwillingness to move in our direction, he replied that their very participation
                    in these negotiations with the U.S. was in itself a major concession. And given
                    the Soviet point of departure he was right. But in making his comment, he also
                    acknowledged that the Soviet Union knowingly accepted the premise of our
                    position by agreeing to the talks. It remained to be seen whether the practical
                    outcome of the negotiations would further support the underlying U.S. and NATO
                    position.</p>
                <p>Another underlying philosophical and political force was a question of principle.
                    Should the outcome be based on equal reductions, as the Soviets argued, or on an
                    equal outcome as the U.S. proposed. And connected to this issue was the Soviet
                    insistence that U.K. and French nuclear forces be taken into account in
                    determining the existing and future balance of INF missiles and aircraft among
                    the U.S., NATO, and the Soviet Union. No other issue in the negotiating process
                    took up more time than this fundamental nexus of linked questions of legitimacy,
                    the nature of equality, and the bilateral nature of the negotiations.</p>
                <p>One of the other issues we dealt with was whether to include aircraft. Our basic
                    point was that aircraft were not as threatening. I am not saying that they were
                    unthreatening, but not as threatening as the missiles, and that we really needed
                    to concentrate on the missiles. In addition to this point, the Soviets continued
                    to argue that we had more aircraft than they did. We'd been rather defensive
                    about the aircraft position, and, as the debate wore on, I suggested that we
                    might go over to the offensive. By our account, the Soviets had far more INF
                    range aircraft than the U.S. and NATO. We might suggest to the Soviets, that
                    while we continue to consider missiles more worthy of priority attention, we
                    were quite prepared to consider reductions in aircraft and then confront them
                    with the quantitative asymmetry. The U.S. Air Force had some qualms about this
                    approach, but when they ran the numbers and saw how we could argue in good
                    conscience that the Soviet INF range aircraft outnumber ours, they took up the
                    challenge.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>Among the aircraft that the Soviets sought to exclude was their new Fencer. They
                    argued this aircraft could not fly a 1,000 kilometer round trip mission. At the
                    same time they insisted that older U.S. aircraft could undertake such a mission.
                    When we probed the Soviets how they could have come to such conclusion, the
                    discussion turned into a question of flight profiles. Aircraft use less fuel
                    when flying at high altitudes but at lower altitudes, where the air is denser
                    and offers more resistance, they use more fuel. It was generally understood that
                    most aircraft would take off low, fly high towards the target, drop down under
                    the radar to deliver their weapons, exit the target area, and then fly back to
                    base at higher altitudes. The Soviets claimed that their flight profile called
                    for flying low to and from the target. As a result their range was limited. When
                    we asked them why their aircraft had to fly such a flight profile while our
                    aircraft could fly a more efficient and effective flight pattern, they replied
                    that our airplanes had technical advantages over theirs.</p>
                <p>For the Soviets to make such an argument was most unusual. The fact that they
                    used it is an indication of the importance they placed on being able to protect
                    their claim that NATO had an advantage in aircraft, even if it meant
                    acknowledging the superiority of U.S. equipment. We continued to hammer away at
                    this chink in their armor. In any event, the seeds were planted which would
                    eventually lead both sides to agree to drop aircraft from the INF treaty
                    regime.</p>
                <p>Despite or maybe because of the inability of both sides so early in the
                    negotiations to move off their opening position, the verbal jousting during the
                    post-plenary sessions continued at a brisk pace. In preparing for my job, as
                    deputy chief U.S. negotiator, I read a number of articles about Soviet and
                    Russian negotiating tactics. Some of these were provided by my European NATO
                    colleagues, thus giving me more than one slant on this topic. In addition, my
                    previous work in the international trade arena had exposed me to a wide variety
                    of national and individual negotiating approaches. Among the frequently
                    mentioned ploys, the desire to get the last word, and the device of putting your
                    words into an interlocutor's mouth, and vice versa, seemed to have been
                    particularly well learned by our Soviet counterparts.</p>
                <p>After our first two post-plenary meetings, I pointed out to Nitze that Kvitsinsky
                    seemed especially to favor these two old standards. As our next meeting drew to
                    a close, he was at it again. Nitze, however, got the best of him by saying,
                    “Well, Mike, he really has to have the last word so let's give it to him and get
                    out of here.” Which we proceeded to do. At the next post-plenary meeting,
                    Kvitsinsky, indirectly referring to the tale of the rabbit and the bear,
                    suggested that in approaching the negotiation we should go beyond good and evil.
                    I said, “That judgment comes from Nietzsche and you know what had that lead to.”
                    “Yes, I do,” said Kvitsinsky. “Nietzsche lead to Wagner. Wagner, I said, “gave
                    us the Gotterdammerung.” Soon thereafter, as the meeting seemed about to enter
                    into the last word jockeying phase, Kvitsinsky turned to General Detinov and
                    said, “Well, Nikolai, Glitman always has to have the last word, so let's give it
                    to him and leave.” Later in the negotiations, the Soviet ploys took on a
                    counterproductive and perhaps sinister aspect adversely impacting efforts to
                    find a common ground.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>In addition to the major issues involving the longer range INF systems, there
                    were several other issues which were of special importance. We were beginning to
                    see them and recognize that we would have to resolve them. One was the treatment
                    of shorter range systems. These would be systems with ranges below 1,000
                    kilometers. NATO had originally proposed that these systems be dealt with under
                    some form of “collateral constraints,” but it wasn't spelled out. But somehow or
                    other, they would not be allowed to run totally free when we would put a ban on
                    the production and holdings of the longer range INF missiles which went from
                    1,000 to 5,500 kilometers in range. We proposed to limit certain of these
                    shorter range systems. The Soviets argued that short of eliminating all
                    non-strategic nuclear forces from Europe, systems with ranges below 1,000
                    kilometer should not be constrained. Needless to say, they had quite a large
                    numerical advantage in those as well. That was one question, we referred to it
                    as SRINF, short range INF, and it was one issue we knew we would have to address
                    as the negotiations proceeded.</p>
                <p>Another one involved the method of reduction. We favored destruction; the Soviets
                    had a combination of destruction and some withdrawal. And then there was the
                    question of the duration of an agreement. It was clear we were going to have
                    some differences of view on this issue. We saw the treaty lasting with unlimited
                    duration, and the initial Soviet approach had the treaty lasting till 1990.
                    Which was obviously a very short term agreement.</p>
                <p>While we had not gotten very far into verification, it also became obvious pretty
                    early that we were going to have difficulties in reaching agreement on
                    verification. The Soviets were leery of too much on-site close inspection, and
                    we were moving in the direction of wanting to have as rigorous and stringent an
                    inspection process as possible, compatible with our own need for a certain
                    amount of secrecy. That too was clearly on the agenda as we moved into later
                    stages of the negotiation.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>We should also bear in mind that during this period, at the beginning of the
                    negotiations, the public interest had grown considerably, and this interest
                    began to take form in larger and larger demonstrations against nuclear weapon
                    policies. Something like a 100,000 in Hamburg, Schmidt's hometown, rallied
                    against nuclear weapon policies, on June 20, 1981. The coming months would see
                    more such demonstrations. There were four days of peace rallies in East Germany,
                    attended by 480,000 in April 1982. In June, there were crowds of approximately
                    15,000 in Paris, 300,000 in Rome, and 115,000 in London. This was all in 1982.
                    There were over 300,000 demonstrating in Bonn in April 1982. Even in New York,
                    something like 800,000 demonstrated in support of the nuclear freeze movement.
                    And I might note that while primarily aimed at the U.S. strategic nuclear force,
                    the nuclear freeze movement approach to the new deployments fit perfectly with
                    the one-sided Soviet INF moratorium proposal and would have undercut NATO's dual
                    track decision. And there was a freeze movement in the U.S. as well as abroad.
                    On August 5th, the U.S. House of Representatives failed by two votes to pass a
                    resolution in support of an immediate freeze on production, deployment, and
                    testing of nuclear weapons. In October, over 20,000 demonstrated in Ottawa
                    against Canadian agreement to approve testing of U.S. cruise missiles in
                    Alberta. Again, a lot of this activity was supported and aided by the Soviets.
                    It was a clear-cut effort to influence publics, and through them, governments
                    to, in effect, accept the Soviet position in the INF negotiations to essentially
                    not deploy anything on the NATO side and to leave the Soviet Union with an
                    enormous superiority in these type of systems. We had our work cut out for us.
                    We know now that Soviets were actively working with these groups. Essentially,
                    as we'll see later, the Soviets put too much faith in those groups' ability to
                    swing governments and publics. It was becoming obvious that the outcome of the
                    negotiations would depend on the ability of the European NATO governments and
                    the U.S. government to maintain public support for the dual track decision.</p>
                <p>The negotiations themselves were about to settle down into a campaign of maneuver
                    with each party introducing variations on their basic theme and working to show
                    that they were being flexible. But there would be no give on the fundamental
                    differences. The Soviet proposals, no matter how they were dressed up, all led
                    to the same conclusion, i.e., that there would be no deployments of U.S. INF in
                    Europe while the Soviets would retain a substantial portion of their new SS-20
                    force. During the second round, which went from May to July 1982, the Soviets
                    tabled a draft treaty based on their proposal that both NATO and the USSR would
                    reduce their medium range systems to 300. NATO's 300 would consist of U.K. and
                    French forces, with only a small number of U.S. aircraft in the mix and no new
                    type on INF missiles would be allowed. Restrictions would not apply to the
                    Soviet forces in the Far East, although SS-20s east of the Urals were quite
                    capable of reaching targets in NATO Europe. Ground and sea launched cruise
                    missiles would be banned regardless of location. Of course we were producing new
                    systems of that sort as well and Soviets were behind in that field. The Soviets
                    did agree that the treaty could be of unlimited duration, specified a zone of
                    withdrawal, and agreed that Soviet INF systems west of 80 degrees of longitude
                    would be subject to limitations. They also suggested that systems with ranges
                    below 1,000 kilometers could be covered in side protocols. There they begin to
                    make some move towards capturing SRINF.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>While these proposals made minor adjustments in the Soviet positions, they didn't
                    change the fundamentals. It would lead to an unequal outcome, exclude any U.S.
                    INF missile deployments, and allow the Soviets to deploy an INF force which
                    would equal the number of all U.K. and French INF systems, but would not limit
                    Soviet strategic forces which could also target the U.K. and France. For its
                    part, the U.S. worked on the basis of making progress where it could be made,
                    while continuing to explain its position and to explain the weaknesses of the
                    Soviet proposals. The U.S. tried to get the Soviets to agree to set up some
                    working groups on technical issues. One of them was a data experts group, which
                    would consider date and try to reduce the differences of the data of the sides
                    on such issues as the number of existing systems and their capabilities. Another
                    was a treaty text working group, which would begin to blend together language of
                    the two draft treaties in those non-controversial areas, based on “boiler-plate”
                    language, where they were already quite close.</p>
                <p>It was against a background of not much progress at all in the negotiations;
                    indeed, where the progress that was made was a secondary issue; that the
                    political situation in West Germany began to grow increasingly tense with the
                    demonstrations both reflecting and helping create a climate of angst. Nitze and
                    I had visited FM Minister Genscher and his arms control and security staff in
                    Bonn, and Chancellor Schmidt in Hamburg in mid-April, between the first and
                    second rounds. It was a few days after a major peace rally which attracted
                    480,000. We came away from our meetings feeling that the German leadership would
                    stand by the 1979 decision and carry out the deployments. Both of us were
                    concerned, however, that the end result might well resemble a pyrrhic victory,
                    with considerable damage inflicted upon the Alliance as a result of disaffection
                    of a large portion of the public of several alliance member states. As the end
                    of the second negotiating round came into view, Nitze became increasingly
                    concerned over the situation in Germany. With these concerns in mind, and with
                    word from Kvitsinsky that Moscow would be holding a major review of the
                    negotiations during the summer break, he discussed with me and others his belief
                    that the U.S. would need to cut through the morass of issues and try to find the
                    basis for a deal. He concluded that the U.S. was unlikely to achieve an
                    agreement involving substantial movement on the Soviet side unless we were
                    prepared for a substantial movement on our side. These observations are taken,
                    in part from my memories of the time, and from Nitze's book From Hiroshima to
                    Glasnost.</p>
                <p>I shared his concern and his belief that the U.S. would need to make some changes
                    to its position. The zero-zero proposal remained an excellent bedrock upon which
                    to base our position, but the Soviets, by putting forth variant after variant of
                    their basic unequal outcome proposal, had created the appearance but not the
                    reality of flexibility. In my view, what the U.S. needed was to offer an equal
                    outcome at some number other than zero. While retaining zero as our preferred
                    outcome. In other words, we needed an interim proposal which would show movement
                    on our part without abandoning our principled approach.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>More fundamentally, although I was very much in favor of trying out variations of
                    our own in order to demonstrate flexibility, I was persuaded that the Soviets
                    would not agree to any outcome other than their unequal no-U.S. deployment
                    proposals before the U.S. had deployed its new INF missiles in Europe. To do
                    otherwise would be to give up on their possibilities of overturning the 1979
                    NATO decision and splitting the Alliance wide open. There would be no serious
                    movement on the core question of an equal outcome from the Soviet side until
                    NATO had demonstrated the will and the ability to deploy. In the meantime, the
                    Soviets would rely on their negotiating and public relations skills and on the
                    political impact of the anti-nuclear demonstrations on NATO governments to help
                    fashion a favorable outcome. We now know that the Soviet negotiators'
                    instructions were indeed “mainly to prevent American INF deployments.” And this
                    quote is taken from the book called The Big Five: Arms Control Decision Making
                    in the Soviet Union, and the authors were Aleksand'r G. Savel'yev and General
                    Nikolay N. Detinov, my counterpart during these negotiations. In any case, we
                    would need to use our skills to prevent either an outcome which would prevent
                    our deployment or one which would yield a pyrrhic victory. Without revealing
                    that he was considering going soon to Kvitsinsky with his concept, Nitze
                    outlined parts of what would become his “Walk-in-the-Woods” formula to me. Its
                    main feature was an equal outcome at a number above zero with the U.S. deploying
                    only cruise missiles. While we would drop the Pershing-2, obtaining Soviet
                    agreement to the deployment of the cruise missiles to NATO Europe, would meet
                    our political and military requirements. Moreover, I believed that even if
                    Soviets would not accept any U.S. deployment, the U.S. proposal was imaginative.
                    Its eventual move into the public arena would help us and allied governments in
                    what would become a very important struggle for public support in NATO
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>Two days before Nitze and Kvitsinsky took their walk in the woods, Chris and I
                    attended a dinner hosted by Norm Clyne and his wife Alice. Nitze, Kvitsinsky,
                    and their wives were among the other invitees. After dinner, Kvitsinsky and I
                    had a serious—and for his part gloomy—conversation. After going over our
                    respective views of the state of the talks, Kvitsinsky said that he thought the
                    negotiations were heading towards an impasse and that he could see no way out.
                    When I commented that we needed to recognize that the talks were likely to go on
                    for some time, and that what seemed impossible today might be possible tomorrow,
                    Kvitsinsky said he thought hopeful circumstance was unlikely. “In the end, you
                    will deploy and we will walk out in indignation.” Thirty-six hours later, he
                    would walk with Nitze down a path in the Jura.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>The round ended soon after the walk in the woods. Nitze had arranged that he and
                    Kvitsinsky would keep in touch while both were in their respective capitals via
                    a special point of contact in the Soviet Embassy at Washington. As the summer
                    went by without a word from Kvitsinsky, opposition to the concept begin to grow
                    within the U.S. administration. The stated concern was that the Soviets would
                    reject the overall approach but then pocket those aspects of it which they liked
                    as concessions that the USG, the United States Government, had made to the USSR.
                    The opponents to Nitze's approach considered that allowing the Soviets to retain
                    ballistic missiles, while limiting the U.S. to less capable cruise missiles, was
                    in effect an unequal qualitative outcome, regardless of the numerical equality.
                    However, it was agreed that if the subject came up when Nitze met with
                    Kvitsinsky in Geneva, or Secretary of State Shultz met with Soviet Foreign
                    Minister Gromyko, Nitze and Shultz would say that the U.S. had examined the
                    package and considered it to be unequal, because the U.S. was not permitted to
                    have in Europe any missile comparable to the SS-20, it was allowed only slow
                    flying cruise missiles. Nitze and Shultz would note that the U.S. also took
                    exception to that part of the walk-in-the-woods formula which allowed the
                    Soviets to retain 90 SS-20s in the eastern USSR, which could reach, or be moved
                    into range of targets in NATO Europe. The U.S. was however, prepared to continue
                    to exchanges in the Nitze-Kvitsinsky channel.</p>
                <p>Nitze carried out his instructions during his meeting with Kvitsinsky on
                    September 29, 1982—the eve of the formal opening of Round Three. Kvitsinsky in
                    turn gave Nitze a short paper which reiterated the main lines of the Soviet
                    position. Full compensation for U.K. and French nuclear forces, no U.S.
                    deployments, no constraints on Soviet INF systems east of the Urals, major
                    reductions in dual capable aircraft, including those on U.S. aircraft carriers,
                    and full adherence to the concept of equality and equal security; this latter
                    point was a Soviet formulation which sought to provide a philosophical
                    foundation for inequality. Finally, Kvitsinsky told Nitze he would not continue
                    discussions with Nitze in his channel. Moscow had turned down both the substance
                    of what Kvitsinsky and Nitze had agreed to present to their capitals, as well as
                    the informal channel that gave birth to the proposal. Unfortunately, when
                    inevitably the episode leaked, the media portrayed the issue largely in personal
                    terms, placing emphasis on internecine bureaucratic warfare in Washington. The
                    result was to the give the public the impression that it was Washington's
                    reaction, not Moscow's, that was mainly responsible for the failure of the walk
                    in the woods. We asked our selves why did Kvitsinsky continue the discussion
                    during the walk with Nitze, even after Nitze said there would be no point in
                    continuing the conversation if Kvitsinsky had no flexibility on third country
                    systems. Nitze did make that point. Why did he take the first step down that
                    path, despite his having forecast, correctly as it turned out, that this phase
                    of the negotiations would end with the U.S. deploying and the Soviets walking
                    out? Neither Nitze nor I asked him. The whole episode left a bad taste in
                    everyone's mouth, and there was little interest in pursuing motivations in a
                    failed attempt.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>The round would continue and we would try to make progress towards convergence in
                    some of the secondary areas where both sides had similar positions. But the
                    Soviets held back, arguing essentially that no progress could be made unless the
                    U.S. accepted their basic approach to an agreement. And they began to introduce
                    obstacles to progress, refusing to enter technical discussions to support their
                    assertions on missile and aircraft ranges. They put in some basic new proposals,
                    which were in effect additional variants of their unequal outcome approach. They
                    would have allowed no U.S. deployments to match Soviet missiles, once again
                    ignoring Soviet strategic missiles and virtually eliminating U.S. nuclear
                    capable aircraft. The Soviets also stepped up their threats of countermeasure
                    should NATO proceed with the deployment of U.S. INF missiles. And again, they
                    hinted at new deployments of their own and of walking out of the
                    negotiations.</p>
                <p>It's obvious that Soviets were both seeking to give the impression of a stalemate
                    and creating the reality of one. It's also obvious, as I had believed from the
                    outset, that their real target audience was not their negotiating partners, but
                    rather the European and to some extend the U.S. public. The number and size of
                    anti-deployment demonstrations was attracting wide media attention. The
                    impression was being given of an unstoppable movement. The Future of the North
                    Atlantic Alliance and the course of the Cold War would be determined by how well
                    NATO would respond to this challenge.</p>
                <p>While I had had some indirect contact with the peace movement in Europe, my first
                    real contact with the U.S. peace movement occurred in Vermont. We were on home
                    leave from assignment at NATO, it was 1981, when Chris pointed out an article in
                    the Burlington Free Press, that a group of local peace activists were going to
                    hold an anti-nuclear rally which featured a walk from Washington to Moscow, both
                    in this instance being small towns in Vermont. They invited speakers from both
                    the U.S. Department of State and from the Soviet Embassy in Washington. The
                    Embassy agreed to send someone, but the State Department, short of funds as
                    ever, had declined. Chris said the U.S. government ought not to appear afraid to
                    take on a challenge. I agreed and after checking with the department called the
                    organizers and offered to speak. I had, of course, been working on both the
                    deployment of U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe and the proposal to negotiate
                    limitations on those weapons. I believed that the U.S. and its allies had a
                    logical and sound position. I had put this position to Europeans and was
                    prepared to propound it before an American audience. Chris and some of our
                    children accompanied me to the outdoor rally in Washington, Vermont. There was a
                    fairly large crowd by Vermont standards. It appeared from the banners and
                    placards and comments of the speakers that all were of one mind—opposing the
                    very idea of nuclear deterrence, supporting a nuclear freeze, and willing to see
                    the U.S. and the Soviet Union as equivalent states.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>My talk was designed to lay out an alternative proposition, based on the premise
                    that the Reagan administration was serious about providing a strong defense and
                    achieving negotiated reductions in U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons. It was among
                    the first of many such efforts to persuade the peace movement that the U.S. was
                    determined to enhance its security and NATO's security by deploying new weapons,
                    negotiating sound and durable arms control agreement, or creating a combination
                    of the two. I argued that the “Better red than dead” slogan was based on a
                    faulty juxtaposition of alternatives. The talk emphasized that with the proper
                    blend of defense and arms control policies, we could continue to enjoy both our
                    freedoms and avoid nuclear war. To underscore that there was no equivalency
                    between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, I pointed out that one need not be
                    believer in international conspiracy theory to recognize that the Soviet Union
                    is a totalitarian state. Just look at its historical record—or at least a map—to
                    see a pattern for concern. Recall Afghanistan, Czechoslovakia, Hungary. Be aware
                    of its use of military power to intimidate and question the policies of a regime
                    which forces distinguished intellectual and artistic leaders into exile or
                    worse—refuse to let others leave.</p>
                <p>Then to underscore our willingness to negotiate, my talk continued by stressing
                    that this litany does not lead to the conclusion that we should have no contact
                    with the Soviets. Instead I concluded, we must and should seek agreements with
                    them. The only way to achieve successful arms control and reduction agreements
                    was through a long slog of complex, extensive, and intensive negotiations backed
                    by the will to be armed. In order to demonstrate that the U.S. administration
                    was far from being isolated in this approach, I cited statements by
                    left-of-center European leaders and others recognizing that a freeze would leave
                    the U.S. at a dangerous disadvantage, especially given the continuing Soviet
                    buildup and understanding that the Soviets would never negotiate with us unless
                    we had missiles of our own. “When the seriousness of our intent becomes clear to
                    the Soviets,” I said, “they will tire of proposals such as those which seek to
                    freeze NATO's modernization program, before it has begun, while reserving for
                    themselves the advantages of hundreds of deployed SS-20s. They will recognize
                    that what is required in our mutual interest is a serious negotiation, not
                    efforts to achieve one-sided advantage.” I was to return to many of these themes
                    throughout the next several years.</p>
                <p>However, while I was still only partly trough my speech, some in the audience
                    began shaking their placards and shouting “We've heard enough, let's start
                    marching!” I particularly noted the proverbial energized gray-haired woman in
                    sneakers. One of the event organizers whispered to me, “Wrap it up.” I quickly
                    reminded them that they had asked me to speak for 20 minutes and I had prepared
                    my remarks accordingly. At that point a voice called out to “Let the man
                    finish.” And the crowd quieted down until I had finished. The voice it turned
                    out was that of my son Erik —and without prompting from his mother. Afterwards,
                    a few of the audience paid me a backhanded compliment, congratulating me on
                    doing an excellent job defending a bad policy. I would see the placard shaking
                    woman again, several years later, under very different circumstances.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>The Burlington Free Press, in reporting on the event, stressed that both the
                    Soviet speaker, who gave his talk in Moscow, Vermont, and I were cut from the
                    same mold, wearing similar clothing and arguing our cases in a similar manner.
                    It was a phenomenon I would encounter again. Unfortunately, an effort to bend
                    over backwards to appear even-handed, sometimes ended with the appearance of
                    establishing moral equivalency between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. There was
                    no chance that the Soviet media or peace organizations would reciprocate. The
                    event was my first encounter with the American peace movement. The fervor and
                    the evident unwillingness of some of the group to hear or even allow some others
                    to hear differing opinion made a deep impression. It appeared the struggle for
                    public opinion would take place on three fronts: countering the Soviet
                    propaganda directly; seeking the support of the European publics—NATO publics;
                    and maintaining the support of the American public. I passed my observations to
                    colleagues in Washington, many of whom had not been aware of the extent to which
                    the home-grown version of the European peace movement had developed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are going to continue with Intermediate Range Nuclear
                        Force Negotiations in Geneva, during the time frame 1981-1984. We will take
                        up after the failed walk in the woods.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: The nature of the failure of the walk in the woods, particularly the
                    clear sign that the Soviets would not agree to any approach which would have
                    permitted U.S. deployments, or one which would result in an equal outcome
                    between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., really reinforced my view that no agreement
                    could be reached until we had U.S. INF missiles on the ground in Europe. At the
                    same time, we were determined to negotiate seriously and to be seen doing so.
                    When the third round began, on September 30, 1982, the U.S. delegation continued
                    with the effort to persuade the Soviets to at least acknowledge that NATO had
                    legitimate security concerns as a result of the Soviet INF deployments and to
                    recognize that the U.S. was prepared to work out an agreement that met both
                    sides' concerns. We also continued to seek to make progress in those areas where
                    the positions of the sides that had begun to converge, where common language had
                    been agreed in earlier negotiations, or where the sides could move ahead even if
                    they remained deadlocked on key issues. The Soviets, unfortunately, were not
                    really ready for this type of negotiation or to move in that direction.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>During this period, the Soviets came up with quite a few seemingly new
                    approaches, new proposals, but it was blatantly apparent to those of us engaged
                    in the negotiations that these were not new, but all variations on a theme. And
                    that theme was essentially that the U.K. and French forces balanced the Soviet
                    forces, and, therefore, there was no room for the U.S. to have any forces in
                    Europe. It was again the proposal for an unequal outcome between the U.S. and
                    the Soviet Union. And it was doubly unequal because the Soviet Union not only
                    had SS-20s to counter British and French forces, it had its entire strategic
                    force in addition to SS-20s, which could play that role. But, the Soviets were
                    quite clever in the way they managed to portray these proposals as new
                    positions. We were, in a way, frustrated. I remember going to several of the SCG
                    meetings during this period and on one occasion I pointed out that it seemed
                    that all of the Soviet proposals could fit on a t-shirt. They were easily turned
                    into a slogan: “Freeze now.” Our reactions, our proposals, and our criticisms of
                    their proposals were correct; but they were also much longer. They were much
                    more thorough perhaps, but the net result was that the Soviets had a clear
                    propaganda advantage over us.</p>
                <p>This led me to begin considering also whether we needed to move towards a more
                    flexible position, putting out some new concepts. The problem here was somewhat
                    political. President Reagan had formally proposed a zero result, that is, no INF
                    missiles for either the U.S. or the Soviet Union. And that was our established
                    position. But it seemed to me that we ought to be able to say, “We will take a
                    lower number, although zero remains our preference.” In other words, if we don't
                    get zero, it would be because the Soviets were not prepared to go that far, but
                    that was our preferred outcome. We were prepared to consider an equal number,
                    somewhere below the total of 572 missiles which we planed to deploy. It took a
                    little while to persuade everyone in Washington we needed to do that. But
                    eventually, it did become our position and, at that point, we were also able,
                    therefore, to show some flexibility. Not a rigid demand for zero, rather a
                    preference for zero but willingness to consider other equal numbers, as long as
                    they were below the 572 number which was the number of our planned deployments.
                    Again, the stress was on equality between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>While we were not able to make as much progress as we wanted to during this
                    period, there were some other areas where we seemed to get a little closer to
                    the Soviets. One of these was on short range INF missiles. Again, during this
                    period in late 1982, in the fall of 1982, they proposed constraints that would
                    be quantitative in nature and apply only to the missiles between ranges between
                    500 and 1,000 kilometers. That was within our concept as well. We did want
                    collateral constraints. The Soviets also began to move in a familiar direction;
                    when we got into their proposals, they frequently ended with a freeze proposal.
                    Of course, a freeze in the SRINF would leave us with zero and the Soviets with
                    hundreds. So we made the point that this result would be a totally unequal
                    outcome and not acceptable.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>As a result of our responding to their really unequal outcomes, we began
                    imperceptibly to move away from a general concept of some kind of collateral
                    constraints to a conclusion that we had to have an equal outcome in SRINF as we
                    had insisted on in INF. That happened virtually imperceptibly to us. Only when I
                    went back and looked at it years later did I see what had happened. I might say,
                    to the best of my recollection, the Soviets never called us on that, that we had
                    sort of shifted our position from collateral constraints not otherwise defined
                    to equality not only in long range INF but also in SRINF. At the same time, they
                    included in their 500-1,000 kilometer range, the SS-12-22 missiles that they had
                    and the Pershing Is which we had and some of which were in the hands of the
                    Germans. We will come to that issue later; it would become a major issue. But
                    they continued to deny the very existence of the SS-23, and that missile we will
                    hear about as well in the future as we go through this account.</p>
                <p>There were also other proposals that the Soviets came up with during this period.
                    One was a sub-ceiling for missiles; we had a ceiling for aircraft and a ceiling
                    for missiles. While it appeared that the sub-ceiling would be set at the level
                    of the U.K. and French forces, it did represent an acknowledgment that the
                    aircraft and missiles should not be treated as equally potent weapons, but the
                    overall result of this proposal was to leave intact the basic Soviet unequal
                    outcome approach. In addition to these sorts of carrots and efforts to appear
                    flexible, the Soviets often had other proposals, and some of them looked rather
                    enticing on the surface. Brezhnev announced a unilateral freeze on SS-20
                    deployments, but that announcement proved short-lived and they moved off of it.
                    When we examined these proposals, they all remained rooted in the fundamental
                    Soviet unequal outcome. No U.S. deployments and the equation of Soviet INF with
                    U.K. and French forces; that was the basic aspect of their position, and it
                    didn't change. As I said, I referred to these as variations on a theme. For some
                    reason, Kvitsinsky didn't like that phrase. I guess the word in Russian is
                    “variant” and it seems to have a pejorative sense, which it doesn't carry in
                    English. But nonetheless, those were variations on a theme and not anything
                    really new. As I said, these continued adjustments gave the impression of Soviet
                    movement and flexibility. But I did begin an effort to try to move us to a
                    different position; as I pointed out earlier, zero was our preferred outcome but
                    we would be willing to consider other alternatives.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>Finally, while the Soviets had been offering all these alternatives, they also
                    began brandishing some sticks, as well as carrots. And there was a notable
                    increase in the threat of countermeasures which would follow any U.S.
                    deployment. These statements were clearly designed to frighten European publics.
                    The SCG prepared a document called the “SCG Progress Report” which came out
                    about the time of the deployments. And it summed up, I felt very clearly, our
                    own, the U.S. INF delegation view on the status of the negotiations at the end
                    of this post walk-in-the-woods round in September 1982. It increasingly became
                    apparent that the Soviet effort in Geneva was aimed to a significant extent, if
                    not primarily, at public opinion. The Soviets tabled several variations of the
                    same proposal, all of which would have had the same essential outcomes,
                    apparently to position themselves to claim that they had shown flexibility and
                    had offered a range of solutions to the INF problem. At the same time, they
                    increasingly stymied progress on the smallest of issues, in an effort to create
                    the appearance of a negotiating dead lock, the blame for which they attempted to
                    place on the U.S. Their calculation undoubtedly was that such a stalemated
                    negotiation would generate pressure for U.S. concessions and against proceeding
                    with deployments as scheduled. This was published, as I said, by NATO and this
                    judgment represented the view not just of the U.S. but of all the allies on the
                    status of the negotiations at this point.</p>
                <p>This might be a good time to try to restate somewhat more clearly the basic point
                    that I made earlier about my sense that we needed to move off of the zero
                    approach and to consider some alternatives, which would maintain our fundamental
                    principles but give us the ability to show some flexibility. I wasn't alone;
                    most of us on the delegation were somewhat frustrated by the situation because
                    we could see that the Soviets were scoring propaganda points by the variations
                    on their themes. The reaction in Europe was that the Soviets were being
                    flexible. We would shoot them down one by one, but that response still didn't
                    detract from the view that we were somewhat on the defensive.</p>
                <p>There are times in negotiation when one must stand firmly on a position. And
                    there are elements of a position which one cannot abandon or compromise without
                    undermining the fundamental premise of one's approach to negotiation. There are
                    times in negotiation when one can and must demonstrate flexibility by offering
                    alternatives which would not breech the fundamental premises of ones approach to
                    negotiations. We should take that approach in order to avoid creating a
                    situation outside the negotiations which could prove more harmful to our
                    interests than a demonstration of flexibility might engender. There are times
                    when one needs to make some changes in the fundamental position in order to come
                    to closure on an outcome which despite the change of position is still basically
                    favorable to one's interest. I believed even before this round ended that we'd
                    reached such a point.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>We had held firmly to the equal-zero approach for a year. It was a strong
                    position and served to underscore the desire of the U.S. and NATO to pursue the
                    ultimate arms control outcome for these negotiations. But the Soviets were
                    proving adapt at making frequent, seemingly major, shifts and concessions. We
                    were equally adept at proving these moves were smoke and mirrors and represented
                    no change in the basic Soviet position. Nevertheless, the dynamics of the
                    exchange placed us on the defensive. I believed strongly that we needed to show
                    that we too can propose a change in our basic position. Moreover, Western
                    European political leaders were beginning to suggest that it was becoming time
                    for the U.S. to negotiate a new move of its own.</p>
                <p>As I said, I'd been considering the benefits of offering an interim alternative
                    for some time. Nitze had in effect a proposed one in the walk-in-the-woods
                    formula. While I did not believe that the Soviets would accept any outcome that
                    we might accept, until NATO had demonstrated it could deploy, we would need to
                    take an initiative if we were to hold our own in the public arena. But the
                    initiative need not, indeed ought not, to compromise our basic position of an
                    equal outcome— in this case formulated as equal in both qualitative and
                    quantitative terms. The change could be rather simple. We would continue to
                    express a strong preference for double zero. Now, because of the Soviet
                    unwillingness to go that far, we would propose any number below 572. As I said,
                    that was the number of U.S. LRINF scheduled to be deployed in Europe. Delegation
                    members collectively and individually carried this concept back to Washington
                    after the end of this round on November 30, 1982.</p>
                <p>We also had our traditional end-of-round party. As I've said, there was a sense
                    frustration of among the members of the delegation—a feeling that the
                    negotiations were treading water at best— and that the Soviets were scoring
                    their propaganda points by their disingenuous policy. The skits and the parodies
                    reflected this attitude. Chris and I did one as well. Chris played Nitze, while
                    I played Kvitsinsky. To the tune of “Let's take an old fashioned walk” we
                    sang:</p>
                <p>I'll say the idea came from you. You say the concept was mine. Maybe we'll both
                    end up in the stew. If you get burned, that's just fine.</p>
                <p>Let's take an old fashioned walk. I'm just bursting with talk. What a tale could
                    be told. If we both took an old fashioned walk.</p>
                <p>Kvitsinsky got the last word in this exchange.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>When we finally got back to Washington, there was, as expected, resistance to
                    moving off an exclusive zero option approach. The opposition to a change was
                    based in part on the grounds that it was not what the president wanted and this
                    view was accompanied by the implication that any deviation would be disloyal.
                    Some argued that the situation was, in fact, well in hand, and we did not need
                    to make any moves. In the end, the agreement was reached that the U.S. position
                    would remain based on the double zero outcome. However, we would be authorized
                    to say that while it was our preferred solution, and surely the best for all
                    concerned, we were prepared to consider alternate outcomes at numbers above zero
                    but below 572. So from here on, we were able to come back and show some
                    flexibility on our part. And I am confident it helped us in our public relations
                    as well as the internal USG back-and-forth within the negotiations.</p>
                <p>The next round began on January 26, 1983. That was Round Four. We actually put
                    this proposal out. We also, in saying that we were ready to consider reasonable
                    alternatives, set up five criteria based, as was our position, essentially on
                    the 1979 NATO decision, by which we would judge any proposed outcome. First, an
                    agreement must entail equal rights and limits between the U.S. and the USSR.
                    Second, an agreement should address only the systems of the U.S. and the USSR.
                    Third, an agreement should apply limits to INF systems, regardless of location
                    and should not result in an exportation of a security problem in Europe to the
                    Far East. This was a way of letting our Japanese and Korean allies know that we
                    were not going to see this situation put them—as the outcome of the
                    negotiation—in a worse security situation, but preferably in a better one.
                    Fourth, an agreement should not weaken the U.S. contribution to NATO's
                    conventional deterrence and defense. (A side note on that: this was to make sure
                    that we let the Soviets know that we were not going to countenance an agreement
                    that impacted on our conventional aircraft, in their effort to get the nuclear
                    warheads out of the way.) And finally, an agreement must be verifiable. The five
                    points covered the key issues for the U.S., and they all essentially harkened
                    back to the 1979 NATO decision, so we kept in sync with our allies on these
                    points.</p>
                <p>The Soviets chose not to take up our offer to explore the possibility of reaching
                    an agreement at an equal number above zero. Rather, they continued to offer
                    their variations on the principal theme of an outcome at which the Soviet INF
                    systems would be set at a level that would match U.K. and French forces. They
                    made clear that if the U.K. and/or France should increase the quality or
                    quantity of their forces, the Soviets would be authorized to increase their
                    LRINF systems in Europe. We expressed a wonderment at how the Soviets could
                    expect the U.S. to participate in such an agreement with them and why the U.K.
                    and France would approve such a scheme. They repeated their positions,
                    occasionally citing the Russian proverb that repetition is the mother of
                    learning. If so, we proved to be unwilling students.</p>

                <p>This unproductive round ground on and, perhaps buoyed by the continued
                    anti-nuclear demonstrations, the Soviets in fact displayed even more
                    intransigence and brought to a halt productive work on secondary issues. They
                    also set out their own prerequisites for the main issues. First, an agreement
                    could not entail deployment of U.S. missiles in Europe. In other words, we
                    couldn't deploy. Second, negotiations must address only the most urgent and
                    acute problems of the situation in Europe. Third, negotiations should encompass
                    all types of medium range systems, land and sea-based aircraft, as well as
                    missiles. Fourth, negotiations must take into account British and French
                    forces.</p>
                <p>The first one was of course the basic Soviet demand, it essentially claimed that
                    the U.S./NATO position was illegitimate and provided no grounds for
                    negotiations. The second sought to leave SS-20s in the eastern portion of the
                    Soviet Union free from any limitations and free to attack and intimidate NATO
                    Europe because they had the range to do it. Point three sought to use the INF
                    negotiations to eviscerate U.S. conventional aviation in Europe. Point four
                    seemed to provide a rational for an unequal outcome in which there would be no
                    U.S. deployments in Europe and the U.K. and France would find their entire
                    nuclear force equated with only a small portion of the overall Soviet nuclear
                    arsenal. That's why we had to go back, just as I did now, point by point, with
                    the Soviets. We were using the same points outside the negotiations, setting out
                    the Soviet position and showing where the flaws were in it.</p>
                <p>We were always somewhat on a defensive when we had to do this because we would be
                    coming, in this case, at a “new” proposal on their part which turned out not to
                    be so new in reality. We did, as this round drew to a close on March 29, 1983,
                    formally table our interim proposal. And in doing so, we established for all to
                    see that the U.S. and its NATO allies were willing to modify a major element of
                    our initial position: the zero outcome. While the Soviets and the Western
                    opponents of the deployment downplayed the move, they could not deny that the
                    U.S. had shown flexibility. That did not, however, deflect the 500,000 marchers
                    who turned out for an anti-deployment demonstration in West Germany a few days
                    after the round had ended.</p>
                <p>On the other hand—and this was a major development—the right-of-center
                    pro-deployment Christian Democratic Union under Helmut Kohl, had defeated the
                    increasingly anti-deployment left-of-center Social Democrats in elections held
                    on March 30. With a prospect of the Bundestag majority in favor of deployments,
                    the real political situation had in fact improved for NATO and the U.S.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>We returned to Geneva on May 17, 1983, for Round Five. Our delegation had tabled
                    a new draft treaty based on this interim approach. In other words, we wouldn't
                    go to zero immediately, but we'd have this other number with zero as a preferred
                    outcome and, hopefully down the line, the final outcome. The Soviets, perhaps
                    still pumped up by the continued demonstrations and clearly not mindful of the
                    changed political situation in the Bundestag, refused to participate in the
                    process effectively. We were determined to press ahead and to make progress
                    wherever possible, even if the main issues remained deadlocked. Accordingly, we
                    indicated we could accept collateral constraints on U.S. SRINF missiles and
                    specifically the Pershing-I missile, on a reciprocal basis with similar
                    constraints on Soviet SRINF, and we even talked a little about a freeze. By
                    making this proposal, the U.S. had chosen to consider an SRINF freeze in an
                    unequal outcome. This would have been justified because the SRINF constraints
                    were collateral to an agreement on LRINF, which would have been based on an
                    equal outcome. But as I said earlier, we were beginning to move more and more in
                    the direction of insisting on equal outcome in both SRINF and LRINF.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, the Soviets limited their response to their standard argument that
                    no progress could be made on collateral or secondary issues unless the central
                    issue had been resolved. The same response was made to our efforts to move on
                    verification, data exchanges, and even on work on the non-controversial elements
                    of the treaty text. Some of these non-controversial elements were boiler-plate
                    that you would find in almost any treaty. That is, “standard” language. To my
                    recollection, the Soviets did not attempt to use our mid-1980s SRINF proposal as
                    an argument for seeking to obtain an unequal outcome in SRINF when that issue
                    came under serious discussion, later in the negotiations.</p>
                <p>The Soviets continued to offer variations on their basic themes. One of these
                    proposals was worth examining, and you will see why I thought that when I get to
                    it. This was a proposal put forward by May 3, 1982, by Soviet Communist Party
                    Secretary General Yuri Andropov. He had succeeded Brezhnev upon the latter's
                    death in November 1982. His proposal was to negotiate on the basis of warheads
                    as well as missiles. The keystone of this proposal, which was introduced at the
                    opening of the round, was an equal number for only the Soviet Union's LRINF
                    warheads and the combined total of all of the warheads of U.K. and French
                    nuclear forces. The Soviets again, demanded the right to increase the size of
                    their LRINF systems, should the U.K. and/or France increase the number of their
                    warheads on their nuclear systems. There was no room for U.S. deployments and no
                    equal outcome. The absurdity of the U.S. and the Soviet Union signing a treaty
                    whose foundation rested upon the action of non-signatories, who had already
                    stated that they would not be bound by such an agreement, remained as glaring as
                    the fact that what was once again an offer of old wine in a new bottle.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>The Soviets also introduced confidence building measures, such as the prior
                    notification of missile launchings and the takeoffs of large number of aircraft.
                    We did a few things like that, but they refused to participate in the confidence
                    building working group or to negotiate such measures until major issues were
                    resolved. So they raised it as a possibility, but they didn't want to talk about
                    it yet. One could conclude that all of these new ideas were meant more for
                    public consumption than for serious negotiation. From the Soviet standpoint,
                    given the great stock they had placed in the peace demonstrators ability to
                    block the deployments and grievously damage NATO, it was understandable that
                    they didn't wish to let it appear that an agreement might be possible after all.
                    From their standpoint, the worse the situation looked, the better the climate
                    for inducing demonstrations. And indeed, we now know from writings by Soviets
                    who were involved either directly or indirectly in the negotiations, in fact
                    they had the peace movement in mind and there were times when they failed to
                    move ahead in negotiations for fear that they would undercut their friends in
                    the peace movement. It was an important factor.</p>
                <p>We also began to sense a change in the Soviets' demeanor. It was almost as if an
                    order had been given to be particularly difficult and unpleasant and a bit
                    imperious. Indeed we, and not just myself but all of us, had come back from a
                    reception, from meetings with them, from post plenary discussions, with this
                    sense that I have just described. They had sort of taken charge. Indeed, we had
                    on occasion noted that the Soviets not only followed the same policy line, that
                    was to be expected, but they also seemed to coordinate the personal attitude
                    they would adopt on a given day. These displays of what looked like deliberate
                    efforts at psychological manipulation, did not contribute to developing that
                    degree of trust which even cautious and sometimes cynical negotiators must have
                    in order to work together. In any event, the moment of truth was not far
                    off.</p>
                <p>Round Six would begin on September 6, 1983. It was quite likely that we would
                    still be in session when the first U.S. INF missiles were deployed in Europe.
                    Even before the round began, Andropov on August 26 tried to give an impression
                    of Soviet flexibility by offering to destroy all SS-20 missiles above the number
                    of French and British missiles, if the U.S. did not deploy new missiles in
                    Europe. Most of this will sound familiar and ought not to require any further
                    rebuttal. What appeared new at first blush was the offer to “destroy” SS-20s as
                    part of an agreement. Once we began to prod the Soviets on this point, its
                    newness began to evaporate as they were unable to give a clear understanding of
                    precisely what the U.S.S.R. had in mind. It particularly appeared that their
                    proposal would allow them to build and stockpile new missiles without
                    constraints.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>A few days before the scheduled opening of the round, Soviet fighter aircraft
                    shot down a Korean Airlines Boeing 747 transport. The U.S. took some steps to
                    underscore our abhorrence of this action; nevertheless, while Ambassador Nitze,
                    under instructions, raised the issue with Kvitsinsky during the first meeting of
                    the round, the U.S. did not break off the negotiations. The Soviets did not
                    reciprocate. They emphasized that there could be no agreement if the U.S.
                    deployed and that any agreement had to take British and French forces into
                    account. They began to point out that it would be fruitless to negotiate if
                    there were any deployments. To underscore that point, they began to refuse to
                    schedule meetings past October 12 and eventually only on a one-by-one basis. As
                    the negotiations were clearly moving toward a climatic moment, the U.S.
                    increased the frequency of its consultations with the allies. Thanks to the
                    support of the U.S. Air Force, I was able to attend SCG meetings and visit
                    Allied leaders in capitals in Europe and return to Geneva on the same day. As a
                    consequence, we could give the Allies timely briefings of the state of the
                    negotiations and receive their reactions first hand as well as those of
                    Washington officials at the meetings. These close and frequent consultations
                    helped further cement the solidarity among the U.S. and its NATO allies as we
                    prepared for the arrival of the U.S. missiles in Europe.</p>
                <p>One of the consequences of the consultations was the tabling of three new U.S.
                    proposals which we did on September 22, 1983. Within the context of an agreement
                    providing the right to equal levels of U.S. and Soviet LRINF missile warheads
                    globally, the U.S. would consider not offsetting the entire worldwide Soviet
                    LRINF deployment by U.S. LRINF. In other words, we had a right to deploy other
                    LRINF elsewhere up to the global level of SS-20 deployments, thus maintaining
                    the principle of an equal global outcome. But we wouldn't put them all in
                    Europe, so we would be prepared to offset some of the numbers by having them
                    elsewhere. In the context of an agreement involving significant reductions from
                    current Soviet and planned U.S. deployment levels, we said we were prepared for
                    the proportionate reductions between the Pershing II and the Ground-Launched
                    Cruise Missile in an appropriate manner. This proposal could have met specific
                    Soviet concerns regarding the P-II and, while awaiting an appropriate
                    definition, it did indicate U.S. willingness to take those concerns into
                    account. And we finally said that the U.S. would be prepared to explore equal,
                    verifiable limits on specific types of U.S. land-based aircraft consistent with
                    the Allied criteria for an INF agreement—the point was of course not to have any
                    diminution in equality of our aircraft, both numbers and abilities. We didn't
                    want to see our conventional forces hurt by this agreement. The U.S. had been
                    less enthusiastic about including aircraft in the negotiations and this was,
                    therefore, a major move on our part. However, as we noted before, given the size
                    of Soviet airplane inventory, compared with that of the U.S., they were quite
                    likely to face greater reductions to an equal level than we would. Nevertheless,
                    this offer did move toward their position.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>The Soviet reaction to these proposals was swift and negative. They would not
                    discuss any proposals which were based on the deployment of the new U.S. INF
                    systems in Europe. To do so would legitimatize deployments. The U.S. in response
                    to the Soviet reaction noted that we had negotiated while the Soviets were
                    deploying SS-20s, and we pointed out that our positions envisaged limiting all
                    LRINF missiles in the context of an equal agreement. But time was getting short,
                    and the Soviets must have been aware that we were moving towards the actual
                    physical deployment of these missiles. They remained adamant. There was nothing
                    to discuss as long as the U.S. continued to pursue deployments.</p>
                <p>On October 22, well over 1,000,000 people participated in anti-nuclear
                    demonstrations in West Germany, Britain, and Italy. Once again, as we now know,
                    the Soviet position was shaped at least in part by their consideration of the
                    role of the peace demonstrators. And once again, the Soviets failed to consider
                    that governing parties at most NATO countries and particularly in basing
                    countries were supporting deployments. On October 24, the effort to intimidate
                    NATO into abandoning the 1979 decision took an additional step. The Soviets
                    announced that they had begun to deploy nuclear missiles in Eastern Europe and
                    would complete the process if new U.S. missiles were deployed in Western
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>October 26, I saw General Secretary Andropov, proposing in a TV interview that
                    the USSR would reduce SS-20s in Europe to about 120 missiles, each of which
                    carries three warheads. This would bring the SS-20 warhead count to 420, which
                    equated to the number of warheads the Soviets attributed to the U.K. and France.
                    Andropov also offered to freeze SS-20 deployments in the eastern USSR and to be
                    flexible as regards aircraft. The package was dependent, however, on no U.S.
                    LRINF deployments in Europe. The following day in Geneva, the Soviets tabled the
                    full TASS article. The details did not make the package any more attractive. The
                    freeze in the east was contingent on a vague “no change in the strategic
                    situation” and would not go into effect until the treaty had entered into force.
                    Until then, they would have time to increase the number of missiles in that
                    region. The offer to reduce SS-20 warheads to combined British and French levels
                    was based on an inflated estimate of the size of those forces. Indeed, the
                    Soviets acknowledged that given their projections, the future growth in British
                    and French growth in warhead numbers, they would not have to reduce any or only
                    few of their SS-20s and could even increase that number as the U.K. and France
                    modernized their forces. The airplane offer was also deeply flawed. Based on
                    their aggregating U.S., U.K., and French aircraft, the Soviets acknowledged that
                    only one type of the non-U.S. aircraft would be affected by the proposed
                    reductions. This meant that the full rate of the cuts would apply to the U.S.
                    forces. Finally, none of this would be possible if U.S. LRINF missiles were
                    deployed.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>With the deployments of Ground-Launched Cruise Missiles (GLCM) and Pershing II
                    missiles scheduled to begin in Europe within weeks, the room to maneuver within
                    the negotiation was rather limited, and the number of options had shrunk. But
                    there was still some time left for carrying out the struggle in the public
                    arena, before the Bundestag took its final vote on deployment and the first
                    Pershing II arrived in West Germany. This took the form of a Soviet ploy to
                    derail the decision. In essence it was another unacceptable equal reductions to
                    an unequal outcome scheme, but with a strange twist. In parallel with the formal
                    negotiations which the sides continued, to exchange views and proposals, an
                    informal channel was opened by Kvitsinsky on Sunday, November 13, during a
                    meeting with Nitze. The conversation took place in the Geneva Botanical Garden
                    and the resulting episode would be known as the “walk-in-the-park.”</p>
                <p>The Soviet approach involved the U.S. reducing its proposed INF deployments by
                    572—that is to zero. The Soviets would reduce their INF deployments by an equal
                    amount—that is to a 120 triple warhead SS-20s. The Soviets would not demand any
                    compensation for British and French forces, which would be the subject of future
                    negotiations. However, Kvitsinsky added the Soviets wanted the proposal to be
                    made formally by the U.S. Nitze's reaction was noncommittal but not promising.
                    He did not believe Washington would accept it, and he insisted Kvitsinsky make
                    it clear to Moscow that idea was Kvitsinsky's and not Nitze's.</p>
                <p>On the next day, November 14, the U.S. announced a proposal that each side limits
                    its LRINF to 420 warheads world-wide, a level which corresponded to the number
                    of warheads that Soviet Secretary General Andropov had suggested the Soviets
                    would limit themselves in Europe. Also, and this is significant, that day,
                    November 14, the first cruise missiles arrived at Greenham Commons air base in
                    the United Kingdom, under the angry eyes of the woman peace demonstrators who
                    had been camping at the sight for some time. The deployments had begun. The
                    evening of the 14th, the Soviets, without any explanation, sent to us the
                    traditional end-of-round farewell gifts for the U.S. counterparts. But the
                    Soviets continued to participate in the negotiations. At a scheduled plenary on
                    November 15, the U.S. formally tabled its 420 warhead proposal. The Soviet
                    reaction was negative. Our proposal, while meeting the oft repeated Soviet call
                    for equal reductions, allowed U.S. deployments. The Soviets equal reductions
                    argument was thus exposed as bogus. What was left was unbending opposition to
                    either eliminating their own INF weapons or to permitting the U.S., on behalf of
                    NATO, to match Soviet warheads at any number from zero on up.</p>

                <p>Chris and I had offered to host a reception for Soviet delegation on November 15.
                    The date had been chosen with the GLCM deployments in mind. I had mentioned to
                    Chris that we would, of course, be wondering how the Soviets would react when
                    the first U.S. INF missiles arrived in Europe. She suggested we invite them to a
                    reception timed for the anticipated arrival. If they came, it would suggest that
                    both formal and informal talks could continue at least for a while. If they
                    turned down the invitation or did not show up, we could hold the traditional
                    end-of-round party. The Soviets came. In so doing, and in continuing to
                    negotiate after the GLCMs had arrived in the U.K., they once again demonstrated
                    that their real target was not deployments per se, but rather where the
                    deployments took place and perhaps also the particular missile being deployed.
                    Our conversations with the Soviets reinforced this analysis. It was Germany and
                    the Pershing II, which coincidentally had only been deployed in Germany as
                    replacements for Pershing I. Germany and Pershing-II, those were at the
                    sensitive core of the Soviet political and military position. The final vote of
                    approval by the Bundestag was yet to take place. Until then, the Soviets would
                    stay in Geneva. But I believed that once the Bundestag had given its approval,
                    they would, as Kvitsinsky had predicted at that dinner shortly before the
                    walk-in-the-woods, walk out of the negotiations in indignation.</p>
                <p>We kept Washington informed; we had been keeping Washington and through
                    Washington our allies, I should say, fully abreast of the Soviet moves, both in
                    the negotiations and in the informal walk-in-the-park channel. Kvitsinsky's
                    continued effort to suggest that, while he had put forth a proposal, Nitze
                    should be seen as the originator had put us on our guard. Thus, when on November
                    17 the Soviet Ambassador at Bonn, Vladimir Seminov, delivered a note to the
                    Foreign Ministry, claiming that Nitze had put forward an equal reduction scheme,
                    that Moscow had accepted it, but that Washington had turned it down, the Germans
                    and the other Allies already had the real story. The Soviets also leaked their
                    story to the press, but here as well, Allied spokespersons were ready to refute
                    the false tale. The effort to entrap us failed. Indeed, once exposed, their
                    deception backfired. This led to another memorable moment in these negotiations.
                    On Saturday, November 19, Nitze asked Kvitsinsky to meet him in our delegation's
                    offices. There he delivered to Kvitsinsky the official U.S. rejection of the
                    very unequal Soviet proposal to maintain the force of 120 SS-20s, with the U.S.
                    INF set at zero. He also confronted Kvitsinsky with the evidence of Soviet
                    duplicity during the walk-in-the-park episode. At that point, Kvitsinsky got up
                    and walked out of Nitze's office. I looked up from my desk, and I saw Kvitsinsky
                    leaving Nitze's office in a somewhat disoriented daze. I was aware of the
                    message he would receive, but assumed that while he would not like it, he could
                    hardly have expected otherwise. I was surprised, therefore, by his pale and
                    downcast mien. He seemed to be taking the outcome very personally.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>I wondered whether Kvitsinsky felt that the failure of the walk-in-the-park,
                    following the failure of the walk-in-the-woods, in which I believed he must have
                    gone well beyond the basic Soviet position of not accepting any U.S.
                    deployments, and even further beyond his prediction to me that the negotiations
                    would ultimately fail, could have deep and negative personal repercussions for
                    him. I escorted him out of the Botanic building. He remained crest-fallen and
                    unusually quiet on the way out except to say, “Everything is finished.” When we
                    reached the front door, the fog was as thick as Kvitsinsky's gloom. The forecast
                    had called for the clear skies in the mountains. “The sun is probably shining in
                    the Jura,” I said, “perhaps you can take some time off after you file your
                    report and take your wife up there with you.” I never found out if he did.</p>
                <p>The time was coming when we would see whether the Soviets really were going to
                    walk out, but there was some activity to take place before then. One of those
                    was a meeting on November 19 of the German Social Democrats to hold an internal
                    vote on the INF question. The party voted overwhelmingly to condemn deployment
                    of U.S. LRINF in West Germany. One of the consequences was that the Soviets
                    could really look upon this as a major accomplishment because it demonstrated
                    the extent to which the NATO defense consensus had been broken. Obviously, this
                    was unfortunate, particularly for Helmut Schmidt, who I though had done a
                    splendid job as Chancellor. But the SPD had clearly taken a move to the left as
                    a result of this decision. Everyone involved with the INF issue realized that
                    the outcome of the Bundestag debate, which would begin on November 21, would be
                    decisive for the future of the deployments, the negotiations, and frankly for
                    the Alliance. It was a very important moment.</p>
                <p>On November 22, I flew to Brussels to meet with NATO SCG members who had come
                    from their capitals to gather at this obviously momentous occasion. The purpose
                    of the meeting was to prepare for whatever was going to happen, however it would
                    work out. I was able to give them a first hand status report including our
                    estimate of what would happen next. I pointed out that it had been over a week
                    since GLCMs had arrived in the U.K., and the Soviets had nevertheless continued
                    to meet with us. Again, I emphasized that Germany was the key for the Soviets. I
                    said that NATO members should be ready, by the end of the day, with an agreed
                    Allied public position, predicated on the Soviet walk-out, following a positive
                    Bundestag vote for deployment. By the time I got back to Geneva from Brussels
                    that night, the Bundestag had made a decision. The vote was 286 to 226, in favor
                    of deploying Pershing II and GLCMs on German soil. The next day, the first
                    Pershing II missile parts arrived in West Germany.</p>
                <p>According to our standard negotiating procedures, a plenary was scheduled for
                    that day, the 23rd, and in keeping with protocol, Kvitsinsky as a guest would
                    speak first. At Nitze's suggestion, we put together possible responses based on
                    what the Soviets might say. And we really had three contingencies. One was
                    clear-cut walk-out. Another was a somewhat ambiguous position. And the third
                    basic one, what did we say if to our surprise, they continued to negotiate?</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>The plenary didn't take very long when it actually happened. The statement
                    appeared clear although I did sense that there might be a little something
                    there, but nothing sufficient to really change opinions. So basically, Nitze
                    went with the statement we had prepared, which was based on the Soviet walk-out
                    and clearly no prospect for beginning the negotiations again. The Soviet
                    language, as I have said, may have had some possible give in it, but in the end
                    that was it. As usual, I went down the elevator with Kvitsinsky and Detinov. I
                    expressed hope that they would eventually return to the table. Kvitsinsky was
                    not at all hopeful. We got to the front door of the Botanique and were
                    immediately engulfed by a sea of journalists and cameras. I stayed around long
                    enough to hear Kvitsinsky's comments to the media, which tracked the plenary
                    statement and sought to place the blame for the breakdown on the U.S. I went
                    back upstairs to our delegation meeting room, where the team was already
                    preparing our own statement for the media and our report to Washington.</p>
                <p>The next day Andropov made a statement which really closed off any prospect for
                    further talk. He basically said that there was no hope of discussion, and talks
                    could only resume when the U.S. missiles were withdrawn from Europe. And of
                    course, that was an unrealistic demand.</p>
                <p>The Soviets were in a bit of a quandary at this point. If they continued to
                    negotiate despite the threats they had made and the warnings of negative
                    consequences, they would have been seen as having fully legitimized those
                    deployments and that action would have cut the rug out from under the peace
                    movement. Even worse, it would have appeared NATO had successfully called their
                    bluff. The same logic applied to the Soviet statement ending the talks. If they
                    had a softer statement, which held open the prospect of further negotiations
                    without placing an unrealistic demand for withdrawal on us, it would have
                    encouraged strong competition from Soviet hardliners and from those who could
                    argue that a more nuanced Soviet approach would undercut the anti-deployment
                    peace movement. Let me say here, as I may have mentioned earlier, that we now
                    know that in fact these concerns about undercutting the peace movement played a
                    role in Soviet considerations and usually led to the Soviets taking a harder
                    line, rather then appearing to make concessions to the U.S. which would in their
                    view undercut the peace movement.</p>
                <p>The day after the negotiations ended was also Thanksgiving. I spent part of the
                    holiday preparing for a series of briefings which were going to begin on Friday
                    at NATO headquarters and then continuing with Allied leaders and media in
                    Belgium, the Netherlands, France, and Norway.</p>
                <p>I should note that at this point that neither Belgium nor the Netherlands had
                    voted on deployments. Eventually they would, and they would vote in favor, but
                    there were still two countries that hadn't taken that final vote. In my view,
                    what this meant was that the negotiations had broken down, but the INF battle
                    would continue. We have already seen that the main lines were clear, and we
                    understood where the differences lay.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Despite all the problems, I was rather confident that Soviets would eventually
                    return to the negotiating table. If they stayed away, they would be seen as the
                    uncooperative party, while in the meantime the deployments would continue. If
                    they returned to the negotiations, their political flank could be covered while
                    they pursued their efforts to weaken the resolve of those NATO governments that
                    had not yet formally accepted deployments. Although the peace movement had
                    failed to prevent the deployment in Germany, there was still a possibility the
                    Soviets might succeed somewhere else. But there would be no chance of this
                    outcome if the Soviets continued to boycott the Geneva negotiations. So I was
                    quite persuaded that they would return. And when the moment came, they did. But
                    it did take a little while.</p>
                <p>Obviously, eventually we left Geneva. We stayed on a little while, a bit more
                    than a little while. Essentially we stated to demonstrate that the U.S. was
                    prepared to continue negotiating. I traveled from Geneva again on “the circuit,”
                    to lots of conferences. I'd visit different NATO capitals as the issue continued
                    to bubble. It didn't go away, and I sought to demonstrate and reinforce our
                    determination to continue the negotiations and to get an arms control settlement
                    to this issue.</p>
                <p>I also realized that we were now going to face another house move. We had,
                    actually, lived in two different places in Geneva during this time that I was
                    discussing. First, Servacerie House, which was under a lease to the U.S.
                    government when we arrived, and we stayed in it till the lease ran out. The
                    government was going to have to pay for it anyway. We concluded in the end that
                    the house was probably too far gone to purchase. The grounds were magnificent
                    but the building itself was not in a good state of repair. The rent was probably
                    going to be more then we should pay. So, we felt that the government should not
                    continue the lease. In fact the owners eventually were going to sell. We found
                    another place, not too far away from this area, a smaller house, fairly new and
                    also very pleasant. We would have receptions there for the Soviets, dinners, and
                    so on. There was a fair amount of socializing, not nearly as much as you would
                    find in a normal diplomatic situation, or at NATO, but a fair amount with the
                    Soviets. We didn't do much spreading out beyond that. I think it was a full time
                    job just dealing with the negotiations. I should also point out that we worked
                    very hard within the delegation, as I think I mentioned earlier, to maintain
                    good morale so that certainly was one of the things that sticks with me from
                    that period and the subsequent time in Geneva. The building of the team was very
                    important to that work.</p>
                <p>We knew we would face another house move after Geneva. Sure enough, it was going
                    to come. That would be to the Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions (MBFR) in
                    Vienna. Mort Abramowitz was the Ambassador at MBFR, head of the delegation, and
                    I guess he wanted a change of venue. He was going to leave and he eventually
                    found another position. I think at that point became Assistant Secretary of
                    State for Intelligence and Research (INR). That left the MBFR job open. That
                    negotiation, as you know, was dealing with conventional weapons and forces in
                    Europe. I think it had been going on for about 13 years when I arrived there. It
                    would be where the next move would come.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>Before I leave Geneva entirely, I guess I should mention a couple of incidents
                    that were kind of amusing (I know that because other people have enjoyed them).
                    We had a dog, Hercules was his name, that we acquired in Brussels. His mother we
                    knew was a malamute, husky, very big dog, and the father was clearly a black
                    lab, and there was a large black lab in the area. Chris announced that she was
                    going to take the children over to see this dog, would I want to come along; we
                    knew it was a pup. I realized that there would be no returning from this place
                    without a dog. He was a cute little guy at the time. He grew up to about 100
                    pounds—and quite a character. One of the amusing things that happened with him
                    was when we had the Soviets, General Detinov, I think, and General Medvedev, and
                    their wives over for dinner. We were living at that house by the lake, and
                    Herkie was underneath the table. The discussion turned to food and somehow or
                    other, to Chinese food, and then one of the participants said, “They actually
                    eat dogs in China.” And from underneath the table came “Oughgoughgough.” He
                    understood it! He had a way of being around at receptions and on one occasion
                    one of the Soviet ladies was at a buffet table and she had picked up some kind
                    of a meat dish and was eating it. She would take a bite and put her hand down,
                    take a bite, put her hand down, but she was putting her hand down in front of
                    his nose. Eventually, he couldn't resist, she put her hand down and he snatched
                    the dish away from her. He was a real character and we had him till he died at
                    age 13. He came back to Vermont after traveling around Europe with us, but
                    didn't live much longer after that. We had a good time with him there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your social life in Geneva was their any cause for your
                        folks to be involved with the U.S. Mission to the UN European office there?
                        Did you deal with them in any way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: Only on administrative matters. They really were handling administration
                    for our ACDA activities. ACDA had its own people there, nominally we were
                    working for ACDA, so ACDA had a support staff and they were very good people.
                    They were really very helpful. But the Mission also played a role in supporting
                    us, with cars and drivers and that sort of assistance. At that point, we were
                    still in the Botanic building, but when we came back to Geneva, ACDA and the
                    delegations decided that the building was really simply not secure enough, so,
                    like a group of pirates that had left one ship and boarded another, we took over
                    several floors of the U.S. Mission to Geneva, again because of the security
                    issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We now move to the year 1984 and you are the Chief U.S.
                        Representative to the Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions in Vienna.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: Right. We moved to Vienna essentially by car. I mentioned the Jeep
                    Wagoneer that we had, with all the changes in the wiring. This was one of those
                    moves when everything was going to be changed again. We drove over the Alps to
                    Vienna from Geneva, probably had the dog with us. There we had quarters ready, I
                    think they were Abramowitz's; he had found a wonderful apartment, not far from
                    the Opera and the K�rntnerstrasse, which is the main walking street. The
                    cathedral was within a walking distance and above all the Musikverein was within
                    walking distance. It was a nice place. It was kind of a spooky building in some
                    ways. It was half empty, and there were Hungarians also located in one of these
                    apartments in this building. It was not very clear why it was this way. But, the
                    apartment itself was quite interesting. The building had been spared from
                    bombing, the front of it had, but the rear parts had been bombed and had been
                    reconstructed. We were across the street from a palace and one of the main
                    museums. We were not too far from one of the churches where there was music
                    every Sunday at mass. So it was all within walking distance, lots of shops and
                    so on, the Asch-Markt was also within walking distance.</p>
                <p>There were some security problems with the place, in addition to the Hungarian
                    representatives, essentially the terrorism aspect. Again, this had become a
                    great problem. There was only one way in and one way out of the building. I
                    searched for back doors and was unable to find any. One thing I could vary was
                    where I picked up the car. Usually I would try not to be picked up right in
                    front but I might get out, walk out the door, quickly walk in a preselected
                    direction and then the driver would know where to pick me up. Coming home I
                    could reverse that, not necessarily be driven to the front door, I'd be dropped
                    off somewhere else and just walk back. We never had any problems, thank
                    goodness, but again the threat was there and we were aware of it.</p>
                <p>MBFR had been in existence at this point for 12-13 years almost. Many people felt
                    that it was a waste of time and money. I didn't. I thought that it was useful
                    just being there and just taking place. It was one of the venues where we and
                    the Soviets, the Warsaw Pact and NATO, had an opportunity to discuss important
                    and serious issues—the goal being to try to effect a reduction in mutual
                    balanced forces. Reduction by its very title. But it had been going on long
                    enough that there were already people wondering, and the voices questioning the
                    value of these talks were getting particularly louder.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>I tried to make a few changes in the way we proceeded. One of them was to try to
                    have a little more opportunity for informal discussions after the plenaries.
                    They had the same arrangements that we had in Geneva. Once or twice a week there
                    would be a plenary meeting, in the largest room in the palace. Then there were
                    efforts at informal meetings, but they just didn't work as well as those in
                    Geneva. So I tried, since by then the Vienna talks were almost stilted, to make
                    some adjustments. We'd be sitting across a formal table from one another, rather
                    than at ease, and I tried to introduce an additional session which would be
                    similar to the informal post-plenaries we had in Geneva. The Soviets were not
                    very interested in doing that, and particularly didn't like the idea that the
                    military might somehow not sit with the diplomats. That kind of right down
                    troubled them. I guess they really wanted to just check on one another. There
                    were various efforts going on, trying to configure the talks. But I learned that
                    there was going to be another meeting in Vienna, of another European body,
                    coming out of the CSCE, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe,
                    the Helsinki final act. There was yet another set of actors, if you will,
                    including Americans, who were going to come to Vienna, and there would be a
                    conference to talk about the future activities in that particular operation,
                    which was looking at mutual confidence building measures, ways to try to watch
                    one another's exercises and so on. And it really sort of overlapped with MBFR.
                    There was no question that there was some overlap with MBFR.</p>
                <p>As I began to think what the future for MBFR held, it seemed to me that the fact
                    that these two organizations dealing with so much similar matter, both going to
                    be meeting in Vienna at the same time, could quite rightly focus attention on
                    the fact that MBFR had been there for all these years and obviously hadn't
                    reached any fruition. I decided to call the staff together and discuss this a
                    bit with them and concluded that what we ought to do is prepare a rather full
                    paper, essentially looking at the options for the future of the MBFR,
                    recognizing that it would come into question. Leo Reddy was the Political
                    Counselor there, Vlad Lehovich was the DCM, both of them had been there with
                    Mort Abramowitz and they stayed on with me. I'd met them before and they both
                    were very able. I asked Leo to undertake the job of preparing this paper. It was
                    a major effort and a very thick paper. Its nickname was “Fat Paper” because it
                    got so big. But Washington was interested in receiving something like this.</p>
                <p>What we did was lay out all these various options. We gave them all names. One of
                    them we called “Quick and Dirty.” That was an option which would have the U.S.
                    and the Soviets agree to a 10% reduction in forces and that would be the
                    achievement, that would be the end of the negotiations on MBFR, and we could
                    move on to some other approach. Another I called, “Fold, Spindle, and Mutilate”
                    was just a clear “It's not working, let's leave.” My favorite I called “Death
                    and Transfiguration.” And that was an option which would allow MBFR to come to a
                    sort of conclusion, but would effectively transform it into a new negotiation
                    with perhaps somewhat different guidelines. That is in fact what happened. It
                    did end, and it was replaced by the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE)
                    negotiations, and that negotiation achieved a treaty. We do now have agreed
                    levels of reductions, where forces can be stationed, etc., in Europe, both with
                    former Warsaw Pact and with NATO.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>At about that point (we arrived in Vienna in August and this was probably
                    somewhere in November or so), meetings had begun at a senior level between the
                    U.S. and the Soviets about rejuvenating INF, about bringing it back together. I
                    was obviously aware of this, and interested in them, but I didn't lobby for
                    anything. I had been assigned to Vienna, I had a job to do, and I would not try
                    to do otherwise. Out of the blue, totally unexpected, I received a phone call
                    from Secretary Shultz—asking me if I would be willing to go back to Geneva. Of
                    course I said, “Yes, sir, I would.” Subsequently I received a phone call from
                    President Reagan, following up on this and adding he knew that we had just moved
                    to Vienna from Geneva, and this would be a move back, and he appreciated that. I
                    told him I would be more than happy to serve as his representative to INF
                    negotiations again—that I appreciated the opportunity.</p>
                <p>The only one who was unhappy about this was our daughter Becky, our youngest
                    daughter. She had been reasonably happy with the school in Geneva, but it was
                    British and run under British rules, so to speak, and some of this bothered her.
                    She really liked the American school in Vienna and the day that I got the phone
                    call from the secretary and then the president, we were at a reception that
                    night. Becky had gone off to a party at the school. I was able to tell to Chris,
                    whisper to her about this, but we couldn't say anything in the car, because I
                    didn't want the driver to know anything about it. So Chris and I got in the car,
                    the driver was going to take us to the school, pick Becky up, and then bring her
                    home. So we did that, picked her up, asked her how the party was. She was
                    bubbling with joy, how much fun it had been and how great this school this was,
                    and we had to contain ourselves. I couldn't say anything to her until we finally
                    got out of the car and back into the apartment. Then I had to tell her I had
                    some bad news for her. But she is a good trooper, and obviously agreed and back
                    we went to Geneva.</p>
                <p>So it was a short time at MBFR. I did come back after Christmas; I think we were
                    there for Christmas and New Year's Day. At that point, the Austrians had invited
                    the diplomatic corps to a outing at Schladming for skiing. Chris and I of course
                    were not going to pass that up, so we went on that excursion. They took us on a
                    train, we got there, and I'll brag a little bit now. There was a journalist
                    along on this trip and he was watching all of the diplomats skiing. Afterwards,
                    he wrote an article in one of the Vienna newspapers about this diplomatic outing
                    and the skiing. He said most of these ambassadors weren't very good, but only
                    two were of “renner qualitat,” which is racing quality, and that was the
                    Australian and the American, Glitman. So I'd clipped that out, it was a total
                    exaggeration, but it's nice to have an Austrian paper say something like that.
                    Of course this guy wasn't a sports journalist, he was in politics, but anyway, I
                    enjoyed that, it was a nice way to leave there. It was about six months in all.
                    Then back to Geneva, but first, we had to go through Washington. That is another
                    story.</p>
                <p>The phone calls that I received from the Secretary Shultz and subsequently from
                    President Reagan telling me that I would be coming back to head the INF
                    delegation were made on the 18th of January. By the 21st of January I had
                    already flown back to Washington and begun a series of meetings with senior
                    officials, including the president.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is in 1985?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: 1985. I had a whole week of those meetings, in which I was preparing for
                    the job and getting ready for hearings as well, which were obviously a part of
                    the process. What I found when I got back was that the negotiations were going
                    to be set up in a somewhat different way than we had carried on during the first
                    set of INF negotiations. For the first set, we had our own INF delegation—our
                    own negotiation. At the same time as we were meeting, the strategic arms
                    reduction talks, START people, that were headed by former General Rowny and the
                    deputy negotiator was Jim Goodby. They were also meeting, but these were two
                    separate negotiations with two separate communication channels. We kept a very
                    similar time-table, maybe we'd start a week earlier than they did and end a week
                    earlier, or vice-versa. But essentially, although we were occupying the same
                    office building, they were separate talks.</p>
                <p>In the work-up to come back to the negotiating table, the Soviets, Gromyko and
                    others working with Secretary Shultz, ultimately came together on a different
                    approach for this set of new negotiations. The fundamental reason for the
                    difference was the arrival of the Space Defense Initiative, popularly and
                    incorrectly known as “Star Wars.” The Soviets very leery of that approach; they
                    made a very strong case that given the relationship between the strategic
                    offense and strategic defense, you really ought to conduct a single negotiation.
                    But they would be prepared to see the talks broken up in three segments, all of
                    which would, at the same time, try to come together into a final package. And
                    there would therefore be the strategic arms reduction talks, the defense and
                    space talk, dealing with the space defense initiative, and INF. The formula that
                    they agreed upon made it possible to have a grand package, but it did not
                    exclude the possibility that there might be separate agreements. I personally
                    believed that in fact, the best way to deal with the space defense question and
                    the strategic question is to put the two together in some fashion. Because in
                    the end you can have trade offs between, “Alright, if you want so many offensive
                    missiles, that would allow me to have some many defensive missiles,” and
                    vice-versa. So one could get it down to numbers and talk about the balance that
                    each side would have and allow the other side to have between the offensive and
                    defensive systems.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>The problem for INF, however, was that it really didn't fit neatly into this
                    package. There was obviously some relationship because of the overlaying ranges
                    between INF systems and strategic systems, but essentially they did serve
                    different purposes. It was particularly true of the Soviet SS-20s. What made
                    them such a politically charged weapon was the fact that from their normal
                    bases, where Soviets were placing them, they really could not strike the U.S.
                    proper. I had mentioned earlier that if they put them in a base way up north
                    they could, but from where they were putting them, they couldn't strike the
                    U.S.—or maybe just the corner of Alaska—but essentially not reach too deeply
                    into the U.S. But they could strike Europe and much of Asia. If you look at some
                    of the charts we had prepared to show the range arcs from the SS-20s, a fairly
                    high percentage of human beings were in the range of those weapons. The fact,
                    therefore, was that it was a system about which the Soviets could tell the
                    Europeans, “We've got these weapons, they are for you. The Americans, they can't
                    protect you in the same way as they could before.” We tried, I think as I
                    mentioned before, to persuade the Europeans earlier that our strategic systems
                    in the region were sufficient to provide deterrence; they were not so sure. We
                    had agreed with them and began the process that lead to the 1979 decision on the
                    deployment and negotiations. But there was still this factor about the SS-20s
                    that made them particularly politically dangerous, the ability to say that these
                    systems were the ones which the Soviets had and which were capable of striking
                    Europe but not really a threat to the U.S. That was really an effort to try to
                    break up the linkage that we had between our systems in Europe, our defense of
                    NATO, and our strategic forces. It had that effect, the Soviet effort, to split
                    the Alliance in a very sensitive way.</p>
                <p>That being said, I felt that U.S. SDI deployments were not a particular threat to
                    the Soviet INF missiles, so the link between SDI and INF was not as salient as
                    that between SDI and Strategic Offensive Forces. It would therefore be difficult
                    for us to explain to our NATO allies why an INF agreement was being held up for
                    lack of an agreement on SDI—particularly when the Allies were somewhat skeptical
                    of the concept and the utility of SDI. You see, my concern here was that you
                    could argue that the more issues you had to deal with in the grand package, the
                    more room you had for reaching an agreement. Trading this off against that. The
                    problem here was that we could not and certainly could not be seen as trading
                    off something which was of interest to our allies in the INF area, in order to
                    get something in the strategic side. This would be seen as our leaving them in
                    the lurch, so to speak, and would have enormous political repercussions. So it
                    seemed to me that we really needed to try our best to se if we could not work
                    out a separate arrangement for INF; without having INF held up because of this
                    back and forth on the SDI and strategic side.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>In any case, the way that the U.S. delegation was set up reflected the fact that
                    there were these three separate negotiations under one sort of umbrella
                    organization. The responsibility for the conduct of the negotiations in each
                    group appeared clear. It would rest with the chief negotiator for that group:
                    Max Kampelman for the strategic defense group; former Senator John Tower for
                    START; and me for INF. It soon became apparent, that answering the question of
                    how, when, or if to consider and resolve the three subject areas and their
                    relationship was less clear. That interrelationship came out of the communiqu�
                    following Secretary Shultz's meeting with Foreign Minister Gromyko which opened
                    the way to resume the negotiations.</p>
                <p>Kampelman was designated as head of delegation for the Nuclear and Space Talks,
                    which was the title given to the umbrella organization. And he carried the
                    additional title of Chief of Mission. Tower and I both received ambassadorial
                    rank, as well as Kampelman, but he received the additional title of Chief of
                    Mission. This was very beneficial to us in administrative terms, because it
                    meant that the NST delegation would be afforded the same type of administrative
                    arrangements as an Embassy. There was a press conference following the
                    announcement of the U.S. negotiators. Secretary Shultz was asked about the
                    duties of the head of the delegation and the relationship of the head of the
                    delegation to the specific negotiation. And the question was, “Would you say
                    then that Senator Tower and Mr. Glitman would report to Mr. Kampelman who in
                    turn would report to you? Who will report to the president? Is that the chain of
                    command?” And the Secretary replied that the chain of command is that each of
                    these heads of delegations, or heads of these groups, would get their
                    instructions directly from the president. Now, the process of developing the
                    instructions for each session is obviously something that we all participate in.
                    But in the end there will be separate instructions for each one of these talks.
                    And then he said, “I think it has been very clear to us for quite some time,”
                    and the Soviets had put a lot of emphasis on this too, “That there are very
                    clear relationships among these different sets of issues. We expect that it will
                    be important in their conduct that there will be a lot of comparing notes across
                    different groups. And Ambassador Kampelman on the spot would be the person who's
                    responsibility it is to coordinate that and be sort of a convener.” That was how
                    he reacted to those sorts of questions about how this is going to work. He made
                    clear in that statement that all of the negotiators would bear responsibility
                    for their negotiations, have their own channel of communications with
                    Washington, but what would be coordinated and the role of the head of delegation
                    as a convener was less clear, especially if it turned out there was no grand
                    package to coordinate. In fact, you could not put together a single
                    arrangement.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>As you saw, the head of delegation, in Secretary Shultz's words, “would convene
                    meetings of all three groups when and if these were considered desirable.” In
                    practice, while there were two or three joint plenary sessions per round
                    involving all three groups, where we'd all sit at the table, there was never any
                    real overlap between INF and the other groups, except for the Soviets on-again,
                    off-again, linking of the INF agreement with a satisfactory conclusion of START
                    and SDI agreements. The joint plenaries did not have a remarkably positive
                    impact on resolving INF issues or the START-SDI relationship. Neither John
                    Tower, Ron Lehman, who succeeded Tower as the START negotiator, nor I,
                    considered joint plenaries very useful. We recognized they were in essence
                    mandated by the Shultz-Gromyko agreement, but we did seek to minimize their
                    content and frequency. Each of the three negotiations was complex and detailed;
                    this was true for INF and later for START, it was even more so as the talks drew
                    closer towards a resolution. Putting an agreement together in even one of the
                    areas would be difficult enough. Trying to trade off concessions between them, I
                    felt as did Tower and later Lehman, would greatly delay or even block our final
                    agreement. The Soviets on the other hand were rather anxious to have these joint
                    plenary meetings. In part because they improved the prospect of embroiling the
                    U.S. and NATO in an effort to roll up the three negotiations in a grand package,
                    at least, that is my view of it.</p>
                <p>One of the reasons that I preferred serving abroad rather than in Washington was
                    the near constant battles over turf at the seat of the national government. It
                    is not my intention to belabor bureaucratic intricacies, as I have done in a way
                    now, but in this instance the forum had a potential for becoming substance. And
                    I felt very strongly that the manner in which the INF agreement was sought,
                    including its relationship with the strategic and defense and space issues,
                    would have a major impact on many of its elements, and on how it and the process
                    of negotiation was perceived by our Allies and the Soviets. As I said, my basic
                    concern was that we not find ourselves in a position where we would be seen at
                    least to have made some sort of trade-off which was not favorable to the Allies,
                    in order to obtain something that would be favorable to us. I was conscious,
                    given the way that the negotiations had gone up to this point, that the Soviets
                    would do their best, and they certainly wouldn't pass up an opportunity to do
                    this, and I believed that they would try to figure out some way to achieve this
                    result. As I've tried to make clear before, INF was probably more of a political
                    issue than an arms control issue. The basic issue at stake was the future of the
                    Alliance, and solidarity of the Alliance. And up until this point we had been
                    doing rather well. I think on the very day that the talks had reopened in
                    Geneva, that the Belgian parliament accepted the deployments. Only the Dutch
                    Parliament had yet to act.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>I had differences with Kampelman, and they were real, in this whole question of a
                    separate INF negotiation or a grand package. They were purely substantive and by
                    no means personal. I liked him very much and had great respect for his
                    abilities. I saw him at work and particularly I remember one occasion when a
                    group of Senators were visiting us and they got into a discussion about some
                    problem they were having on defense and space issues in the Congress,
                    particularly in the Senate. And Max, brilliantly, listened to both sides and
                    then came together with a way that they could compromise their differences. He
                    was an excellent mediator. But on this issue, we just had different views. He
                    told me and General William Burns, from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a member
                    of the INF group, that he didn't think we would ever get a separate INF
                    agreement; that the grand package was the only way to resolve this. I felt
                    differently, but I had to work within the arrangements that were made. He was
                    the head of the delegation; it was set up the way it was set up. But at the same
                    time, I would do my best to see whether we could move ahead separately if
                    possible because there was no bar to that approach. So it was just a difference
                    of opinion on how best to move ahead on this area. In the end, I know he came
                    around to the view that a separate INF agreement was possible and the way to go.
                    But at this juncture, as we began the talks, there were these differences. Again
                    I want to emphasize, they were not personal. The personal side was good.</p>
                <p>In any case, we had to work with these sorts of differences. There was a hope of
                    continuing the negotiations by the three individual groups, and those who
                    thought that we could arrive at a grand package continued working in that
                    direction. I certainly did my best and emphasized the separate nature of INF. I
                    preferred to hold the whole so-called social events, which were a continuation
                    of negotiations in a different format, with the Soviet INF members, rather than
                    to encourage large group meetings. I felt it didn't seem very practical for all
                    three groups to meet socially, because I certainly would not expect someone from
                    the INF team to go ahead and try to begin negotiating informally with someone
                    from the Soviet START team, and vice-versa. So we tried to work on social events
                    with the Soviet INF team, in order that we could carry-on our negotiations in a
                    somewhat more informal way. Hopefully, we would find some way to open
                    possibilities to reach an agreement. During the first week of negotiations, I
                    met alone for lunch with my Soviet counterpart, Ambassador Alexi Obukhov.</p>
                <p>I might say a word now about Obukhov. He had a reputation as a younger officer,
                    when he was dealing with the SALT negotiations, for being a very forthcoming,
                    open-minded, flexible fellow. Subsequently, those who dealt with him during the
                    first set of negotiations, the START negotiations that ended in 1983 when
                    Soviets walked out of START just as they walked out of INF, had a different
                    impression. Obukhov was dealing with START during that period and his reputation
                    was quite different. He was extremely cautious and very careful; he didn't seem
                    to want to engage in any “what-if “type of discussion. He had tendency to be
                    rather long-winded as well. In any case, he was the man that I sat across from
                    throughout most of this period. There were periods when someone else would come
                    and take his place, but he was there most of the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to know his family, have any kind of
                        relationship with him socially?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: No. His wife was there, and we did meet her. He did not have any
                    youngsters with him. I know that he had some. Perhaps an anecdote or two will
                    sort of capsulate the difficulties I had dealing with him, as I saw them.</p>
                <p>One was during one of our early meetings. I suggested to him that it might be
                    interesting Ambassador to see how the world would look from another capital. I
                    said, for example, if you were sitting in an Eastern European capital, and
                    looked out and saw the Soviet Union, you might very well see a huge, powerful
                    country, one with which you had had difficulties in history. On the other hand,
                    I could see, if you were sitting in Moscow, looking out over the world, you
                    would see on all sides countries who at one time or another had invaded you. He
                    got very angry. I said, “Can you not put yourself in someone else's shoes that
                    way? Try to put yourself in our shoes, or our European ally shoes. I just put my
                    self in your shoes; I can see how you look at the world.” And he said. “That's
                    very unprofessional. I would have expected that from a political appointee, but
                    not from a career officer.” I was dumbfounded. Anyway, that was one example.</p>
                <p>The other was a little more humorous. Ambassador John Woodworth, my deputy and
                    also the Defense Department representative on our delegation, and I would have
                    once a week, or every so often, a lunch with Ambassador Obukhov and General
                    Medvedev, who had been in the earlier negotiation, as had John. At one of those
                    lunches I thought, “Why don't we go to a Chinese restaurant?” I must admit there
                    was a little mischievousness in selecting the Chinese restaurant, because the
                    Soviets and the Chinese were having some difficulties at the time. So okay, I
                    plead guilty to that. But I thought it would be interesting change anyway. We
                    went to this Chinese restaurant. As we sat down, I think neither he nor General
                    Medvedev seemed to have much knowledge of Chinese food, I am certainly no
                    expert, but anyway, we ordered the meal. Then I said, “Well, what to drink? I
                    hear beer goes very well with Chinese food. And they have Tsingtao beer here,”
                    which is Chinese beer, and it's quite good. Why don't you try some of that?” He
                    said, “No, no, I don't want that. I'll have a Cardinal,” which was a Swiss beer.
                    I tried once more and I said, “This Tsingtao brewery was built by the Germans,
                    who also know a lot about beer making. It is Chinese owned now. I've had it, and
                    it's good.” And he said, “No. I never try anything I haven't had before.”</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>We did actually have some very serious discussions, obviously. Most of them were
                    serious. I wish we could have had a little more humor in them. During one of
                    those early luncheons with him, I tried something out. I said, “Look. I could
                    see the logic (in linkage), I think I may see the link between the strategic and
                    the defense questions, but it wasn't as compelling in INF.” And he came back in
                    a rather didactic manner, which I had been told to expect, and said that logic
                    had some merits but there were other ways of considering what was logical. Then
                    I asked him “Would the Soviet Union agree to a separate INF treaty in a
                    situation where the U.S. had accepted the Soviet position in INF?” In other
                    words, “We accept your INF position, would you then agree on a separate treaty?”
                    And he though about it and allowed that in such an unlikely event, it probably
                    would. His reply carried with it the implication that the same conclusion would
                    logically apply in the case where the two sides had reached a mutually
                    acceptable agreement. With that point made, I did not belabor it further. But
                    that conversation and his response left me with a distinct impression that the
                    Soviets could, and ultimately would, accept a separate INF agreement. Part of my
                    sense that this would be necessary, again on the political side, was that we
                    could find ourselves at a point in the negotiations where their unwillingness to
                    accept what our allies and allied populations agreed, was a very generous offer,
                    very fair offer from us, and for them to turn it down because of a link to SDI
                    or START would then be held against them. So that sort of strengthened my sense
                    that we could probably achieve this type of an agreement.</p>
                <p>Again, as the talks proceeded, there were some indications that there might be a
                    possible shift in the Soviet policy on this topic. Some of it, I admit it, was
                    grasping at straws in a way, but this was from a Pravda editorial, I won't go
                    into all the details, but I could see that in the editorial there were rather
                    sharp distinctions drawn between the linkage between the SDI and START and the
                    linkage with INF. There was a phrase, for example, “INF could be self-contained”
                    and related INF to the situation in the European continent and outside of it.
                    But they didn't mention linkage to SDI in the editorial. But Pravda editorials
                    are one thing. Statements by the leader of the country are another. During
                    Gorbachev's October 1985 visit to Paris, he spoke of the possibility of a
                    separate INF agreement. He said something like, “Concerning medium range nuclear
                    weapons in Europe, with the aim of making easier agreement, we consider it
                    possible to conclude a corresponding agreement separately, outside of direct
                    connection with the problem of space and strategic arms.” This road, as it
                    appears, turned out to be practical. That was a breakthrough in a sense. The
                    Soviets would, after that speech, sometimes reinforce the idea of a separate INF
                    agreement and we have Gorbachev doing that, and in other times they might pull
                    it back. As the negotiations developed, we are going to see, on more than one
                    occasion, where Gorbachev said something which would have moved the talks
                    forward, and then suddenly later on it got pulled back. This was beginning of
                    that element of the negotiations. As I said, we'll see later as I go through
                    this process that I will be able to show you other examples.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>Indeed, in this instance, January 16, 1986, Gorbachev made a very major speech on
                    the whole broad arms control approach. I would say it was one of the best pieces
                    of work the Soviets did in this era. It was very comprehensive and very
                    compelling; you really needed to know the intricacies of the negotiation to find
                    the flaws in it. But, they were there. It was a well done job by them.</p>
                <p>In this speech, Gorbachev seemed to put linkage back into effect. In other words,
                    he referred to the settlement of the SDI question as a precondition for moving
                    ahead on his proposal on eliminating all offensive nuclear weapons by the year
                    2000. It was a major thing then—all offensive weapons out by 2000. The specific
                    linkage with SDI was contained in a sweeping proposal dealing with nuclear arms
                    which can reach each other's territories—that is strategic arms. A separate
                    portion of the speech called for the complete liquidation of Soviet and U.S.
                    medium range missiles in the European zone. Again, this is a “zero” coming from
                    their side, but limited to the European zone, and, as we've seen, the Soviet
                    SS-20s outside of Europe were still capable of hitting targets in most of NATO
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>And then, after January 16, there was a press conference, and one of the Soviet
                    deputy Foreign Ministers, Korniyenko, made clear that the fate of SDI would
                    apply to INF. Korniyenko had a reputation as a very hard liner and again, we
                    sensed that Gorbachev talked a bit about linkage, but it was someone else who
                    came in and really made a strong case that there will be linkage. My feeling at
                    that point was that the linkage issue was a non-winner for them. And that they
                    would ultimately drop it, so it was merely a matter of time before they would
                    come back to what Gorbachev had said in Paris.</p>
                <p>Let me see if I can run through linking and de-linking that had occurred during
                    this period of several years. I noted they started out linking, then in the 1985
                    visit to Paris we had Gorbachev's de-linking, then in January 1986 a re-linking,
                    and then again in February 1986 Gorbachev used the media-worthy event of a visit
                    by Senator Ted Kennedy to suggest once again that a separate INF treaty was
                    possible. Then on February 25th Gorbachev announced that the Star Wars program
                    must not be allowed to be used both as a stimulus for a further arms race and as
                    an obstruction on a road to radical disarmament. There he seemed to be
                    de-linking it again. That de-linking would last until the Reykjavik summit, and
                    at the Reykjavik summit, the Soviets once again re-linked. I was confident that
                    in the end, they were going to have to de-link. The political negatives of their
                    trying to tie up INF with SDI and START were going to be so strong that they
                    would back off in the end. And in fact they did.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>That was on February 28, 1987. On that date, Gorbachev announced the Soviet Union
                    “proposes taking the problem of medium range missiles in Europe out of the block
                    of issues and concluding a separate agreement on this subject.” Gorbachev also
                    noted that de-linkage would remove, and this is a very important point to make,
                    de-linkage would remove much of the nuclear burden from our common home, which
                    is Europe. This became a major theme for Gorbachev at this point. “Our common
                    European home.” And guess who doesn't live in that home? That's right, the U.S.
                    is outside of this picture. In his memoirs, Gorbachev later says, “Well, I
                    didn't mean to exclude the U.S.” But I think it is clear from the way this began
                    that this was his move in that direction. And this has broad strategic
                    significance as well, in the sense of political policy. He is backing off of the
                    hard-nosed line. He is seeing, rightly, that he can be more effective by taking
                    a warm approach, than by a cold one. You could see once he took over, even
                    before maturing in this common European home theme, that all of the initiatives
                    that he took after January 16 and so on, were part of a war of maneuver. This
                    was a war of movement on his side. He hadn't given up the objective, but he was
                    pursuing it by showing in a sense a very real flexibility. Again, we can find
                    flaws in what he was saying, from our standpoint, but he was very good at
                    portraying this willingness to move forward. Perestroika, democratization,
                    openness, etc. All of these slogans were designed not only to have an impact
                    internally but also to send a message out to the Europeans and particularly the
                    NATO Europeans. So, this “common home” theme fits, and this is an example why,
                    in my view, there would be no further re-linking. This fact was happily
                    recognized and supported by all on the SDI delegations. President Reagan
                    welcomed this announcement. He made reference to the European political aspect
                    of this event by stressing the importance of close cooperation between the U.S.
                    and its European allies. And I'll quote this because I have it in my notes here.
                    “As we proceed, it is well to remember that nothing is more important to the
                    cause of peace than the credibility of our commitment to NATO and our other
                    allies and the vitality of these alliances of free nations.” The President's
                    statement was well attuned to the “common European home” theme and presented our
                    side. But this was a qualitative change in the discussion at this junction. We
                    were going to get a treaty, and this was the beginning of a sign that we might
                    get that treaty, but the contest was not over. The contest was seen, basically,
                    as the Soviets trying to split the alliance or to move the allies closer to the
                    Soviet Union. The Soviets had not given up on that objective. With the agreement
                    on a separate INF treaty, we also had to turn to some other issues and I want to
                    work our way through some of those.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>But before I do that, I should have mentioned earlier, one of the things that set
                    the INF group apart from how the U.S. had put forward negotiating teams in the
                    past. That was the continuity we had. The people who were involved in the first
                    set of negotiations, obviously Ambassador Nitze, myself, John Woodworth, the
                    Department of Defense Representative General William Burns, the JSC
                    representative, three key players, and people from ACDA, various people, Lucas
                    Fisher and others at different times. Our lawyers were also from ACDA, Tom
                    Graham and Karen Lawson at the time, now Karen Look. These same people came back
                    to the INF negotiations where we reopened. Nitze left and I took over as a head
                    of the group, but General Burns was there and John Woodworth was there. Also
                    there was Tom Graham, like so many others, such as Lucas Fisher, and Stan
                    Riveles. I'd better stop because I will leave somebody out, and I already have,
                    but it made a difference. Usually the Soviets kept the continuity and we changed
                    the teams, but in this instance we had the same folks. So there was no
                    breaking-in period, we all knew each other, we all worked together, we all had
                    the same memories of what had happened in the past, and we could build on those.
                    It really made a tremendous difference. I should add that not only did this team
                    have continuity, but these were very, very able people. All of them. We had put
                    together a wonderful group. Good back-stopping in Washington as well, and also a
                    degree of continuity there.</p>
                <p>The other point that I think I should make is, I mentioned and I will probably
                    mention again, the numbers of trips that I made to NATO capitals during this
                    period. I have already commented that the Air Force made much of this possible.
                    But I also want to emphasize the importance of the assistance I received from
                    the American Embassies on these visits. They were the ones who would select the
                    journalists that I ought to meet, they were the ones who set up the lunches or
                    the dinners or the cocktails or whatever, the venues of the places, and the ones
                    who would indicate, “these are the officials that you really ought to meet and
                    the senior people, and here are some of the more junior ones who are more active
                    on this issue, etc.” They made those trips very fruitful for all of us, and I
                    appreciated that effort on their part.</p>
                <p>I want to talk next about some issues. We are sort of skipping around, not
                    necessarily n chronological order, and I am going to work on this subject by
                    issues. We just dealt with the separate INF treaty. The next issue that we need
                    to turn to is something we referred to as “Asia and how we got to a global
                    zero.” INF was, as you've seen, principally about our relations with our NATO
                    allies. But, it also had an impact on our Asian allies, and we did take that
                    into account. It didn't start out quite like that. There was a tendency to look
                    at INF as essentially a European issue. Fortunately, we had John Woodworth to
                    remind us about Asia. Frequently, when we would start talking about problems, we
                    were focusing on how it was going to impact on NATO Europe, for example, the way
                    we would treat SS-20s located east of the Urals and so on. John would be there
                    to remind us that we did, in fact, have Asian allies, principally Japan and
                    South Korea, and that there was also a Chinese impact here. As a consequence, we
                    were always able to factor Asian considerations into these issues. Because, John
                    would be there to say, “Hey, don't forget this.” After a while he didn't have to
                    say that any longer; we all were attuned to that subject as an issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>As the negotiations went on, our policy line also began to broaden to make Asian
                    concerns an important part of the argument that the INF treaty needed a global
                    basis, and that it would be better to deal with limitations on these weapons not
                    just as they applied to Europe, but indeed globally. No matter where they were
                    deployed, they really ought to be eliminated. That was a major step, because I
                    don't think there had been many instances before in arms control history where,
                    for example, you looked at chemical and biological weapons, but no real program
                    to actually carry out this elimination. They were to be banned, but this was
                    basically going to eliminate them, and no more production, no more testing, no
                    more missiles. Our feeling, our belief was that it would be easier to make the
                    agreement durable and sound if the ban, the elimination, took place on a global
                    basis. And it had a side effect of making clear to our Asian allies and friends
                    their benefits from this treaty as well as those for our European allies and
                    friends. In any case, the Soviets began most of their deployment in the European
                    side, but as the negotiations went on, we saw more and more new deployments, new
                    bases being set up in the east. I think someone had estimated that the SS-20
                    could target 62% of the world's population, including all of Europe, China, the
                    Middle East, the Near East, most of India, much of Southeast Asia, and a large
                    portion of northern Africa. And yet, they were not, strictly speaking, strategic
                    weapons; they could not reach 5,500 kilometers, which is the beginning range for
                    strategic weapons. They were a different category, but as you can see, they
                    needed control. Because of the impact they had on security and stability across
                    a large part of the world.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>We began fairly early in the process to explore a little bit with the Soviets,
                    what might be done, explicitly in behalf of Asia, as opposed to eliminating them
                    as a consequence of eliminating weapons, SS-20s that were capable of striking
                    Europe, that would obviously have some impact on the SS-20s not being there,
                    therefore, they would not be able to strike some of these other targets in say
                    North Africa or Middle East. So we began to think about how to bring
                    Soviet-Asian INF missiles into an agreement. I would probe my Soviet
                    counterparts on their views of the political aspects of INF in Asia and
                    particularly China's role in this equation. They were very leery of even
                    discussing the subject. Only General Nikolai Detinov, who was my counterpart in
                    the first set of negotiations, was prepared to engage on this topic, and his
                    comments, while elliptical, left me with an impression that a deeply ingrained
                    Soviet concern rooted in fear over China would be a factor in their decision, on
                    whether and to what extent, they would be prepared to reduce their Asian INF
                    missiles in the context of a bilateral negotiation with us. And, interestingly
                    enough, one of the Soviet interpreters, Pavel Pavlishenko, a very able man,
                    wrote some memoirs, after the INF treaty. He ended being an interpreter for
                    Shevardnadze and then Gorbachev. He noted in his book that fear of China was
                    widely spread in Soviet Union—and this is a quote from his book— “including the
                    country's leaders” and “it often reached the point of hysteria.” That was very
                    telling. As I said, I sensed that attitude from my discussion, and it was
                    interesting to have it confirmed. But you can see how that impacted on their
                    seeing what we were doing, trying to reduce the SS-20s in Asia. From there,
                    while NATO concerns remained in the forefront, increasingly Japan and South
                    Korea came into the picture, and we had our eyes open to the fact. Now from a
                    Soviet stand-point, it would have been China that they would have been most
                    concerned about. So, trying to get them to go to zero globally was not going to
                    be easy.</p>
                <p>There was one other great advantage in going to zero globally. And that was,
                    verification would be far easier to carry out. If you allow 100 large missile
                    systems, you have to make sure that the next one you see is not the 101st. And
                    we had come up with all kinds of technical ways of trying to deal with this. One
                    was tags. These would be sort of like a license plate that you couldn't fiddle
                    with, that you couldn't remove. And these would be placed on Soviet launchers.
                    On ours too. Then when the inspectors came, they would run some kind of electric
                    beam over it, and they would say, “This is the right tag for this vehicle,
                    fine.” Or if they didn't they'd say, “Something is wrong here.” We were looking
                    at things like that. Actually we even produced a couple of models; I was given
                    one of those tags as a sort of a memento after this was all over. But we
                    wouldn't need those if there was zero. Because if you see one, it's a violation.
                    There is no question of whether this is “the104th,” it is a missile launcher.
                    That would make it much easier to do and that would reduce the amount of
                    control, the number of inspections we would need, and so forth. That was a big
                    plus from going to zero. We did anticipate that verification would be a major
                    issue during the Senate hearings on the treaty, as indeed it turned out to
                    be.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>The Soviets eventually began to get the sense that the political nature of this
                    issue for them was as well with countries in Asia and Europe. One sign of that
                    was a proposal in October 1983 by Soviet General Secretary Andropov, which added
                    to one of the many proposals to reduce SS-20s, to match the Soviet count with
                    British and French warheads, we've seen that constant theme. But he added to
                    that and offered to freeze a number of SS-20s in Asia, as long as the U.S.
                    deployed no similar weapons in the region. But it really wouldn't be until
                    Gorbachev took over the reins that the Soviets began a more serious effort to
                    improve relations with the Asians and to recognize how their INF deployments in
                    Asia impacted on that effort. They walked out of the negotiations before we had
                    any real exploration of INF in Asia, let alone any practice, but when they came
                    back to Geneva, that issue came back with them. And here we were looking at
                    their deployment pattern, and we could see that the Asian element took on
                    growing importance after the negotiations resumed.</p>
                <p>One of the things we did in the INF negotiations—it had been done before—was to
                    set up a Senate and House Observer Group. The Senate Observer Group was headed
                    by Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska. He was a co-chair I think along with Senator
                    Nunn. The fact that he was from Alaska also played a role in focusing our
                    attention on Soviet Asian SS-20 deployments. He lost no time in reminding us
                    that the SS-20s could reach portions of his state. To keep him abreast of our
                    efforts to obtain reductions and eventually the elimination of SS-20s in Asia, I
                    encouraged him to take his concerns to the Soviets during his frequent visits to
                    Geneva.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>And let me talk for a moment here about the Observer Group. We had visitors
                    frequently during the first set of negotiations which ended with Soviet
                    walk-out. But when we came back in 1985, the Senate and then the House set up a
                    somewhat formal observer group. And Senator Stephens was a co-chair, as I said,
                    with Senator Nunn on the Senate side. I am pretty sure it was Senator Nunn; I am
                    positive about Senator Stevens. They would come over, at least once during every
                    round, and join us. I had an earlier experience with congressional staff that
                    made me really very leery of this operation at first. That experience, to
                    describe it just briefly, involved Senate and House staffers, joining us in a
                    negotiation—I think it was with Argentina. It was a bizarre sort of situation,
                    where the administration was negotiating with the Argentineans and the Senate
                    staffers were in the room. As the discussion began, the staffers joined in,
                    effectively becoming a part of the negotiation. It wasn't clear for whom they
                    were speaking. In fact, they began to argue among themselves, whether this or
                    that might be the result. It occurred to me at that point, this is why you have
                    an administration, an executive branch to do the negotiating, because the House
                    and the Senate are too large and too unwieldy bodies to conduct negotiation. As
                    I said, they were arguing among themselves in front of the Argentineans about
                    what they should be doing. As I said, it led me to a realization that this is a
                    dangerous approach. The INF Observer Groups, the Senate and House groups, never
                    did that. There was only one example, and I am not going to say who it was, when
                    they sort of said something and I felt it was injurious to the position that we
                    were taking. Otherwise, I thought that they were very helpful; they were not in
                    Geneva on vacation, they worked, we did not invite them to the plenary meetings,
                    but they had ample opportunities at receptions and at dinners to sit down with
                    the Soviet negotiators and discuss issues with them. Obviously, we would brief
                    them before every event, so that they would have an idea of where we were coming
                    from, where we were at in negotiations, what our goals were, how we would try
                    practically to move things. In this instance, I don't think there was ever,
                    except for that one exception early on, any problem. On the contrary, Senator
                    Stevens was very helpful. And I, in fact, encouraged him to make his concerns
                    known. He saw where we were coming from and where we were working together
                    towards the same goal. I think they played a useful role.</p>
                <p>Another item had occurred, which made dealing with the situation all the more
                    urgent. In August 1986, we had a series of meetings with the Soviets outside the
                    Geneva negotiations which involved people from capitals, Washington and Moscow,
                    and the chief negotiators on both the U.S. and Soviet side. The first meeting
                    was held in Moscow, and it was supposed to go through all three negotiations.
                    Let me just concentrate on the INF portion of it. The most important part of the
                    Moscow meeting was a question that General Chervov, who was the Soviet Defense
                    Ministry's lead individual for arms control, asked me. It sort of came out of
                    the blue; it didn't follow any sequence. He said, “Would you be willing to
                    accept an outcome in which there were 100 missiles left in Europe?” I had to
                    think about it for a moment, everyone looked at me because the question was
                    addressed to me and they expected me to answer. Fortunately I had a pretty good
                    idea at what point we still had a viable military force, so I went ahead and
                    said, “Yes.”</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>Then I asked him a couple of other question. The first one was, “We are talking
                    about U.S. and Soviet systems, but nobody else's, no British, no French?” And he
                    said, “That's correct.” Then I said, “Secondly, this is not going to impact
                    British or French in any way what so ever?” And they said, “Yes, that's
                    correct.” And I said, “Well then probably, we could work something out.”</p>
                <p>When we came back, the Reykjavik summit had been set up. We came back from
                    Moscow. We had preparation meetings, and I was able to say for INF that I
                    anticipated that we would hear from the Soviets something along these lines: 100
                    in Europe; and we'd have to determine what the right number would be for Asia.
                    My thinking was that it would have to be a proportional cut. So whatever
                    proportional cuts we took in Europe, the same proportion would be cut in Asia.
                    If it was a 50% cut in Europe, it would be a 50% cut in Asia; and we would have
                    to look at our own numbers to adjust accordingly. What happened in Reykjavik was
                    a variation on this. I won't go through the negotiation itself, between the
                    President and Gorbachev, Secretary of State Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister
                    Shevardnadze. But what came out of it was an agreement to have zero in Europe
                    and 100 elsewhere in the world. That was where they were. The problem at that
                    junction was that we didn't have anything in Asia. So that would have allowed
                    the Soviets to have that hundred but, for our part, we didn't have any
                    deployments planned, so we might find ourselves in a situation. There were
                    possibilities that it might be placed in Alaska, but that was also an issue that
                    hadn't been broached. We were certainly prepared when we got to Reykjavik to
                    deal with the number of 100 in Europe and leave open the question in Asia, but
                    it came as quite a surprise, I have to say, the way it worked out. We were ready
                    for something, but this twist was unusual. It was not anticipated by us. I am
                    not sure that it was anticipated by the Soviets either. This was Gorbachev just
                    moving in that direction. That left us with the question as to how we get down
                    to zero. I began to look around for ways for some kind of leverage that could
                    keep open the prospects of deployment somewhere in Asia, but that was not very
                    likely and there was the possibility of Alaska, but that was sort of lost in
                    several ways. Some of the positions that we had taken (and others had taken on
                    the fringes of the negotiation, concerning the possibility of our deployment in
                    Alaska) suggested that there was not any support. I think the Soviets were
                    probably aware of that. So we needed to find some other way.</p>
                <p>But the basic arrangement, especially the willingness to drop the British and
                    French systems that we heard from Chervov, struck me as really significant. This
                    was one of the toughest issues that we had faced in the negotiation and, at this
                    point, it looked as if this issue was now going to be resolved and in a way
                    which would not in fact put the British and French missiles on our side of the
                    ledger. So the issue now was could we get to global zero at this point. I have
                    already pointed out the advantages to us, verification simplification, etc. that
                    would flow if we could get a double, global zero.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>There were some other caveats that came at this point. The Soviets continued to
                    try to affect the mix between the GLCMS and Pershings and so on. We said that we
                    were prepared to discuss the mix, but Pershing was going to be part of the
                    force—one way or the other. I also went back to this, as I mentioned earlier we
                    tried this equal percentage reductions approach when this was done with Chervov,
                    but again when the President, Gorbachev, Shultz, and Shevardnadze were together
                    at Reykjavik, all that sort of got pushed aside and we were left with how to get
                    the remaining 100 out—what that would take. It occurred to me that there were
                    some pretty good arguments to deal with this problem. Around this time,
                    Gorbachev began a campaign to show that the Soviet Union wanted friendlier
                    relations with Asian countries, in particular with China. I, in effect, said to
                    Obukhov during some of the negotiating sessions, “You know, if you are taking a
                    position that you want to improve relations with Asia, then you really need to
                    take a good hard look at your position to keep 100 missiles in Asia and zero in
                    Europe. You know, it looks as if, in fact, you are favoring Europe over Asia.” I
                    wasn't too subtle about the way I phrased this. I wanted them to recognize that
                    there was an incompatibility there between seeking better relations and keeping
                    the 100 missiles.</p>
                <p>Let's pick up on getting rid of the remaining 100 missiles, which would have been
                    in Soviet Asia, while we would theoretically have been able to put some in
                    Alaska. There was a place in Alaska where cruise missiles could have reached
                    Soviet targets. Out aim was to try to get it down to zero. I kept pressing the
                    case for zero, noting that the world and especially the Asian nations would know
                    that it was the Soviet Union alone that was preventing the removal of the INF
                    threat from the region. And that everyone knew that we were ready to go to zero.
                    But the Soviets, I think, really had an abiding concern for the security
                    situation in Asia. That concern remained an impediment to an agreement to reach
                    global zero. So we began thinking about whether there was some kind of
                    additional sweetener which might provide an impetus to move to zero. And
                    fortuitously, one appeared—a little complicated, but here is the essence of
                    it.</p>
                <p>While we had agreed to zero level for LRINF in Europe, established patterns of
                    cooperation, sometimes called “patterns of cooperation,” or “POC,” involving
                    nuclear weapons provided to our allies were not affected. The argument we made
                    was that we have effectively signed contracts with our allies to support their
                    nuclear programs, that we provided them with nuclear weapons which they would
                    place on their airplanes or, in case of Germany, on their Pershing missiles, and
                    that these actions would bind us together in this nuclear world. It was a way of
                    sharing the responsibilities of being a nuclear power. And those
                    responsibilities included, obviously, being a target. That action linked the
                    U.S. strategic force directly to the Allies' nuclear forces. That was called the
                    “linkage” issue. And it was another way of assuring them that we were in it
                    together with them. That if there was going to be a war we would all be in it,
                    it wouldn't necessarily be fought only in Europe, and it would not only be
                    fought over the heads of Europeans. We would be in it together and that was how
                    we would deter it from happening because the Soviets would recognize that they
                    would have to take on the whole Alliance. In any case, that was really what
                    these patterns of cooperation involved.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>The Federal Republic of Germany had purchased and deployed U.S. manufactured
                    Pershing IA missiles, for which the U.S. provided nuclear warheads. It was
                    technically possible to upgrade a Pershing IA by converting the first stage of
                    the Pershing II missile into what would be called a Pershing IB. Pershing II had
                    two stages. Basically, you drop off the second stage and what you are left with
                    is another missile—a new missile which we would call Pershing IB. It would be
                    much longer in range than the IA, which was roughly I believe 700 kilometers,
                    less than 1,000 kilometers. Its improvement wouldn't be so much in range,
                    however, all the electronics would be new, and the guidance system would also be
                    new. It would be qualitatively an improved missile. And since under the INF
                    agreement we were going to have to destroy a lot of our Pershing IIs, all of
                    them would have to be destroyed if we went to zero globally, we had these
                    Pershing IIs there. Thus you can eliminate the missile—it ceases to exist by
                    removing that second stage and converting it to IB. We argued that this would be
                    elimination. There would be no more Pershing IIs.</p>
                <p>The Soviets didn't like that argument. They were quite concerned about the
                    Pershing IB. They let us know that position. Time and again they would raise it.
                    Our concern was that we were not going to upset the contract that we had with
                    the Germans, the POC, in a context of a bilateral negotiation. That contract had
                    been in effect for decades so we had a very delicate problem here. But the
                    Soviets were quite concerned about the PIB. So what I was looking at was some
                    way to put these things together. Their concern was the potential conversion;
                    ours was the desire to get zero LRINF missiles.</p>
                <p>In time we began to hear from the Germans that prospects for this conversion were
                    dim at best. And they were concerned for a number of reasons. First, they didn't
                    want to be singularized. In other words, they didn't want to be the only country
                    holding significant INF systems in Europe following an INF treaty. And second,
                    they didn't want to give the Soviet elements in their domestic body politic a
                    high profile focal point for attacking the government of the Federal Republic.
                    In other words, everyone else has gotten rid of their INF missiles; in such a
                    world, why are we still keeping ours in Germany? So you can see the political
                    pressures were there, not to go ahead and accept this PIB. Nevertheless the
                    Germans were going to be our good allies and certainly not damage either the
                    Alliance negotiating position or NATO's military posture should the INF
                    negotiations fail. We didn't want this issue to be a treaty breaker nor, I
                    believe, did the Germans want to open another debate over the deployment of
                    nuclear weapon system. If they were to remain a nuclear weapon power, their
                    missile force would, without conversion, be obsolete. The Pershing IA was
                    clearly obsolescent at this point. I don't want to say that it was useless or
                    ineffective, but it was not “state of the art.”</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>The near certainty that conversion would not take place seemed to me to provide
                    an opportunity to trade off our agreement to forgo conversion of the German
                    Pershing in return for a Soviet willingness to join us in a global zero. I
                    contacted Washington and laid out the basic proposition and suggested that I
                    float it past the Soviets as a personal idea, which at that point it was. If it
                    elicited interest we could follow up by making it more concrete, and if the
                    Soviets treated it as a non-starter we could drop it. And in any case, I could
                    be disowned. I got a general green light. I met with Obukhov around this time,
                    June 1, to be precise, of 1987. We had a conversation. He began to hint about
                    this, and I began to hint about it. It was clear to me that there were some
                    possibilities here. I asked him if he'd be prepared to go a little deeper on
                    some of the points he raised. He was interested to know whether we would also
                    agree not to convert the ground launched cruise missiles, the GLCM, to the sea
                    launched cruise missiles, the SLCM. At that point I said, “Are you ready to talk
                    informally now?” And he said, “Not yet.” So we couldn't go any further on that
                    discussion. He said he would make a sign when he was ready to go further.
                    Therefore, I took this as being possible.</p>
                <p>Shortly afterwards the Soviets told us that Colonel General Nikolai Chervov, I
                    think I mentioned him previously; he was the man who asked those questions about
                    100 missiles in Europe at the meeting in Moscow. They told us he'd be visiting
                    Geneva. This really provided an exceptional opportunity to put this concept
                    directly to a Moscow player. The first meeting I had with Chervov took place on
                    June 17. It was a luncheon meeting. General Medvedev was there, Ambassador
                    Obukhov was there, and John Woodworth on our side was with me. I think that was
                    the main group that we had there—plus the interpreters. The luncheon danced
                    around this issue. He was clearly interested in it. And, in fact, he kind of
                    raised it himself; he brought it up almost as I was going to do. So we kind of
                    came together on this. The sticking point was the German Pershings and POC. The
                    Soviets were quite opposed to allowing that program to continue; even if it had
                    been in existence for years. They felt that it was going to be unjust for
                    everyone to stop having these weapons except for the West Germans, who would be
                    able to have PIB if we insisted on the POC. Otherwise, it looked as if we would
                    be in a pretty good shape. That was a big stumbling block but the atmosphere was
                    good. My broad hints that we needed to find trade-offs were well received, as
                    were his. He said he would be leaving on Saturday, June 20, in the morning, and
                    would be prepared to talk again with me. I informed Washington about that
                    planned meeting and set up the talking points I intended to use for it. I was
                    given an informal go-ahead on a secure line, but told to expect a more
                    definitive and detailed response after the U.S. officials had an opportunity to
                    review the talking points more carefully.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>There was one comment that Chervov made during that discussion that amused me. He
                    said that the U.S. approach contains logic, and he said “I'm in favor of the
                    U.S. side.” I am not sure how to take that. Again, this was not an angry
                    meeting; this was one of the better ones we had. He did sum up his understanding
                    of our position as follows: zero globally on short range INF (I have not
                    discussed that here but that was also coming along); the U.S. would abandon
                    conversion for the U.S. of Pershing II to Pershing IB, but would maintain its
                    program of cooperation with the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
                <p>I hope that distinction is clear. We couldn't do it for ourselves, but we argued
                    that we had this existing contract, and we would fulfill it if we were asked to
                    do so by the Germans. And he said our position as he saw it was if the Germans
                    should ask for it, the U.S. could convert PIIs to PIBs.</p>
                <p>After we went over the PII to PIB conversion, we went through it again, and he
                    summed up the Soviet position this way: If the Soviet side were to accept the
                    double global zero, SRINF, LRINF, in other words, no missiles between 500 and
                    5,500 kilometers would exist, they would all be gone. If the Soviet side were to
                    accept the double global zero, U.S. must in turn physically destroy all PIIs, no
                    conversions and physically destroy all GLCMs, the ground launching cruise
                    missiles, with no conversion. He hinted the Soviets might be willing to accept
                    retention of the existing German PI missiles. As I said, at this point, he told
                    me, “I am leaving for Moscow on June 20, and let me know what you think.” But
                    you can see, we had a very general agreement. The sticking point was again about
                    the conversion of the German Pershing.</p>
                <p>I'll say a brief bit now about GLCMs and their “no conversion” issue. I was aware
                    of the fact that ground launch cruise missiles, which are covered by the INF
                    treaty, and the sea launched cruise missiles, which are not, were almost
                    identical. I won't go through how I knew this, but I had a visual proof of it on
                    one occasion, let's put it that way. What seemed to me to be a possible solution
                    to this problem, if we couldn't convert the whole missile, because we really
                    didn't want the Soviets going through a lot of conversions either, we might have
                    been suspicious of how those might have worked out, even with good verification,
                    monitoring, on-site inspection, etc., one thing we could do, and in the end we
                    did do, was to set up the elimination in such way that the exterior, the
                    airframe, would be crushed and destroyed, but everything inside, electronics,
                    the guidance system, obviously the warhead, the engine and the little rocket
                    motor at the back for missile which propelled it off the launcher in the first
                    place, all of those would be kept. And in the end we did that. We agreed that we
                    would destroy the airframe but we would keep all the innards. I was told by
                    someone that this arrangement, for us saved about 250 million dollars. It would
                    have been cheaper if we could convert whole thing, but that ran the risk of
                    having them do something of the sort themselves. That is how that eventually
                    worked its way out. I noted at the end of this luncheon meeting that the
                    farewell handshakes were heartier than usual.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>Anyway, I informed Washington of the other meeting, the planned meeting on
                    Saturday, and set out the talking points for me to use. Basically they outlined
                    how the thing should work. Which included the Soviets Union understands the U.S.
                    retains the right to continue this established pattern of cooperation with
                    Germans regarding the Pershing missiles. And that, if they would agree to that,
                    we would agree basically to get global double zero and we wouldn't transfer any
                    existing U.S. INF missiles to any third parties. Those that were actually in our
                    force, and PIIs, we wouldn't transfer but that did not happen, and of course we
                    kept open the idea of conversion. That was crucial in this issue. I was very
                    forceful, privately forceful I think too, that simply we were not going to break
                    a contract. We just could not accept an outcome in which that contract would be
                    broken unilaterally by us. That of course left it open if the Germans were to
                    say no. And that would be the end of it. Ultimately, a month or so later, in
                    August, I have the exact date somewhere here, Chancellor Kohl did say Germany
                    was not going to continue with this program. But that was further on.</p>
                <p>When I got to the U.S. mission on Saturday morning, I was told that there were no
                    messages for me. Chervov, accompanied by Lieutenant General Medvedev, the
                    official Soviet INF negotiator at that point, was at the door, and I decided to
                    proceed along the line that I had sent to Washington. I had gotten verbal
                    clearance over the phone. I would just proceed without a cable. It turned out in
                    fact that the message was in Geneva, but it was serving no practical purpose at
                    this point. We were still saddled with this combined delegation superstructure
                    we were talking about. The message had been given to the combined delegation
                    duty officer, who worked on the defense space group and had no knowledge of the
                    INF issues. It had been put aside for the combined delegation executive officer,
                    who would be in on Saturday, but who came in later in the morning. The message
                    gave me a green light to go ahead and called for only one relatively minor
                    change in the talking points.</p>
                <p>The discussion with Chervov was obviously very intense. Both in terms of the time
                    constraints and the need to get our figures worked out. I reiterated our
                    arguments for double global zero. And made the point once more that we were
                    aware of Soviet concern over the modernization of German Pershing IA force, and
                    he saw where I was heading and that it might be possible to reach a solution to
                    both of the problems—that we have a trade-off. I also took the occasion to put
                    forward the concept of destroying the airframes and keeping the innards, so to
                    speak, of the missiles. He didn't have any specific reaction to that but, as I
                    said, eventually they did accept it. At the same time, I suggested the both
                    sides would make it clear that neither would transfer to third countries any
                    existing U.S. or Soviet LRINF or SRINF missiles, and that meant those in the
                    force now. And this would include the Federal Republic. However, I made it
                    equally clear that it was a matter of principle for the U.S. that the German
                    Pershings were not part of this agreement. We would retain the right to continue
                    the established pattern of cooperation for the Pershing systems. However, I did
                    say I did not envisage that support for that program would go beyond the
                    framework of the existing pattern. In other words, the numbers would not change
                    and the types wouldn't change.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>Chervov again expressed concern over the possibility that under what I had
                    proposed, the U.S. had the right to convert the PII to PIB for the West Germans.
                    He believed that his authorities would find this difficult to accept since it
                    would be seen as an inequity. Having laid out our respective positions, we both
                    came to an informal agreement, stressing that we were speaking informally and
                    unofficially. There would be Soviet commitment to eliminate the remaining INF
                    systems in Asia, in essence a double global zero and the U.S. would not convert
                    any of its PIIs into PIBs. The Soviets could accept the retention of the
                    existing German PIA force. The one part of which we had to agree to disagree
                    concerned the continued application of the U.S. pattern of cooperation with the
                    Germans. I made it clear that we would not abandon that arrangement without
                    German agreement. Chervov commented that this would pose a major difficulty for
                    the Soviet side. Nevertheless I think we both understood that each of us would
                    present the informal agreement to our respective capitals. As I bid farewell to
                    Chervov, I was more confident than ever that we would get a sound and durable
                    INF agreement, incorporating the principles we had worked out with our NATO
                    allies back in 1979. As it was, that confidence would soon be tested.</p>
                <p>What happened there was that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, Yuri Vorontsov and
                    Ambassador Max Kampelman came to Geneva about the time Chervov had left. On June
                    23, John Woodworth and I met with Vorontsov, Obukhov, and Medvedev. Vorontsov
                    had been rather pessimistic and negative, and in response I noted that we made
                    progress during Chervov's visit and expressed a hope that we could move further
                    with Vorontsov. When I outlined the discussion with Chervov, Vorontsov exploded.
                    “Decisions on such issues are made by us in the Foreign Ministry and not in the
                    Defense Ministry,” he said. “Chervov's views and suggestions are not our policy
                    and have no standing.” Neither Medvedev, who had been present during my
                    conversation with Chervov, nor Obukhov, who had been present at the luncheon
                    meeting with Chervov, made any comment. Both carefully controlled their body
                    language. Well, despite, or perhaps even more, because of Vorontsov's reaction I
                    concluded that of the two, Chervov's was the more authentic voice. In any event,
                    we continued our efforts to move the Soviets to accept our global zero approach
                    and patiently awaited developments. Again, I have to underscore how strongly we
                    made the point that we had these agreements with the Germans and, while we
                    wouldn't be converting for ourselves, we had to retain the right to continue
                    that pattern of cooperation. We could not unilaterally remove it. And that was
                    obviously a very serious sticking point for them. It eventually got
                    resolved.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>On July 22, we got our answer. One of my staff came into my office and said,
                    “There is an article here that you need to see right away. It's an Indonesian
                    newspaper, Merdeka.” I thought to myself, “I know what this is.” It was
                    Gorbachev's acceptance of double global zero. He sought to present it as his own
                    and as a Soviet contribution to improving security in Asia. His choice of an
                    Asian newspaper I believe was also meant to send an obvious message.
                    Nevertheless, the incompatibility between his call for closer Soviet-Asian ties
                    and Soviet insistence on keeping SS-20s targeted on most of Asia had forced the
                    change in Soviet policy. He simply couldn't argue in favor of closer relations
                    and then maintain the SS-20s. That had forced the change. As well as, I hope,
                    some of our efforts to give him further reasons to move forward in this area;
                    including, bringing this incompatibility to their attention.</p>
                <p>The next day in Geneva, the Soviets formally tabled the proposal outlined in the
                    Merdeka interview. The Soviets, however, made agreement contingent on the
                    inclusion not of the new Pershings, but of the old Pershings IA in an INF
                    agreement. Now, suddenly this arises. Our argument was that these were German
                    Pershings and not ours; we had basically sold them to them. We did have the
                    warheads. But they then began to argue that the existing German Pershings should
                    go under any U.S.-Soviet INF treaty.</p>
                <p>After the formal session, Obukhov took me aside and expressed the Soviet
                    expectation that we would now follow through on the accord reached with Chervov.
                    I knew that we had been in close contact with the Germans on the issue of
                    conversion, conversion was not in the cards, and I said it will work out. On the
                    other hand, I said the existing German PIA would have to remain outside any
                    U.S.-Soviet agreement. I had trouble trying, well not trouble, but I began to
                    question why Vorontsov had reacted the way he did. And it makes me wonder
                    whether there was simply not full coordination within the Soviet bureaucracy.
                    It's also possible that Vorontsov may have been aware that something like the
                    Merdeka article was underway within the Soviet government and he felt that
                    getting into the issue, in the way that Chervov had, would make it look as if
                    the U.S. had some role in this move.</p>
                <p>In any case, I would put down my conversations with Chervov as win-win on both
                    sides. The Soviets would avoid the risk of a modern NATO-FRG nuclear missile
                    force. We'd get the global zero that we sought to benefit of ourselves, our
                    Asian and NATO allies, and both parties would gain from the improved prospect
                    for effective verification that the zero outcome would create. I have explained
                    why the verification would be easier.</p>
                <p>If you look back at this juncture in the negotiations, we had obtained the zero
                    outcome, which President Reagan had made his primary goal six years earlier. We
                    had secured Soviet agreement to the NATO principles, which had guided us from
                    1979. We had obtained Soviet recognition of the legitimacy of U.S. deployments
                    of nuclear weapons in Europe. And by extension, we had obtained their acceptance
                    of our military presence in Europe as a counter to Soviet deployments
                    threatening our NATO allies. Additionally, we had defended the interests of our
                    Asian allies by obtaining the elimination of the Soviet INF threat against
                    them.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>We have talked a little bit about the short range INF systems, and I think it
                    would now be a good time to discuss the evolution of that aspect of the
                    negotiations. I think, as I pointed out, we had started by asking for collateral
                    constraints, not otherwise specified, on those systems, both Soviet and U.S.,
                    their ranges were 500-1,000 kilometers, and I think there we and the Soviets
                    reached agreement pretty quickly. We listed some systems, specifically the
                    SS-23, which they at first claimed did not exist. They eventually agreed it did
                    exist but then claimed it could not reach 500 kilometers and should, therefore,
                    be kept out of the treaty. Those were sort of the main parameters of it. We had
                    very few of these types of missile systems, although there was always a
                    possibility of building some. We did have shorter range missiles with ranges
                    below 500 kilometers in Europe. And we had artillery. Again, we had a large
                    number of nuclear weapons there; the value of some of them, frankly, I
                    questioned when I was in the Army early in my career. But, in any case, these
                    were all being removed from the inventory. And by now are all out of the
                    inventory.</p>
                <p>From the beginning, we realized we would have to constrain Soviet missiles with
                    ranges below 1,000 kilometers because from bases in East Germany they could
                    strike well into West Germany and possibly some of the other neighboring
                    countries. Therefore, they were as effective for the Soviets as their INF
                    missiles in certain situations. As you see, we didn't have anything quite like
                    it. The Soviet rationale for the 1,000 kilometers was that this was how much
                    capability it would take to reach from West German bases to Soviet territory (a
                    round trip in case of aircraft); that is where that number came from. It made
                    sense just in general terms as a good point at which to break off short range
                    INF and move into longer range INF systems.</p>
                <p>Throughout most of these early days, SRINF was not a major consideration, but as
                    we got closer to the end of negotiations, as we began to make progress on other
                    areas, of course then SRINF moved up to be a more important factor. This issue
                    really got moving during a meeting—a luncheon in Geneva with Viktor Karpov. This
                    session would have been in spring of 1987. I have the exact date somewhere but,
                    in any case, Karpov, a senior Foreign Ministry arms control official, joined us
                    for a working lunch. During that lunch I believe Ambassador Kampelman and, at
                    that point, probably Ambassador Lehman also were present along with our Soviet
                    counterparts. During that lunch, I took the opportunity to raise SRINF.
                    Essentially I put down a marker that we remained determined to constrain SRINF
                    as part of any agreement. Karpov responded (and this in presence of Vorontsov
                    and other Soviet negotiators) that if SRINF issue represents an obstacle to an
                    early INF accord, the Soviet side would be prepared to eliminate SRINF at the
                    same time as LRINF missiles are reduced to 100 warheads globally and eliminated
                    in Europe. When I asked what Soviet systems he was referring to, Karpov
                    indicated the “Scale Board” also known as the SS-12/22, and the SS-23, which, as
                    I said, until fairly recently at that point, the Soviets had argued did not
                    exist. They now recognized that it existed, and not only that it existed but
                    Karpov was saying it would be included in the elimination.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>While noting that a global outcome, rather than retaining the 100 warheads, would
                    be the most appropriate result, I urged Karpov to come to Geneva more often with
                    proposals of this sort. It was noteworthy here that neither Karpov nor the other
                    Soviets made reference to the statement Gorbachev had made on February 28, in
                    which Gorbachev had suggested a zero SRINF outcome. Around this time and after
                    Reykjavik, we began to wonder what was happening in Moscow. We began to have a
                    sense that there was some lack of communication. You can't help but wonder. Look
                    at what happened here!</p>
                <p>The Soviet leader Gorbachev puts forward a proposal on February 28: zero SRINF.
                    His senior Foreign Ministry officials are unable to discuss it in any detail
                    with us when we asked them about it. And yet one of them floats a trial balloon,
                    a proposal similar to that their president had made in public only days before
                    but about which they seemed rather uninformed. Nonetheless, there was something
                    about Karpov's presentation that led me to conclude that it was serious. In
                    fact, while I didn't state that for obvious reasons, I had misgivings about the
                    effect of Karpov's trial balloon on NATO's internal relations. The prospect of
                    removing all U.S. SRINF from Europe could be seen as a major Soviet interest
                    insofar as it could be a major step towards a Soviet goal of eliminating—
                    undermining rather—the linkage or the strategic interest of the U.S. and the
                    European NATO members. U.S. nuclear capable aircraft would remain in Europe (the
                    Soviets had dropped their effort to include aircraft back in the fall of 1985),
                    but they would not provide the same amount of deterrent value as the missiles.
                    Unlike the missiles, the aircraft had conventional roles and would encounter
                    Soviet aircraft. Considering that the leaders in Europe had been in the
                    forefront of supporting the U.S. INF approach, and who had considered the
                    maintenance of the U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe crucial to their countries'
                    security, they were likely to raise concerns over a double zero outcome.
                    Karpov's hint carried with it, therefore, the potential for a serious NATO
                    debate on how to respond. In addition to the potential of stirring up
                    disagreement in NATO, Karpov might have had another motivation for trotting out
                    a possible zero level SRINF outcome. The Soviets saw both political and military
                    advantage in stopping the conversion of PII to PIB, and, therefore, this was
                    another way of getting at that objective. As I pointed out, there were some
                    values, economic and military, attractions I should say, for conversion. We've
                    been through this so I won't go any further in that topic. But I thought that it
                    was a factor in their mind. We did our best to make sure the Soviets understood
                    that there would be no agreement without constraints on SRINF and, at this
                    point, in March 1987, I went on the David Brinkley show, “This Week with David
                    Brinkley,” and was asked about SRINF. I said it that was a sine qua non for a
                    solid agreement. We would not have an agreement which did not include this. I
                    made similar remarks during a press briefing held at the White House on March 6
                    and carried by USIA to European diplomatic posts.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>Over the next two or three weeks, Karpov's hot air balloon seemed to float away.
                    Soviet negotiators didn't broach the subject or respond to our careful probing.
                    Bonn, however, was growing restive over SRINF. German officials were
                    increasingly concerned both over the prospect of Germany's deploying modernized
                    PIA missiles and conversely concerned about the possibility of zero level for
                    U.S. SRINF in Europe. The reaction of German officials at NATO meetings that I
                    attended to brief them on Karpov's trial balloon led me to suggest a visit to
                    Bonn to explain the situation directly at cabinet level meetings.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>On March 30, accompanied by John Woodworth, I met separately with Foreign
                    Minister Genscher, Defense Minister W�rner, and German Socialist Party Bundestag
                    Group Deputy Chairman Horst Emka. W�rner was in solid support of the Alliance,
                    of the deployment of Pershing II and GLCM in Germany, and of our negotiating
                    position. I explained to him that I believed Karpov's zero level SRINF trial
                    balloon could well be serious and that, while it was not being pressed by the
                    Soviets, we needed to prepare for a formal introduction. The problem, I
                    acknowledged, was that accepting zero SRINF could be construed as a step towards
                    ultimate elimination of all U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe, with the clear
                    implication that the linkage between NATO European defense and U.S. nuclear
                    forces could be seriously weakened, if not broken. The potential fracture could,
                    however, be mitigated if NATO moved ahead to modernize its remaining short range
                    nuclear forces, that is weapons with ranges below 500 kilometers. I pointed out
                    that this could be accomplished by deploying a follow-on to the surface to
                    surface LANCE missile, which was called FOTL. And a new air to surface missile,
                    TASM, that is Tactical Air to Surface Missile. On the other hand, if we did not
                    accept the zero level for the SRINF, we would certainly incur criticism for
                    having turned down the Soviet offer to go to zero and at the same time we would
                    need to modernize NATO's SRINF. Not to modernize would place us at a military
                    and political/psychological disadvantage vis-�-vis the Soviets. And there was
                    the problem. We would have turned down an offer for an equal zero, an outcome at
                    zero, and willingly accepted an unequal outcome, providing the Soviets with a
                    distinct advantage. If we didn't do anything, there would be an unequal outcome.
                    The alternative there would be to start building up. We would have been left
                    holding obsolete systems, solely in German hands, if we turned this proposal
                    down. And the ability of the Alliance to deter Soviet political intimidation and
                    aggression would be greatly weakened. W�rner responded by arguing that the
                    negative sides of moving to zero SRINF would have more serious consequences than
                    turning down any Soviet offer. Zero SRINF on top of the zero already agreed on
                    LRINF would negatively affect the linkage with U.S. strategic systems and hence
                    between the U.S. and other member of the Alliance. I am going over this again,
                    so you can see the nature of this issue. It was a situation where we did not
                    have a perfect answer. If we relied on SRINF alone, W�rner argued, to provide
                    the linkage that position would have the major disadvantage of leaving Germany
                    particularly exposed and singled out as a potential nuclear battlefield. At the
                    same time, he questioned any possibility of modernizing NATO's SRINF if we
                    turned down the zero offer. I told him that we understood and shared the German
                    concerns. The logic of the situation made it very difficult to defend refusing a
                    Soviet offer to move to zero SRINF but not to take steps to update U.S. and NATO
                    SRINF systems in an environment where SRINF would remain present. We parted
                    amicably, but it was clear that there had not been a complete meeting of the
                    minds and that further discussion would be required.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>Genscher for his part stressed the importance of completing an INF treaty along
                    the lines agreed in Reykjavik or calling for immediate follow-on negotiations on
                    SRINF, which he called a paramount interest of the German government. At the end
                    of the day, it seemed increasingly likely to me that, if the Soviets adopted a
                    zero SRINF position and we turned it down, we would find ourselves both unable
                    to deploy SRINF to match the Soviets and in an indefensible position back home.
                    Under the circumstances, a zero SRINF outcome, with some prospect of upgrading
                    remaining shorter range nuclear forces, was probably the best outcome. While
                    this outcome would leave the U.S. and its NATO allies with the least desirable
                    nuclear systems in Europe, missiles and artillery with ranges below 500
                    kilometers and air-delivered weapons, it would still pack a punch and provoke
                    visible evidence of the linkage between NATO and the U.S. nuclear deterrent. But
                    we first had to persuade W�rner and his cabinet colleagues of this judgment.</p>
                <p>Well, it turned out we were not going to have much time to do this. A day after
                    visiting Bonn, I went back to Washington and began to help preparations for
                    meetings in Moscow between Secretary Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister
                    Shevardnadze. It was obvious that INF was certainly going to be on the agenda. I
                    emphasized that we might be confronted at that meeting with the Soviet zero
                    SRINF proposal and that we would have to move very carefully, given the German
                    concerns. I reinforced these points during the pre-ministerial meetings, which
                    were held in Helsinki prior to going to Moscow.</p>
                <p>In fact, as we anticipated, SRINF was a prominent element at the April 14, 1987,
                    Moscow ministerial meeting. I think Secretary Shultz raised the topic during the
                    meeting with Gorbachev. The Soviet leader first suggested that Soviets would
                    withdraw nuclear systems in East Germany and Czechoslovakia and that both sides
                    would then freeze SRINF levels. Secretary Shultz responded by citing our
                    cardinal principle: any agreement must be based on an equal outcome and a freeze
                    at current levels would not be equal. Gorbachev then suggested the SRINF be
                    treated in the same manner as was agreed at Reykjavik for LRINF. Zero in Europe
                    and 100 in Soviet Asia and the U.S. The Secretary rejected this approach, and he
                    pointed out that these missiles can be moved rather easily. And he added that
                    the only sensible outcome is equality on a global basis. Finally, Gorbachev
                    proposed a global zero. Secretary Shultz was well aware of the sensitivities
                    with our Allies and made it clear he would have to consult with the Allies
                    before responding to Gorbachev's offer.</p>
                <p>Well, we were scheduled to meet with our NATO allies in Brussels directly after
                    the meeting in Moscow. I had been working on other issues; obviously, during the
                    ministerial, I had been busy, but I wrote up talking points for the Secretary on
                    the airplane as we flew to Brussels. Essentially, I used the arguments that I
                    had used with Defense Minister W�rner to form the basis of the talking points.
                    We could accept global zero for SRINF or an equal finite number for both sides,
                    but to accept an outcome in which we turn down a Soviet offer for a global zero
                    for SRINF while not deploying modern SRINF on our side, would create a military
                    imbalance, a politically indefensible result. If NATO did not accept zero then
                    it must deploy SRINF to match the Soviets.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>I had some interesting times with this paper. As we flew to Moscow I had cleared
                    it with the Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, Roz
                    Ridgway, several other members of the party, and Richard Pearle. Pearle was busy
                    working on a message of his own, but once we got to Brussels I showed him this,
                    and he gave a quick green light. We were in a hotel at this point. I went ahead
                    and took it to the secretaries that would come with Secretary Shultz and went
                    ahead and asked them to type up the paper and have it ready for the Secretary to
                    read the next morning. I thought I'd go to bed. In Moscow, we had gone around
                    the clock a couple of days so I was ready to sleep. But in not too long a time,
                    I got a call from Charlie Thomas, who was at that point the Director of State
                    Department's NATO office, and a good friend. Unfortunately, he is now gone.
                    Charlie said, “You'd better get back downstairs to the delegation's office. A
                    group of officials who had just joined the party had taken the talking points
                    paper from the Secretariat Staff and were arguing that its entire premise was
                    wrong and that it had to be entirely rewritten.” So I went down there. There was
                    a sort of intellectual turmoil. These new arrivals were insisting that the zero
                    offer must be turned down because it would undermine nuclear linkage and the
                    overall deterrent. As for the considerable likelihood that Germany and other
                    allies would not support deployment of new U.S. SRINF, they argued it would be
                    sufficient to leave open the possibility of deployment at some future time. In
                    other words, our unexercised right to deploy would balance the existing Soviet
                    force. I went over the argument with the folks there. But before any conclusion
                    could be reached, it was announced that a press backgrounder, which Ridgway was
                    asked to give, would be held in a few minutes. I guess the lure of seeing or
                    being seen by the media proved more powerful than dealing with the SRINF issue.
                    The crowd, Richard Pearle aside, surged towards the doors. I looked at a way to
                    bar the exit and said something like “Look we need to wrap up the paper for the
                    secretary now.” Ridgway said, “I've already cleared the draft.” Others in effect
                    said they would leave their proxy with Richard Pearle, and they made for the
                    media. Once they left the room, Richard and I sat down and went over the paper.
                    As I've said, we had already gone over it once before. He made a couple more
                    suggestions, which didn't affect the substance and which I readily accepted. By
                    the time the others had returned, the paper was retyped and back with the
                    Secretary's staff, awaiting delivery. And Secretary Shultz used the paper to
                    good affect. The Germans, as expected and understandably, agonized at length
                    over the decision. In the end, they and the other Allies recognized that the
                    global zero SRINF outcome was in NATO's overall interest, it presaged global
                    zero for INF, and it would make verification easier and relatively more certain
                    in verifying the final number. On the other hand, going to zero did, as I
                    pointed out in my Brinkley Show interview, carried with it, or required that,
                    “to ensure that the remaining nuclear weapons in Europe are high-tech.” This
                    reflected my concern that we needed to lay the groundwork for such action in
                    order to meet concerns of those Europeans who believed an INF agreement would
                    undermine linkage and deterrence and my uneasiness over the prospects for
                    obtaining broad enough European support for the deployment of such systems. The
                    uneasiness was intensified by growing signs that a there would be a follow-on
                    SNF negotiation, with the possibility of pressure for another third zero outcome
                    could be in the offing if we succeeded in INF. Genscher's call for follow-on
                    negotiation certainly strengthened the prospect of another round—if not this
                    outcome. Remember, the Cold War was still a factor at this time. Therefore,
                    there was the prospect of the removal of all U.S. nuclear forces from Europe
                    while the Soviet Union would continue to hold European cities hostage to its
                    remaining strategic nuclear forces—these were not going away. And the effect
                    that outcome would have on our ability to deter Soviet attack on the Alliance
                    was not particularly agreeable to contemplate. But there would still be some
                    more obstacles on SRINF before we would reach that point. All of these obstacles
                    would be interrelated and Germany figured prominently in all of them.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>On June 1, 1987, the Germans informed the U.S. that they were prepared to accept
                    a global zero level SRINF outcome. The NATO ministerial meeting in Reykjavik on
                    June 12 put the Alliance on that decision, and we tabled it in Geneva on June 16
                    as a formal U.S. proposal for SRINF. Thus at this point, the U.S. and the Soviet
                    Union had reached an agreement on an INF treaty which would eliminate all INF
                    missiles except the 100 Soviet LRINF in the Asian part of Russia and 100 U.S.
                    LRINF missiles on U.S. territory. We appeared close to reaching an agreement on
                    eliminating SRINF on a global basis.</p>
                <p>That same NATO ministerial meeting in Reykjavik on June 12, in its communiqu�
                    called for “adequate and effective” U.S. nuclear forces in Europe. This was
                    meant to be a clear signal that modern U.S. SNF systems should remain in Europe
                    even if a double global zero INF treaty was successfully negotiated. As Prime
                    Minister Thatcher put it, “A firebreak was thus in place to ensure that zero
                    would not be extended to cover all U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe.” However,
                    while conservative Germans supported this approach as essential for maintaining
                    deterrence, other Germans believed that, as they would put it, “the shorter the
                    missile, the deader the German.” In this climate, support was growing stronger
                    in favor of a new negotiation to cover SNF. No doubt Mrs. Thatcher would not
                    have been happy with that. But at this juncture, the Soviets began turning the
                    spot-light of their public attention to those German Pershing-IAs, these are the
                    old, obsolescent missiles that I discussed previously. Chervov, in effect, had
                    said, “Let them keep them if they want. You just can't convert them or improve
                    them.” What led the Soviets to do this was I suspect a treaty outcome more to
                    their liking and the prospect of exacerbating divisiveness within, among the
                    allied nations. What was the situation?</p>
                <p>At the time of the 1979 INF decision, the Germans had 72 PIA missiles. Like their
                    108 U.S. PIA counterparts, they had been first deployed in 1962. We saw the 1979
                    decision as calling for the modernization on a one-for-one basis of 108 U.S.
                    Pershing IA to Pershing II. These, of course, were going to disappear with the
                    signing of the INF treaty. But the modernization involved more than this, and
                    this point gets us back to the value of conversion, and the modernization
                    included other important improvements. But we have already seen that it was not
                    going to be possible to convert. That still left these old PIAs. And there were
                    72 of them at this point. Their range was substantively within the definition of
                    a SRINF missile. But they weren't U.S.-owned and controlled; they were outside
                    the scope of a bilateral U.S.-Soviet INF agreement.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>The Soviets however, had other ideas. They began increasingly to bring up what
                    they considered the anomaly in maintaining any missiles with INF ranges in
                    Germany. They tabled a draft treaty on April 23, 1987, which contained a
                    proposal to include American warheads on the German Pershings as part of the
                    agreement. Obukhov, during private meetings with me in early June, because we
                    were getting into this conversion issue, made a specific point of arguing that
                    the retention of the German Pershings would put the Soviet Union and its Warsaw
                    Pact allies at a distinct disadvantage, because none of them would have a
                    comparable system. This is going to lead to an issue in the future, that is, the
                    point that neither the Soviet Union nor its Warsaw Pact allies had a comparable
                    system.</p>
                <p>Our side objected to this position, noting that we had made clear that these
                    patterns of cooperation would not be affected by any agreement. We couldn't
                    accept an agreement with them that had that sort of an effect. I also pointed
                    out that the Soviet negotiators told us they had no existing programs of
                    cooperation with their Warsaw Pact allies, and Obukhov continued to argue that
                    the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact would be at a disadvantage because they didn't
                    have anything similar to the German Pershings. I noted that the Soviets were not
                    restricted to their SRINF or LRINF missiles when it came to targeting NATO
                    Europe. I was of course referring to the strategic systems. On one occasion,
                    Obukhov cited the Soviet agreement to eliminate its SS-23 missiles as a factor
                    in their view that the retention of German Pershings would put the Warsaw Pact
                    at a disadvantage. As we know, the Soviets had fought hard to keep the SS-23 out
                    of the INF agreement. And the arguing was over range. In the end, it was
                    Gorbachev personally, who made the decision to include the SS-23, and, as we
                    shell see, that decision may have had historic consequences.</p>
                <p>Following the April ministerial meeting in Moscow, Gorbachev included the SS-23.
                    We'd seen that Karpov had earlier included it. At this April meeting with
                    Secretary Shultz, Gorbachev specified that the SS-23 would be a part of the
                    agreement. Nevertheless, although Gorbachev had done it, Soviet officials that
                    we dealt with were rather unhappy that their leadership had agreed to the
                    inclusion of the SS-23. And they would raise it from time to time as a
                    concession. We know now that in fact it was not very popular with Soviet
                    officials. We have found that from Soviet sources that it was seen as a great
                    mistake by Gorbachev. It might account for some of what we saw were
                    inconsistencies, at least in timing if not in content, between things we would
                    hear from Gorbachev and then, only after a time, were picked up by the Soviet
                    negotiators.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>On August 6, 1987, Shevardnadze raised the issue of the German Pershings at
                    length, in a sometimes impassioned speech that he gave to the UN in Geneva. He
                    called the German Pershings “the main snag” preventing the conclusion of an INF
                    agreement. He argued that the agreement to global double zero must include all
                    U.S. and Soviet INF, including those on the old IA Pershing missiles that the
                    Germans had. But if the U.S. does not want the zero option, as it's clear from
                    its present 72-0 formula, that would be a different ball game. He was really
                    upset by this. And Shevardnadze also said, similar to what Obukhov was saying,
                    “We too have allies; we are concerned over the fact that the Germans are going
                    to maintain the shorter range missiles which would pose a threat to their
                    security.” He was quite concerned about the Germans being able to keep these
                    systems. With this argument Shevardnadze neatly twisted the facts to make it
                    appear that Germany and the U.S. were colluding to turn Germany into a nuclear
                    power. They were putting maximum pressure on the German government, and
                    Shevardnadze placed the full burden on reaching an INF agreement on Germany's
                    giving up its Pershing IA missiles. Once again, you can see the intense Soviet
                    desire to use those negotiations to create dissension within Germany, and
                    between Germany and the other Allies. It had been a hallmark of the Soviet
                    approach to the INF from the outset. This issue continued to fester for about 20
                    more days and then on August 26, 1987, Chancellor Kohl put it to rest by
                    announcing Germany would eliminate its PIA missiles after the INF treaty was
                    signed. With PIA missiles gone, it was only logical for the U.S. to state it
                    would withdraw their nuclear warheads.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>You would think the Soviets would leave it at that. But they were not content to
                    do so. I mean, they had gotten what they wanted. They argued that the
                    disposition of the German Pershings and their warheads must be made an integral
                    part of any INF treaty. I objected that the treaty was strictly bilateral in
                    nature, no other country was a party to it, and no other country's missile
                    systems could be made a part of it. Nevertheless, the Soviets continued to press
                    their demands in Geneva and raised it in Washington on September 17, during a
                    ministerial level meeting chaired by Shultz and Shevardnadze. The Soviet foreign
                    minister pushed exceptionally hard on this point. Frank Carlucci, who had become
                    President's Reagan National Security Advisor, came out of the meeting with
                    Shevardnadze, and told me that the issue has become a major obstacle to reaching
                    an agreement. The Soviets felt that without some formal mention in the agreement
                    with us that the warheads on the German Pershings would be removed from Europe,
                    they would have no legal basis for a complaint that the U.S. was not in
                    compliance with the treaty if we did not withdraw the warheads from the German
                    Pershings. Carlucci asked if it would be possible to meet the Soviets' concerns
                    by including some mention of the warheads on the German Pershings in the treaty.
                    The effort to keep third party systems out of the INF issue had been a critical
                    component of our position, and we had not budged on it, recognizing that to do
                    so would open the way for the Soviets to argue that British and French nuclear
                    forces should be included on the U.S. side of the ledger. It would undercut our
                    key philosophical point. An INF treaty must lead to an equal outcome for the
                    U.S. and the Soviet Union. While it bothered me to have to move even a
                    millimeter towards the Soviets on this issue, I recognized that neither Shultz
                    nor Carlucci would raise the possibility if they had not judged the solution was
                    essential to the conclusion of a treaty, which would meet all the basic goals of
                    the U.S. and its NATO allies that we set out to achieve in December 1979. I told
                    Carlucci we should not make any reference to the Germans Pershings and the U.S.
                    warheads in the treaty, but I did think I could find a place to indirectly refer
                    to them in one of the treaty annexes.</p>
                <p>Shortly thereafter, Karpov and I were called to join the ministers. We went there
                    and they instructed us to find some place in the formal documents, which we were
                    preparing in Geneva, in which to refer to the problem posed by the German
                    Pershings and their U.S. warheads. Having known what to expect, I had already
                    located the place and prepared the words to accomplish this task. When Karpov
                    and I convened, I suggested that the protocol on elimination would be
                    appropriate place to refer to the elimination of the U.S. or Soviet re-entry
                    vehicles on INF missiles owned by other countries, which had by unilateral
                    decision of those countries, been released from an existing protocol of
                    cooperation. There was no specific reference to German Pershings. This section
                    was drafted in a manner which made it applicable to both sides. It also
                    accommodated the treaty requirement that the U.S. and the Soviet Union eliminate
                    all of their INF missile systems 15 days prior to the end of the overall period
                    of elimination. This was a rather convoluted procedure, but it was required so
                    that the U.S. could withdraw the re-entry vehicles, which had been placed on the
                    German Pershings, to the U.S. for elimination before the elimination period
                    called for in the treaty. Karpov and I reported back to the ministers and they
                    agreed with our proposal. The wording was subsequently included in the
                    appropriate part of the treaty, Section 2, Paragraph 9 of the Protocol on
                    Elimination, and implemented accordingly.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>Now we come to another incident. Three years before the elimination period had
                    run its course, an eliminated SRINF system, the SS-23 returned to prominence. As
                    foretold by the June 27 NATO ministerial meeting, the U.S. and its Allies began
                    the process of modernizing the remaining SNF in Europe. These systems had been
                    reduced in numbers over the course of the INF negotiations in Europe, in part
                    because of obsolescence and in part in order to underscore our bona fides in
                    arms control. The modernization plans called for an improved artillery warhead,
                    a Follow On to the LANCE Missile, FOTL, and a new surface to air missile, the
                    tactical air to surface missile or TASM. As anticipated, these plans were seen
                    as essential by some of our European allies and contrary to the INF spirit by
                    others.</p>
                <p>As this modernization process became controversial, the Soviets once again geared
                    up their propaganda machine, seeing in this issue yet a new opportunity to split
                    the Alliance. Gorbachev's popularity was high, and his call for “common European
                    home” seemed to resonate with many Germans. Soviet spokesmen began to attack
                    NATO modernization plans. Ambassador Kvitsinsky, who was then Soviet Ambassador
                    to Bonn, likened the proposed FOTL missile as going beyond modernization,
                    because the Soviets under the INF treaty sacrificed their comparable SS-23, so
                    that weapons of this kind would disappear completely from Europe. He said, “If
                    NATO now builds a missile that has a range of perhaps 20 or 50 (kilometers) less
                    than our SS-23, this is a fraud.” More impressive was a comment by Marshall of
                    the Soviet Union, Akhromeyev, which aired in Pravda on April 19th. He said,
                    “NATO leaders are claiming that the Soviet Union and the countries of the Warsaw
                    Pact as a whole, while opposing the so-called modernization of NATO's tactical
                    nuclear missiles,” that is SNF, “have themselves already carried out such a
                    modernization of their own missiles and are misleading the public in an effort
                    to align it against the NATO block. The reality is that the Warsaw Pact armies
                    are equipped with missiles created between 15 and 27 years ago. It is true that
                    the Soviet Army has a modern missile with a range of up to 500 kilometers. It is
                    the SS-23 missile, being eliminated in accordance with the INF treaty. The
                    Soviet Union deliberately took this step so there would be no more nuclear
                    missiles of this range in any country. Now, however, completely unembarrassed by
                    the fact that the U.S. representatives at the talks sought the elimination of
                    the SS-23 missile, the U.S. intends to deploy in Europe a modernized LANCE
                    nuclear missile with a range up to 450 kilometers, virtually identical to the
                    range of the Soviet SS-23 missile being eliminated.”</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>Well, what happened? On March 6, 1990, a news report from Germany revealed that
                    the Soviet Union had provided SS-23 missiles to East Germany, Czechoslovakia,
                    and Bulgaria. With the GDR collapsing, the secret was out of the bag. My
                    immediate reaction was one of anger at Soviet duplicity and concern that the
                    U.S. had not unearthed these developments during the course of the negotiations.
                    Upon reflection, I recalled the several conversations that I had with Obukhov,
                    which I have just recounted, in which he argued that the Soviet Union and the
                    Warsaw Pact would be at a disadvantage if the Germans kept their PIA force since
                    they had no comparable missile. I called Washington and passed on my
                    recollections. I promised to provide some specific citations.</p>
                <p>That night I awoke with a startle and I called out “Akhromeyev and Shevardnadze!”
                    I woke Chris up in the process. I said, “I think I kept some of their statements
                    about LANCE modernization and the SS-23 and German Pershings.” The next morning,
                    I did indeed find the articles noted above as well as the dates of the
                    conversations with Obukhov. The articles which I read from were of particular
                    value obviously, because they were on the public record. No one reading them,
                    then or now, can come to any conclusion other than that the Soviet foreign
                    minister, the leading Soviet military officer, and a former Soviet chief INF
                    negotiator and well plugged-in ambassador were either unaware of the transfer of
                    the SS-23s to GDR, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia, or were knowingly falsifying,
                    or to put it bluntly lying, by claiming that their Warsaw Pact allies would be
                    at a disadvantage if the Germans kept their PIA missiles or modernized its LANCE
                    missiles because the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies had no comparable
                    missile. The Soviets also argued that the SS-23 missiles provided to the three
                    Warsaw Pact states were not subject to the INF treaty because they were
                    non-nuclear. But as they well knew, the treaty applies to all INF missiles,
                    whether conventional or nuclear armed. Moreover, with the East German SS-23
                    available for inspection, it became clear that these missiles were configured to
                    accept nuclear warheads. Yet, the Soviets continued to argue that the
                    transferred SS-23s were conventional weapons and thus not subject to the
                    treaty.</p>
                <p>I did have some further discussions, well afterwards, with some Soviets about how
                    this could happen. Some speculated that there was bad blood between Akhromeyev
                    and some of the Soviet field commanders, but clearly orders from Gorbachev were
                    not followed out. I think that Shevardnadze basically said, “I believe that
                    comrade Gorbachev was not aware of this, and I can assure you personally that I
                    was not aware of it.” Again, it reflects the situation inside the Kremlin; that
                    this sort of thing would happen and the leadership would be unaware of it, and
                    placed in the position of making the sort of statements that they did make. I
                    think there was more; I could go on and on about this issue, but we have taken
                    long enough. I clearly was quite angry about it, and I suggested to Washington
                    that we ought to refer to this as deliberate deception, but I guessed people
                    back there had a better feel of the overall situation and opted for “bad faith,”
                    as a way to describe it. It was an interesting affair I think. There was no
                    doubt that Gorbachev's decision to include the SS-23 had ramifications. Clearly
                    things happened as a result of that decision which undermined him and were a
                    sign of the growing weakness of his power within the Soviet Union.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask this question. Our intelligence did not know
                        that these had been placed in the GDR, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: No. And in my view, regardless of how you look at the rest of it, this
                    was a failure of intelligence. We did not know. From what I understand now, I
                    think this was all in the press, we knew once our German allies had the
                    missiles. The Soviets were able to place these missiles with other missiles that
                    were not covered by the agreement and were very careful about when they would
                    take them out and so on. All that being said, it was a failure of
                    intelligence—and worrisome in that regard. We had as good an inspection regime
                    as we could have. But they had found places to put these missiles. Whether they
                    were in a position to use them as a force, as opposed to having them there but
                    not being coordinated, I don't have the answer to that. But, yes, it was a
                    failure of the intelligence; we have to face up to that and bear that in mind as
                    we go forward in comparable assessments.</p>
                <p>I guess the other thing we have to recognize is that as time went by, very soon
                    after the fall of Berlin Wall and all that followed from that, and the end of
                    the Soviet Union, that Margaret Thatcher's effort to set up a “firebreak,”
                    against total denuclearization of NATO, that began to crumble within 24 months.
                    We did not go ahead with the follow-on to LANCE; we did not go ahead with TASM;
                    and what remains now are essentially gravity bombs on aircraft. It is the same
                    situation. We own the bombs and some of the aircraft, and the allies provide the
                    rest of the aircraft. The strategic link back to the U.S. strategic system is
                    thus still there.</p>
                <p>But at this juncture at least, NATO is now looking at this whole question of
                    what's left and what to do with these residual systems. I think there are
                    committees set up to examine it. The Russians are being brought into the
                    discussion on how to handle that. It would be interesting to see how it plays
                    out. To some extent, the Allies may still welcome having these systems around,
                    as providing a visual proof of a linkage to our nuclear strategic forces and
                    that they, in turn, are prepared to share with us the responsibility of nuclear
                    weapons. I don't know how it will all turn out.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>The whole issue was an interesting one. Beyond that, I think there is probably a
                    lot more for researchers and historians to uncover just what happened inside the
                    Soviet government at this juncture because, as we've seen, there were some
                    problems there. Gorbachev comments about what his delegation was doing in Geneva
                    at this point. He sort of complained about the Soviet military and diplomats not
                    really working. And that began after Reykjavik. There was that sense that there
                    was a coming apart there. He notes that he was having trouble getting our
                    counterparts to move. That's in his memoirs. At one point he makes a comment
                    along the lines of “These guys were finding life too cushy in Geneva and they
                    didn't want to leave. They were enjoying being paid in hard currency,” etc. They
                    were just dragging their feet. Obviously, he sounds very bitter. Again, this is
                    in his memoirs. He had gone through a difficult time himself. As I say, I think
                    historians should have an interesting time going further into this to determine
                    exactly what happened.</p>
                <p>Let's go back a little bit now and take a look at how the negotiation itself
                    ended. We've already seen some of the consequences later years.</p>
                <p>The last group of issues we had to work on were verification questions. We had
                    for years been trying to get the Soviets to move ahead seriously. Eventually,
                    and slowly they came along. What they began to do after a while, however, was to
                    take positions which were seemingly more open than ours. And I don't believe
                    that they were really prepared to carry some out of these positions, but it was
                    a way of trying to score propaganda points—to suggest that they would be more
                    open than we were. We got caught up in this in a way. Verification is a
                    difficult enough subject, extremely technical. We've already discussed the
                    consequences of the SS-23s and the verification regime not working as it should.
                    What I found as we got into this topic was that, the people working on it and
                    including myself when I got into it, got caught up in what I refer to as
                    “nightmare, dream, nightmare, dream, nightmare, dream” syndrome. What do I mean
                    by that? You start looking at an issue. How do we verify that these missiles are
                    actually being destroyed? Then you begin to have nightmares. “My God, what we
                    are proposing isn't good enough.” So you try to think about how to improve it.
                    And that's the dream. The dream comes along, and now you dream “how you are
                    going to verify it?” And the next day it's another nightmare. As a result of
                    this “nightmare, dream, nightmare, dream” syndrome, we couldn't get anywhere.
                    Because it never ended. Every time you thought you were closing a loophole, our
                    team, we ourselves, would find ways around that, closing one loophole, and then
                    opening another one. The result is no action is taken. You are paralyzed because
                    you cannot come to closure on the issue. You cannot recognize that “this is as
                    good as we can get.” The issue got to the point where we were beginning to look
                    at the prospect of going to inspect anywhere at any time.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>Colonel Bob Linhard, who was the NSC point man on the INF treaty, a wonderful man
                    and a very easy guy to work with, dubbed this the “Fruit-Loops problem” as in
                    Fruit Loops cereal. Because, as he pointed out, we had reached the point in our
                    proposal in which the Soviets could demand access to a Kellogg's Fruit Loops
                    factory in case something was being built there, and we would have to grant it
                    to them—and of course that was nonsense. We reached the point where the more
                    stringent we made the verification and inspections on the Soviets, the more
                    stringent they would be on us. So beyond Fruit Loops, we can get serious and
                    talk about plants that we would let them into, in order to get into their
                    plants. The Soviets saw that we were getting caught up in this and they tried to
                    up the ante, so that they would show that they were more interested in
                    verification than we were. In the end, we were able to say to them, “We know you
                    are not serious, let's both get serious about this and stop playing games.” It
                    was very difficult for those in Washington who were working on this problem, to
                    come to closure with the issue, because of that “dream, nightmare” syndrome.</p>
                <p>But eventually we did so. The program that we have is the most stringent
                    verification program ever. Again, obviously it is not perfect. It did involve
                    site inspection; it involved continuous monitoring of the Soviet factory in
                    Votkinsk, where the SS-20s were being made and where some missiles are still
                    being made, although there are no more SS-20s coming out. We still have people
                    there. This regime will all come to an end this year. The treaty permitted 13
                    years of inspection. That was based on the experts' view that was about the time
                    it would take for the missiles to become obsolescent and, therefore, their value
                    would be reduced even if they were producing them. We had gotten rights to come
                    on site to all their INF bases. There was an exchange of data, photographs, and
                    diagrams and charts. By and large the verification system worked quite well in
                    terms of the way they were seeing problems and working them out. I attended the
                    destruction of the last Pershing missile. General Medvedev was also there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: That was in Texas, in Marshall, Texas, we had a factory there, and that
                    was where they were being destroyed. They just destroyed it by running the
                    engine. It sort of died down, if you will, the flames coming out the back, and
                    the rocket engine is gone. Then machines came and crushed the airframe. That's
                    how those were destroyed. Others were destroyed in different ways. We had at the
                    end of the negotiation a number of highly trained technical people, because we
                    had to discuss such technical things as, “If we are going to allow the Soviets
                    to keep this particular piece of equipment, how can we cut it apart so that the
                    launcher can no longer raise the missile?” And we had technical experts who were
                    engineers and were obviously familiar with the Soviet systems. They would guide
                    the negotiators; they would point out, in effect, “this is what you can accept
                    and this is what you can't accept.”</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>The treaty sets up a body to discuss questions and problems. The Special
                    Consultative Group is a type of committee; it continues to meet regularly. They
                    had a lot of work to do. We got down into details about what you could and
                    couldn't bring in on an inspection. We put things in there, in verification,
                    which didn't exist. For example, we wanted to look inside the Soviet canisters,
                    since missiles come out in canisters from the factory. How can we be sure what
                    is in there? And how do we assure that they were bringing out an SS-25, which is
                    very similar to SS-20, and not an SS-20. There are ways that we could measure.
                    We got them to agree that we could pop open a canister, I think it was three of
                    four times a year, and look inside the canister to determine that this had to be
                    an SS-25 and not an SS-20. In addition to that, whatever the number of times
                    was, the people who did sampling theory said that we had a very good sample
                    number. It was enough to be fairly confident that we would be able to catch one
                    if it was ever to come out.</p>
                <p>In addition, the question was raised about the canisters that can't be opened? I,
                    half-jokingly, half-seriously had said, “What about an x-ray machine?” One of
                    the scientists said, “Anything big enough to see through that skin would have to
                    cook everything between Votkinsk and the Urals.” And I said “Better yet!” It
                    turned out that we put that provision into the treaty—about the machine—but it
                    didn't exist. And the scientists and the engineers did create such a machine.
                    Another thing that was foreseen was related to the SS-20 having three warheads,
                    while its near relative, the SS-25 had only one. So in addition to various
                    things that we could do and look at, we felt we needed some permission,
                    agreement in the treaty, to take radioactive detectors of some sort with us into
                    those bases and to pass the detector over the warhead, over the nosecone, and
                    say, “This has got a single one and this has got one, and oops! this one here
                    has three.” It shouldn't have three. We got that in there. Again, this is part
                    of where that “dream, nightmare” syndrome can lead you to. It is not all bad—the
                    syndrome—if it comes up with some provisions that we would be able to put into
                    the treaty. But Fruit Loops, just to get back to them, that marked the extreme,
                    and I think after that we began to calm down.</p>
                <p>A couple of other things that we need to talk about. We did find out, as we got
                    near the end, that there were systems which we had not heard of previously. We
                    had them and the Soviets had similar systems. These are systems which launch
                    satellites and things like that, but they could look a lot like eliminated
                    system. So we had to find ways to incorporate that subject. This was really a
                    lack of communication within the U.S. government, and it was the same on their
                    side. The people who were running these systems seemed to be unaware that we
                    were dealing with missiles that had their range, and we were certainly unaware
                    of their systems. Their stuff is probably fairly highly classified, and I am
                    sure they didn't want everyone to know that they have test vehicles of these
                    sorts. But, the Soviets had the same and we exchanged diagrams of what they look
                    like and so on, and they finally did get included.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>A few interesting things happened at the end. These concern the final ending of
                    the negotiation, when we were heading towards the 8th of December when the
                    treaty was to be signed. As late as Thanksgiving, Secretary Shultz and some of
                    his people had to come to Geneva to deal with detail questions. I really felt
                    badly about his having to come, but in fact what was left suddenly became the
                    most important thing on Earth. Three weeks earlier, three months earlier, it
                    wouldn't have been given the same prominence, but now was what was left. So we
                    had all kinds of problems. Let me give you one quick example. And it's
                    instructive in other ways.</p>
                <p>We wanted to be able to drive away, the cabs, the front ends of a semi-trailer,
                    as all of our systems were set up as a semi-trailer arrangement with the back of
                    the semi-trailer being where the missiles were carried. And you could drive away
                    the front part. So our view for how to destroy the front part was to just drive
                    it away. There was no sense in tearing it up; it was the same kind of tractor
                    that we use for tank transporters. The Soviets did not use semi-trailers. They
                    all had one long body. So when we said that we wanted to drive away the front,
                    they said, “That is good for you but we can't; so you've got to figure out some
                    way to let us keep the whole thing together.” That's where the experts had to
                    come in. But we got hung up here. One of the issues in which Secretary Shultz
                    and Akhromeyev and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze got into this discussion was on
                    how they were going to do it. It turned out that in some instances, we found
                    that for us it was cheaper to destroy some of the back-ends, the trailers,
                    rather than try to convert them to put tanks on them. It was cheaper to buy the
                    new ones than to convert the old ones. And Akhromeyev said, “You must be a very
                    rich country to be able to blow these things away.” And of course, the point was
                    that we are a very wealthy country, but it also demonstrated that we can come up
                    with another system, one which made it possible to drive away the front and keep
                    the back, or not keep the back. These were some of the things that the senior
                    officials were forced to address. As it was, near the end we began to look at
                    what was left in brackets. We'd go through the treaty and we'd put the brackets
                    around the words or phrases that were not agreed upon. That's how we proceeded.
                    There were a fair number of brackets. I remember cabling back that we had 120
                    brackets. Many of them were interrelated. If you solved problem A, you'd solve
                    B, C, D, E, F and G. So you might get rid of 10 brackets by solving one problem.
                    But the people in Washington were quite concerned when we sent that cable. I
                    just asked them to calm down, but wanted them to know that we had it all
                    tracked. We knew that if we got “A” solved, here is what our B, C, D, and E are,
                    and we will remove the brackets from them.</p>

                <p>Near the very end, we had a terrible confrontation with the Soviets. It involved
                    who gets to look inside what. The treaty is set up so that each side can look at
                    the other side's smallest object. And the Soviets wanted to see inside a
                    container which could include the smallest part. And of course they wanted to
                    get into the smallest stage of a Pershing missile. And we wanted, therefore, to
                    see inside a canister which could hold the smallest stage of the SS-20. And they
                    said, “No, you can't do that; that is not correct, etc., etc.” They just
                    wouldn't give on it. At this point, I had been going day and night, and the
                    Soviets had begun double-teaming me as we were getting into this issue. One time
                    I'd have Medvedev opposite me, then I'd have Obukhov, and I was there alone.
                    Finally after we caught on to what was going on, we'd look out the window if
                    they came to our place, and if Medvedev got out of the car, I'd go back to the
                    office and work on other issues. John Woodworth would take over that meeting.
                    But I got very tired. Not quite ill, but what really happened was that I began
                    to get angry. Obukhov, on one occasion, went on and on without translation, and
                    I said to him, “How about stopping and letting us have a translation?” And he
                    just wouldn't listen. He just kept going on and on in Russian. I got up and left
                    the table. I went back and got a glass of orange juice. He suddenly went into
                    English, I brought the orange juice back, and he stayed in English. But I could
                    feel myself really getting at the point where I was going to loose my temper. He
                    had a tendency to go on at great length. He was covering every flank. He
                    couldn't just discuss this “chair.” He was afraid that you might conclude that
                    by not discussing the location of the chair in the room, you were leaving open
                    the fact that maybe the chair could be somewhere else. You see what I am getting
                    at? It's probably a technique that you need to survive in a society like that of
                    the USSR; it could back you up in a corner if you didn't. Make sure that every
                    flank in your argument was covered. But, this went on and on.</p>
                <p>On one occasion, this again in the last couple of days of going through this
                    approach, I said to him, “Look, can't you stop this dance of the seven veils and
                    get to your position?” He turned to the Soviet interpreter and said, “What is
                    this 'dance of the seven veils'?” The interpreter said, “It's an Oriental
                    dance.” I looked at Woodworth and said, “Now we are going to hear an explosion.”
                    And he did explode. “What do you mean, Oriental?” And I said, “Look, it's a
                    dance, that's all, veils are removed,” anyway, he was quite unhappy about that
                    word.</p>
                <p>Another episode—all or this action coming near the end. We had a couple of days,
                    Saturday, Sunday, or whatever it was, and we were supposed to go to the Soviet
                    mission. But then they would call us and say, “No don't come now we are not
                    ready yet. Don't come now, but in another two or three hours.” It went on like
                    that for the whole day and on into the next day. It was obvious they didn't have
                    their instructions, they were missing their guidance. But they didn't tell us
                    that, they just kept putting us off. Finally, we went over there, and I forget
                    what the issues were. Could have been some of this stuff we were just
                    mentioning, verification stuff, which was mostly all that was left. Finally we
                    go over there, as we were leaving the place, Obukhov said to me, “I am really
                    sorry about yesterday and earlier today.”</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>Let me back up here. What happened in fact, was I just said “Let's go over there,
                    ready or not.” So we did. And there they were. As we left, he said, “I am sorry
                    that we had to carry on the way we did today, but in fact we simply didn't have
                    our guidance.” I said, “I assumed you didn't have your guidance, why didn't you
                    just tell us that and tell us that you would let us know when you are ready?”
                    But then he let drop that they had gone up to the Jura to ski on that day. He
                    couldn't have chosen a subject that was more likely to make me really furious.
                    That they had kept us in the office waiting for them, while they had gone off
                    and skied. So I grew angrier. This began to take a toll on me physically. My
                    blood pressure is normally low, but it must have been going through the roof at
                    this point.</p>
                <p>Anyway years later when I began to think about it, I said to myself, “Wait a
                    minute. They may not have gone skiing at all.” He may have just known or been
                    told that one way to get my goat was to do something like that. I don't know
                    what the truth to that is, but in any case, I felt that I was getting angrier
                    and began to question my judgment frankly. In addition to that, I got a phone
                    call, four a.m., our time, from Jim Timbie, who was one of the people in the
                    State Department who was sort of behind the scenes, deeply involved in all arms
                    control issues, very able fellow, physicist by background. He called me and
                    said, “What are you guys doing there? You are changing some of the time
                    arrangements; you are making it possible for the inspections regime to end
                    before 13 years.” And so on. Normally, he is a very calm person, but he wasn't
                    calm on this occasion. He said, “The Secretary has told everyone that it was
                    going to go 13 years and now you've made it possible that it might not be 13
                    years,” and I could feel myself getting upset. I explained to him that what we
                    did essentially was to set it up in such a way that we couldn't, we wouldn't
                    find ourselves in the position where the Soviets would have us no longer
                    inspecting their place, while they could still inspect at ours. This was
                    designed to protect us from getting into that kind of spot. He said, “Okay” at
                    the end of it. That night I had gone home, Leo Reddy drove me back, I remember,
                    it was cold, and I was really feeling badly, didn't really sleep well that day,
                    came back the next day, and at that point I realized that if they continued with
                    their tactics I was ready to jump across the table and slug them. It was really
                    getting to me. Therefore, I took myself out. I said, “John take over. I will be
                    back tomorrow, I've got to leave or I am going to do something stupid if I stay
                    here. It might be gratifying to do it, but it would be stupid.” John Woodworth
                    took over and he worked again, late night. Next day I did come back. I had
                    calmed down enough.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>John Woodward was furious at the Soviets. He thought that he made a deal with
                    them in which we could look into a container which could hold the smallest stage
                    of a SS-20 and they could look at a container which could hold the smallest
                    stage of a P-II. Obukhov suddenly said, “No, that's not at all possible.” That's
                    when I came back in; he was backing away from it. So I went through it again
                    with Obukhov, I said, “Look, we can't have the situation where you get to open a
                    box which can hold the smallest stage of our missile, but we don't get to look
                    into a box which can hold your equivalent. That is just not going to
                    wash—especially with the SS-20 involved.” I knew that we could look at the box
                    size of their smallest missile, which was their cruise missile, a box that could
                    hold that. But I did not think Congress would appreciate coming back and saying,
                    “They get to look at the smallest stage of the Pershing and we can't look at a
                    box that will hold the smallest stage of SS-20.” They tried to argue “Well, we
                    don't have stages.” I said, “Oh, yeah? Look here in the Memorandum of
                    Understanding, the MOU,” which had all the data exchange in there. “It shows you
                    have stages; here is what size it is, and it says so right here.” “Well, we
                    don't take them apart.” “It doesn't matter whether you take them apart or not,”
                    I said. “You just list that.” He was being very obstinate.</p>
                <p>At that point, it was getting late. We were scheduled to leave the next day for
                    Washington. We had an Air Force plane. They were going to have to fly
                    commercial. We had time, an Air Force plane would wait for us, but a commercial
                    flight would not wait for them. We were doing the U.S. copy of the treaty,
                    typing it in Geneva. Helen Moses from ACDA did the typing and did a wonderful
                    job. We were ready to go, we had a way to get back, but they didn't. I said at
                    that point, “Look, we are all tired. Why don't we take a break, come back at
                    four a.m. or five a.m. and conclude with that?” And I walked out. Picked up my
                    books and walked out. And the delegation followed me. He came running
                    afterwards. “What's wrong? What's wrong?” I said, “I told you what's wrong. If
                    you get to look at the box that could hold the smallest stages of our missile,
                    we are going to be able to look inside a box which would be small enough to hold
                    the smallest stage of the SS-20.” I felt it just wouldn't be fair. He thought
                    about it for a moment and said, “Look, if that's all there is to it, we can work
                    it out. You want to be able to say that you can open a box that would hold no
                    more than the smallest stage of our missile.” “That's right,” I said, “We want
                    to be able look in something that small.” Both sides were trying to get into the
                    smaller box, not to be looking into a bigger box. He agreed to that. We went
                    back to the room together and the delegation reassembled, we put that together
                    very quickly, and it was over.</p>
                <p>That still left a couple of problems. One was that we had to initial the treaty.
                    I received authorization earlier from Washington to initial for the U.S., and we
                    had one outstanding issue. That was which Russian word we would use to interpret
                    the English word “undertakings.” That was the very last thing we resolved.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>Let me set out a little background on that. It is very interesting in light of
                    the recent question how do you say “I apologize” in Chinese. At one point—and
                    I'll try to stay away from names in this discussion—near the end of the
                    negotiating sessions (it would have been in November), we had a visit from
                    someone from Washington and a similar visit from someone from Moscow. Both
                    wanted to help us reach a conclusion of the treaty. The visitors sat down and
                    began going over various parts of the treaty, which we had been working on. The
                    Soviet visitor focused on a section of the treaty—sort of normal “boiler
                    plate”—it has to do with what we call non- circumvention arrangements. If I had
                    my copy of the treaty here I could find it. Since I don't have my copy of the
                    treaty, I will have to wing it a bit. Basically, we were dealing with the part
                    of the treaty that we had picked up from the old SALT agreement. It was boiler
                    plate; it was not controversial. The purpose of this section was, in effect, to
                    say, that you think it is common sense that if you sign a treaty—and you intend
                    to carry it out—that you won't do anything to contravene it, to “circumvent” it.
                    Those were the kind of concepts being reviewed.</p>
                <p>The Soviet visitor wanted to change that. He wanted to make it a little more
                    open, looser. What was the issue here? The issue gets back to those programs of
                    cooperation. We wanted that part of the treaty to read in a way which would make
                    it possible for us to continue our programs of cooperation. We did not want to
                    place ourselves in a situation where the Soviets could argue that if an American
                    and a Brit sat down and began to discuss the possibility of setting up some new
                    program, under the pattern of cooperation, maybe a new missile or a new part for
                    an old missile, the Soviets could wind up saying this is contrary to the INF
                    agreement. In addition to that possibility, as I said, that language had been
                    approved in earlier treaties. Congress was used to it; Congress had seen the
                    language previously. The Soviet began to probe. Maybe we could add something
                    else that could meet these concerns of ours. The American visitor said, “Well,
                    what about adding the word 'undertakings' to this?” That we would not engage in
                    any activities or undertakings which would not be consistent with the treaty.
                    Something like that. I said to the visitor, quietly, “That's an awful word. We
                    can't use that.” And the visitor said, “I know what I am doing.” So it stayed in
                    there. I went back to the office, I saw our lawyer, again, Karen Lawson at the
                    time, now Karen Look. I told her about this and she said, “Oh my Gosh.” I said,
                    “Look, we are going to have to find a way around this.” She said, “Go back in
                    the afternoon and try to get Obukhov to back off of this.” I said, “I'll try.” I
                    did but I didn't have much hope for that.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>The next thing I did, however, before I went back down to the afternoon meeting,
                    was to get a hold of a thesaurus, and look up the word “undertakings.” As I
                    suspected, it had five different meanings. And it's not all bad. It went from a
                    discussion or undertaking as something you arrive at over a cup of coffee, to
                    something very formal, like an act. Like the Helsinki Final Act. I called in our
                    interpreter, our head translator, Dimitri Erensburger. I said, “Dimitri, see
                    this word? Here is the thesaurus. See this English version of it? Please find a
                    Russian word that equates to this very formal activity. I don't want it to be
                    loose; it has got to be a very formal activity, something like the Formal Act of
                    Helsinki.” He said, “I will try.” He came back and he said, “I found a Russian
                    word that equates to something like an undertaking, something like the Final Act
                    of Helsinki.” I said, “Good.” He said, “It's an archaic word.” I said, “It's in
                    the dictionary?” “Yes, it's in the great Bolshoi Dictionary.” I said, “Fine.
                    When the time comes to translate from English into Russian, we must have that
                    word in Russian.” I said, “Don't give in on that point.” And he didn't. And at
                    the end, the very last thing Obukhov said to me, of substance, was “You have
                    your Russian word.” This issue came up frequently enough during the hearings, I
                    was asked about it. “Why did you get something new here? What is this new word?”
                    I was just able to say, “Yes it's a new word, it was placed there, but here is
                    how I dealt with it. I found a Russian word that equates to a formal act, and
                    therefore it cannot apply just to some general conversation.” And subsequently,
                    one of the Senators came up to me and said (because we had to turn over all of
                    our transcripts to them, that's another story linked to SDI actually), in any
                    case, he looked it up and he said, “I understand what you did. I see what
                    happened. And why you did what you did.” So that's how we did it; that was the
                    last thing we settled.</p>
                <p>The next morning we arranged to take the Soviets, Obukhov, General Medvedev, and
                    one of their secretaries, along with their computer on the Air Force plane with
                    us. Bringing them with us was cleared with Washington; we could do that. As we
                    left Geneva, at least officially for the last time, the whole delegation piled
                    in the buses, and we left for the airport. Before leaving, I went up to the
                    office that I occupied and the floor that we were on. It was filled with plastic
                    bags of left-over pizzas and so on. I got to the point where I had eaten so many
                    pizzas during that period that I couldn't eat pizza for months afterwards. And
                    all of us, as I mentioned I gotten to a point where I wasn't feeling well, every
                    one of us had sleep deprivation. I called a doctor over at one point, and he
                    said, “It's nothing, you are just exhausted.” That's when I pulled myself out of
                    it for a bit. He said, “You are just exhausted.” But I noticed I wasn't eating.
                    The guys all said afterwards, the reason there were all these empty pizzas and
                    stuff, most of the folks figured that those of us who were over 40 or 50 (the
                    younger ones were fine) just stopped eating. We were working 24-hours a day, day
                    after day, and it was a strange phenomena. We couldn't look at food. It quickly
                    ended— that phenomenon of not eating. But, in any case, there were all of these
                    mounds of stuff that we threw out. The shredding machine was working over time.
                    It was a bit like a disaster zone that we had left behind us.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>We had the treaty paper sent over to us. It was beautiful, fine, “meant to last,”
                    paper. The Department of State, I guess, hadn't really prepared for this
                    negotiation, so they didn't have a lot of paper available, but they sent us all
                    they had. Helen Moses couldn't make a mistake. Thank goodness Helen Moses didn't
                    make any mistakes—or only a very few. A few things that turned up may not have
                    been her doing; it may have been the people who plugged in some geographic
                    coordinates for location 73W 21S or something like that, and it was 22S,
                    whatever. A few of those things, we corrected when we got back to Washington.
                    But we made it through with the paper on hand. We did start initialing the
                    treaties that night instead of going to bed and getting up at 4 a.m., we went
                    ahead and initialed the treaty. I don't have any photos; some of the guys were
                    taking photos; people were taking pictures at the time, but I never got a
                    picture of that.</p>
                <p>Jeff Ankley went ahead and bought a bunch of pens, INF treaty pens, which he
                    handed out. I was using them. I would sign with the pen and then hand it back to
                    the folks. Good move on his part. Ankley had been in Vietnam. He was our
                    executive officer; he did a fine job at keeping morale up during this period. He
                    said this was closest, in terms of stress, the closest he'd ever seen to combat.
                    He's a big fellow, but could fall asleep in the strangest places. He was
                    surviving on Cokes and cigarettes and his own energy.</p>
                <p>We had that “ceremony” and then on the airplane as we flew back, we initialed
                    some of the annexes. We began one of them over Chartres, and the pilot sent back
                    to say “here is where you are as you initial this.” As I mentioned, we flew back
                    with the Soviets and, after a bit, everybody went to sleep—including the
                    Soviets. They were hoping to arrive in Washington before Gorbachev, but we
                    didn't. We just missed and his plane landed just before ours at Andrews. I guess
                    the Soviets wanted to be there to meet him when he arrived. At the end of the
                    flight, we got near Andrews, and as I mentioned the Soviets brought along a
                    secretary. It was the first time any of us had laid any eyes on the Soviet
                    staff. We always would invite everybody to U.S. functions, but they only invited
                    the officers, not the staff. Anyway, this was a nice young lady. They also
                    brought with them their computer. It was in a box, tied up with the most
                    magnificent knots. Everyone commented on what a beautiful way they tied it
                    together with these knots. We had already moved to “floppy disks,” but they had
                    not gotten to that stage. They basically had to bring their computer; it was the
                    hard drive and a good size box. Anyway, as we approached Andrews, a little
                    before landing, the Soviets were awake and suddenly a pillow fight broke out
                    among the Americans. And the Soviets were wondering, “What the heck are these
                    guys and gals up to?” But anyway, the plane landed. That leaves us with a very
                    long ratification process, and then we are finished with this part of the
                    narrative.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>The treaty was set to come up for hearings very soon after we arrived there,
                    following Christmas. But it wasn't until May, I forget the exact date, when the
                    treaty was finally accepted by the Senate. I spent full time on that. Chris and
                    Herkie the dog came over. They flew at our own expense, and we found sort of a
                    temporary one-bedroom apartment to stay in with the dog. We just settled down to
                    live there until the treaty got done. We just left everything behind in Geneva,
                    and that's all that we could do at that point; there was no time to go back to
                    Geneva to mess with it. We both got a chance to go to Washington, and I got a
                    chance to see to some extent how the Congress works. We were very well received
                    and treated. There were lots of events that we attended. The President had me
                    over for the signing of the treaty and other things like that. I felt good about
                    it. I was given an office on the Hill. Dave Jones and others came and helped,
                    such as Ron Bartek, another guy who was active in the agreement, in the treaty.
                    I should back up and make a point about Ron and some of the others.</p>
                <p>Each one of these annexes required someone to work on it. And people like Ron
                    Bartek and others, I should have all their names, I will try to eventually get
                    them all into the transcript and not leave them out. I assigned each one of
                    them. Someone else looked at this part of the acts, on verification, the annex
                    on elimination. Leo Reddy already had a really tough job. He had to get the
                    treaties that we wrote with all of the five basing countries. What we did with
                    the treaty, in effect, was allowing the Soviets to come onto let's say Germany,
                    or the Netherlands, or Belgium or Italy, or the U.K.; to come into our base; and
                    inspect to see what is in our base. However, it was on their sovereign
                    territory, and the Soviets had to come through their customs and all. So Leo had
                    to work on these arrangements between each of the countries and with the Soviets
                    who were going in there. And that took quite a task. Obviously, we had full
                    cooperation from Allies, and we worked it out completely, but it was a
                    painstaking effort. He did an excellent job on that. I don't think there was
                    ever any negative repercussion from that project. So we had that done. And the
                    same thing with the annexes, as I said. Individuals were put in charge of them.
                    John Woodworth and I didn't go to all of those, we just couldn't we were working
                    with Obukhov on the treaty itself. As events occurred, one or the other of us
                    would find out about it; if we had to make a decision, we would. And we were
                    always in constant contact. John was really a good friend, and he and his family
                    became really close to us. We had lot of good times together. He was a good,
                    calm fellow in a tough situation. And quite smart, able to deal with the
                    Soviets. Between us we managed to keep abreast of what was going on. At that
                    point five or six were in the circle, as we were coming to a conclusion.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>The hearings usually begin with the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense and
                    other principle speakers on the U.S. side, and then the negotiators go next. We
                    had to meet with both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate
                    Armed Services Committee. I felt pretty much in command of the subject, frankly.
                    So I was reasonably comfortable going through this. There were a couple of times
                    when it got a little difficult early on, but most of the questions, we had
                    anticipated. The most difficult period, one which continues to have
                    ramifications today, involved the Armed Services Committee. We had some
                    questions from Senator Nunn over the legal language. I remember there was a
                    clause in the treaty—it is still there—that begins with “Not withstanding,” and
                    he said that his professor at law school told him never to use that phrase, and
                    he didn't want to see it there. It was a complex grammatical sentence, trying to
                    deal with issues that were not easy to state simply. I think he eventually
                    agreed with it. Some of the other senators—I remember Senator Levin—seemed to
                    agree with us, that it made sense, but to Senator Nunn it did not. I know
                    eventually, he signed it, he agreed to the treaty, and I am sure it satisfied
                    him in the end. The toughest group of questions was from Senator Quayle. Here
                    again, I mention to you things like these test missiles that sort of popped up
                    late in the day; we were not even aware of them. During the hearings, Senator
                    Quayle began to talk about systems that could be considered INF systems, and he
                    made reference to some of them, and they sounded like what are called “black
                    systems,” that is, systems that are not covered under the normal course of
                    business. They are not in the budget; they are like the U2. It was a black
                    system before it came out and the people learned about it. I had no idea what
                    Quayle was talking about. He began to describe some of these things, and he kept
                    pushing me to respond to “is this covered or isn't it.” I kept trying to tell
                    him, I finally said, “I feel very uncomfortable answering the question. Talking
                    about systems that you know about and I don't. And you are asking me to say
                    whether or not they'd be covered and I frankly can not be considered
                    authoritative on this subject.” That word “authoritative” came up frequently in
                    the context of the ABM treaty, who was authoritative and who wasn't, and then
                    they said in INF that they were going to make us all say that we were
                    authoritative, which I was prepared to do, but not on this one—because I had no
                    idea what he was talking about. But I do now. Years later I finally found out
                    what it was all about. It was a difficult moment.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>At one point, I kind of saw what he was getting at. He seemed to want to leave
                    open a loop-hole for us, basically. We had a break at one point, and I remember
                    saying to him, “Look, I think I know what you are after, but please don't keep
                    pushing me for a more and more precise response, because it's going to make it
                    harder to achieve what you would like to achieve.” Which was as I said, try to
                    leave it more open. But he kept going after it, and eventually got into a long
                    argument about what is a weapon. Of course, the other senators joined in. I
                    finally said to Senator Quayle, “There is a simple definition.” He then asked,
                    “Why didn't you define a weapon?” I said, “Look, we can't define it. It's a
                    commonly understood word, international law permits that, commonly understood
                    words. If you start getting into that, you'll end up having to attach what is
                    Roget's Unabridged Thesaurus and the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, as annex to the
                    treaty so you can define every word.” He kept pushing, and I told him, as I
                    said, “If you keep pushing you are going to get an answer you don't want. I
                    think I know what you want, and I am somewhat sympathetic to trying to keep it
                    open for a new system, but don't push me.” He did and consequently I gave a
                    simple definition of a weapon as something that damages or destroys. We talked
                    about, well is it a weapon if it does this and it does that, finally I said, “I
                    can't be authoritative on this.”</p>
                <p>It was a tough time. Of course the transcript is available and I have it. Books
                    have come out, but even when I read it today, I get upset. I realize that it
                    wasn't helpful to this cause as I saw it. I think most of the senators—I could
                    tell from their comments—they understood what I was up against. But, everyone
                    has the right to ask questions; they ought to ask questions, senatorial courtesy
                    is there as it should be. I did my best to give him the answers, and the
                    Department of State Washington lawyers backed me up. They came back with a
                    definition which pretty much tracked what I just gave you now. That would be it.
                    It was in some ways quite frustrating, not knowing what he was talking about. It
                    was one of those things that could have been done better.</p>
                <p>We negotiators didn't know about what these guys were doing, this black system,
                    because we didn't have access to it, but they should have known what we were
                    doing. And they should have been aware that we could be impinging on the
                    systems. But that connection was not made. It's okay. As far as I can tell, it
                    worked out all right. We passed it, but it was a difficult moment.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>The treaty was ratified and there were only five who voted against. I think I can
                    still name them, but I won't. We had a very good outcome in terms of support for
                    which we were appreciative. To wrap it up, I would give Gorbachev the last word.
                    In his memoirs, he says it was the INF treaty that made it all possible
                    afterwards. That's what ended the Cold War. It was the last battle, and we ended
                    it. If we had not succeeded, God knows what we would be facing today. It might
                    not be NATO any longer; it might have turned out very badly. But we did it. It
                    took both diplomacy and the potential of force. You couldn't do without it. And
                    that's again where the peace movement, I felt, had missed the point. The Soviets
                    were not going to give us something for nothing. We had to prove, to demonstrate
                    on the ground that we could get the missiles in, and that NATO was going to do
                    this. That made the difference. All of the logic in the world won't help you if
                    you can't, in fact, carry this thing out. As I said, the question about the
                    continuation of basing some of these systems in Europe is another issue. There
                    were some problems with SS-23s as we discussed earlier. In the end none of that
                    really mattered. We wouldn't be where we are now if it hadn't been for the
                    treaty coming out—the whole activity—not just the treaty coming out where it
                    did.</p>
                <p>The next little bit is what happens when we go back to Brussels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, on July 15, 1988, you were appointed Ambassador to
                        the Kingdom of Belgium. You presented your credentials on September 28,
                        1988. How was it that you received this appointment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: The process of appointment is, in some way, a mystery to those who are
                    not directly involved. I think in each case, there is some factor that you
                    cannot account for. In this case, I was finished with the INF treaty and the
                    exchange of ratification had taken place; documents of ratification had been
                    exchanged. That job was done. Just as an example, getting back to the factor of
                    luck, when I was in front of the congressional committees, it would have been a
                    very inopportune moment to be appointed to anywhere, because then there would be
                    combination of the treaty and my appointment. The two would be seen as a single
                    unit by some senators. And you really don't want to mix the two. The treaty was
                    far more important to have any side elements brought into it. So, there was no
                    possibility of appointment during that time. But, that was over in May,
                    certainly by June.</p>
                <p>Geoffrey Swaebe, who was the Ambassador in Brussels, asked to be relieved. I was
                    open and the post was open. I believe that's how it happened. I also, of course,
                    knew Belgium; we had lived there for several years. And I visited there from
                    Paris. I had some knowledge of the country. I met many Belgians during my time
                    in NATO. We lived in Brussels when I was at NATO. There was a lot of background
                    that I had to bring to the job.</p>

                <p>GLITMAN: The Chief of the Defense Staff accompanied me. I was, of course, told in
                    advance what would happen. They came to the residence, which was within walking
                    distance of the formal palace in Brussels. The King and the Queen didn't live
                    there; they live in a smaller palace in Laeken, just a little bit outside, a
                    nice little section of Brussels. He showed up with a very long Mercedes,
                    escorted by a horse cavalry unit. It was a short ride to the palace. We were
                    ushered in from the vehicle, taken up the formal staircase. The audience with
                    the King was held at that time. As I said before, I felt very strongly about
                    him; he was a wonderful person. The King represented Belgium extremely well,
                    along with the Queen. So we had a non-substantive talk, in a sense, but it was a
                    pleasant meeting. That was it. They escorted me back to the residence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your conversation in French or both in French and
                        English?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: I think we spoke in English mostly. I was very comfortable in French at
                    that point in my life; we could have done that. Both Chris and I also tried to
                    learn Dutch while we were there. And we made a little headway with that. It's a
                    language that is, sort of, half way between English and German in many
                    respects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you want to talk about some relationships, during
                        your service there, the King and the Queen, the royal family, aristocracy,
                        what was the relationship like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: It was obviously mostly on formal occasions. We were invited frequently
                    to events at which the King was present, and the Queen. On some occasions, there
                    were very few diplomats at these. Often we would go to music concerts,
                    particularly if an American orchestra was there. We always wanted to go to those
                    in order to try to make an arrangement to meet with the conductor and, if
                    possible, to arrange contact with the musicians at our residence. I know that
                    there was more than one occasion when the King and Queen were at one of these
                    concerts in Brussels. Chris and I would often be brought to the area where he
                    would be talking to people during the intermissions. So we would have a chance
                    to discuss that. I remember talking to him about Tiananmen Square, in China. He
                    raised it with me, and I discussed it a bit with him. And then before we left
                    Brussels, we went to the palace where they lived in Laeken, and we met with him
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Queen participate in any of these affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she speak English?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: I'm sure she did. Again, language wasn't an issue. Because I could go
                    back and forth between English and French easily. As I used to put it, I could
                    spend a whole day in French and wouldn't know the difference. It reached the
                    point where it was very comfortable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Belgian aristocracy? Was there any
                        opportunity for you to deal with them? Did they come to the embassy ever?
                        Was someone in the Foreign Ministry a count or a baron?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: People of that rank in the aristocracy were in all walks of life. They
                    were in the Foreign Ministry, banking, business, and finance, so you were with
                    them constantly. I think certainly many of them received titles as a result of
                    prominence and inventions. For example, I recall the Solvay family. They were
                    prominent in chemicals, and the initial founder had made a major chemical
                    discovery—I wish I could remember exactly what it was. They had continued to run
                    their business, but they also had wonderful estates. Some of them were quite
                    generous in making their places available for NATO meetings, etc. There were
                    some interesting stories of how they managed to survive the Second World War,
                    with their wine cellars intact. They were really just a part of regular life
                    fare for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your relationship with the Prime Minister, the
                        Foreign Minister, persons at the Foreign Ministry? Other Belgian government
                        figures?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: I saw a lot of them. Either we had a demarche to make or a request to
                    make of them. I often would go to see the Foreign Minister and occasionally the
                    Prime Minister. There was a lot of professional contact and a fair amount of
                    social contact as well. Likewise, there was contact with the Defense Minister
                    and the heads of the parties. And the journalists. We entertained at the
                    residence a lot. And we tried to bring in as many people from as many different
                    walks of life and many different types of activities as we could. We would often
                    have small events, Chris and myself, plus maybe the Prime Minister and his wife,
                    occasions like that. It was all part of normal work. Again, as I mentioned
                    before, there were a lot of business people as well that we'd meet frequently.
                    It's a fairly small country. Brussels is a relatively small city, so as American
                    ambassador, you get to meet just about everybody.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>I should say a word about the residence. The building was built in the late
                    1700s. We purchased it at a very nice price immediately after the Second World
                    War. In the process, we purchased, with the house, land behind it, which
                    actually fronts one of the main streets. That's where the office building went,
                    the Chancery. So we could walk from the residence to the Chancery, through the
                    basements, so to speak. You didn't even have to go outdoors. The downside was
                    that the office became an extension of the house. If you had any work to do late
                    at night, you'd just go on over there; it was no different than being in the
                    house, just a few more steps going down.</p>
                <p>The residence was a beautiful building. I think Americans should feel proud of
                    it. It really showed off the U.S. in a positive way. It was a Belgian building,
                    and we had taken a good care of it. It had been furnished very well over the
                    years; and while we were there maintenance continued. There were several large
                    reception rooms, all on ground floor. For cocktail parties or an occasional
                    musical evening (and rarely, but once in a while, a dance), it was set up so you
                    could handle all of those things. If you had a large number of people for
                    dinner, maybe a very large number of people for dinner or lunch, then the ball
                    room could be turned into a dining room with some round tables. You could
                    probably fit 100 people there, seated. Then there was another dinning room that
                    could seat about 20-30, separate from that larger room. There were two reception
                    rooms on the ground floor. These were formal reception rooms. They are all tied
                    in very nicely, permitting good circulation during a cocktail party, a
                    reception, or even at a dinner. It was easy for people to circulate from one
                    room to another. And there was a winter garden. This was glass-enclosed, the
                    roof is all glass, which was wonderful for a very small lunch or a
                    breakfast.</p>
                <p>And then there was a roof garden, which had fallen into certain amount of
                    disrepair, and the roof had to be redone. Chris went ahead and thought that
                    maybe it would be appropriate for a Japanese garden or something along those
                    lines. We had been to Japan earlier. So we worked that out, and it became even
                    more usable, that roof garden. Brussels is noted for its gray weather, but there
                    are plenty of nice days. This was a wonderful place to have someone over for
                    lunch, in the middle of the city. We could sit outside and it was quite private
                    where we were seated. There was only the Flemish social club across the street,
                    so somebody in one or two of those windows might see us, but otherwise, we were
                    quite private there. It was a fine building.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>I have to also point out, as sometimes you'd find a sense, or some people would
                    say, “Why do you have this great place?” And I had to make clear, and I will now
                    again, we didn't live in those wonderful reception rooms. We didn't even use the
                    smaller set of reception rooms on the second floor, which consisted of a
                    bedroom, a living room and a small dinning room. Those were all used for smaller
                    dinners or lunches, more intimate affairs. We lived on the third floor (in our
                    system of labeling floors—the second floor in European terminology). And
                    essentially we had a bedroom, an office/sitting room, and the TV; all that were
                    in a corridor. At the end of that corridor, we had a small kitchen and a little
                    table where we would have our meals on the weekends. We preferred not to have
                    staff on the weekend, and we'd ask them to prepare something in advance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there guest bedrooms?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: There were guest bedrooms available. The one on the second floor was the
                    most elegant room. It was all wood-paneled. Some guests preferred that. Then we
                    had a somewhat smaller room, also very nice, on the floor where we were. And
                    then up stairs again, the floor where normally the servants would stay, those
                    rooms were transformed into other bedrooms. I never counted how many people you
                    could house at any time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were among your distinguished guests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: We had lots of visitors come through and stay with us. Governors and the
                    Bush relatives stayed with us when they were on a business trip promoting U.S.
                    activities, so I though that was good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have a presidential visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: Yes, we did. That was with President Bush. Of course we all were deeply
                    involved with that. Chris was very much involved with Mrs. Bush's schedule, and
                    held a large luncheon at the residence, for Mrs. Bush. She asked, “What are Mrs.
                    Bush's interests?” We heard a few things back. Then she found out where in
                    Belgium we could find activities going on that corresponded to her interests.
                    Then she went and visited all of these places on her own, as the wife of the
                    American ambassador, interested in this activity. Was able to get some sense of
                    how it would work. After that she put together a schedule. People of course came
                    from Washington to do finishing touches, advance team, and so on. But she did
                    put a lot of effort into that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Congressional delegations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: Oh yes. Plenty of those. Again, they would come to NATO or the European
                    Union. There are three missions in Brussels. And one combined administrative
                    service, which was under me. We had to be careful, and I instructed the head of
                    the administrative side of the embassy to treat each one of these missions
                    equally and fairly. And we did our best to do so. In an inspection report,
                    inspectors wrote in a comment, in fact, during the period that I was there, that
                    it had been done well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about major incidents while you were there as
                        ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: There were two really large incidents, events, which occurred during the
                    time we were in Brussels. One of them was the end of the Cold War, the fall of
                    the Berlin Wall, and so on. And there were enormous questions raised about how
                    that would affect our relations with Europe. I commissioned a series of studies
                    to be done by the political section and one by the economic section on our
                    future relations in NATO. The first one I labeled, I called “Coping with
                    Success.” We knew how to win the Cold War, now can we win the peace? There were
                    large questions, such as “What's the future of NATO in this situation?” I felt
                    it ought to continue with the Europeans playing a larger role, if they could do
                    that. And what sort of new military arrangements should be set up between us and
                    the Europeans, etc? There were a whole host of issues like that. I did, as I
                    said, send several of these messages to Washington. I know they were well
                    received. At one point, I was asked to represent the U.S. at a meeting of
                    East-West foreign policy planners, from foreign ministries. Our planners, people
                    from our staff, couldn't make it from Washington, and I was called and asked,
                    “Would you please go?” And I did.</p>
                <p>As a sort of a side comment to that, I had been in Oberammergau talking to the
                    Defense Department military school there and there is a NATO operation there as
                    well now. Chris was with me and we thought we'd do some hiking, as it was a
                    weekend after I gave my talk. I got a phone call from Washington asking if I
                    would please go to a castle in Germany where a planning committee, policy
                    planners, was going to meet. I said, “Fine. My wife is here and I am not going
                    to ditch her.” We may not be able to do what we thought we were going to do, so
                    they said they would see what they could do, if they could find room for her to
                    join me at this castle. I said, “It's not a monastery, it's a castle, so there
                    ought to be a room.” It did work out, we both went there. She actually, since
                    these obviously weren't classified meetings, sat in on one of them. It was kind
                    of fun. Her comments afterwards were interesting and useful. In any case, that
                    really gave me an opportunity to see how policy planners throughout Europe, both
                    East and West, were approaching this change at the end of the Cold War. I won't
                    go into all the details of it. Again, I did send a reporting message to
                    Washington after the session. The end of the Cold War was an event that took up
                    a lot of our time.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>The second major event was the Gulf War. Here our main concern—actually there
                    were two concerns—was to insure Belgian cooperation as we moved equipment
                    through Belgium. I had no doubt they would do it, and they did. They did it
                    splendidly and, as I mentioned earlier, this is another example of where
                    military-to-military contact was the right way to go. After having cleared the
                    way on the political side, again not encountering any obstacles, we turned it
                    over to the military, and they managed it. Things flowed through Belgium as they
                    were supposed to.</p>
                <p>I can also say that we were concerned about terrorist activities. Again, I worked
                    with the Belgian Ministry of Interior, and they did a fine job. To underscore
                    that point, the war actually began late at night, after we had gone to bed. I
                    had talked to the Minister of the Interior earlier that day about the need to
                    look after American property, as we could be targets, and likewise for Americans
                    in general. The way we knew that the war had begun was that we heard the police
                    outside our windows setting up barriers in the street. That's how good Belgian
                    security was and how quick they were. And they had done that elsewhere. I think
                    that too was an interesting period.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A subject that has been left off in most interviews, but
                        which we should cover with senior officers, and particularly ambassadors, is
                        their role in arms sales. How much was it used as a tool of making the
                        country happy? How much was it a matter of selling American goods and what
                        was the effect of these arms sales in the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: Well, in the case of Belgium, a NATO ally, it was a reason for us to try
                    to make arms sales. Essentially, the reasons were two-fold. One, we were in an
                    alliance together, and it's in our interest—and in the interests of the other
                    countries—that in the Alliance all of us be equipped with the best materials,
                    weapons, and arms systems available. So I did work hard, with the defense
                    attach�s and often directly with the defense minister and others to try to
                    assure, for example, if the Belgians were trying to replace some electronic
                    gear, that the American companies would have a fair shot at the market. The same
                    circumstance applied (in a different way) for working out arrangements with the
                    Belgians. They almost always wanted some Belgian company to have some part to
                    play in this purchase. That was a relationship that had to be taken into
                    account. I didn't negotiate these agreements myself, but the military did or
                    officials would come from Washington. They were technical talk addressing the
                    terms of what type of equipment would work best. I also worked hard to persuade
                    the Belgians of the importance of keeping their equipment up to date. For
                    example, I urged giving their pilots enough time to fly their airplanes. In that
                    connection, I did fly on an American F-16. I was able to come back and tell the
                    Defense Minister first hand, that their pilots were not meeting NATO standards.
                    I think it is 120 hours of flying time a year. And my own personal reaction to
                    being in that aircraft was that the complexity of the weapons systems was so
                    great that the flying part had to be automatic. So if you were not flying a lot,
                    you really couldn't do your job. I don't know if that persuaded him in any way,
                    but it did have, I hope, some positive impact. He seemed to understand what I
                    was saying.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>I also accompanied the Chief of Staff and the Defense Minister on to the USS
                    Eisenhower. Again, it was designed to demonstrate how we must have up to date
                    equipment. We were not selling them any ships; that wasn't the point. But it was
                    done to give them a sense of the U.S. presence. Some interesting things came out
                    of that trip too, especially when I sensed some growing concern by some of the
                    Europeans, about what was happening on the Mediterranean side of the European
                    Union. This was particularly true regarding North Africa. That appreciation also
                    came from that trip.</p>
                <p>All of this activity was designed to give us a fair crack at it the arms sales
                    market. We were trying to sell them helicopters, but the contract went to the
                    Italians. It later developed that there were accusations made against the
                    Defense Minister and some of his political colleagues, that they had perhaps
                    been influenced too much by the Italians, shall we say. I don't know how the
                    court case ended, but they did go to court. It was a sad ending in a way.</p>
                <p>I think the basic point is that it's perfectly legitimate for American
                    ambassadors and senior officials to try to support American industry in this
                    manner. It's not as if we were forcing this equipment on them. If we didn't make
                    the sale, the French or the Germans or the British or the Italians would. Our
                    main point was to make sure that we got a crack at the market.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your general relationship with defense attach�s?
                        Problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: Over the course of the years, I had frequent contacts with them, I had
                    close contacts with them, beginning especially in Paris when Dick Walters was
                    there as Defense Attach� for part of the time. And we exchanged notes on how we
                    were approaching these problems. We did work as a team. There were things he
                    could get into, being military, that I couldn't, and there were some things that
                    I could get into as a civilian, both with the Foreign Ministry and the Defense
                    Ministry, that would have been more difficult for him to do. But we were all on
                    the same team. I worked again with them in Brussels. Certainly at NATO when I
                    was DCM, half of my staff was military. I enjoyed working with them. I think as
                    I said before, they have a very positive attitude about getting things done. It
                    doesn't mean that they overdo it, but they are generally easy to work with. At
                    least I found it so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned your DCM. Would you tell us a bit about
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: I meant myself as DCM at NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At any rate, here at this embassy setting, you had a
                        DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: I had two DCMs, both are good friends, were before and still are. Ron
                    Woods was a DCM when I arrive at embassy Brussels. He and his wife Judy. We had
                    been in Paris together with them, so we knew them from there. They both did a
                    splendid job representing the U.S. and served the embassy well while we were
                    there. Ron went on to become DCM at London, a later assignment. Don McConnell
                    and his wife Francis had been with us at NATO; when I was at NATO Don was on the
                    staff there. They came and worked with us on the INF negotiations. When Ron was
                    leaving, I had to make a choice. Another very able person who was with me in
                    Brussels at the time was also a candidate. I like to pick people who don't
                    necessarily act, react the way I do. I don't want someone reinforcing some of my
                    habits, I want someone who looks at things differently, but Don I think is a
                    very calm and thoughtful person. I wanted someone like that around me. I chose
                    him and he came. His wife, Francis also with him. We still stay in touch. It
                    worked out well. He stayed on with my replacement, Ambassador Gelb.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there were two people, Ron Woods, and Don McConnell?
                        Alright. How about a few words on your representational allowance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: We certainly used all that was allocated to us. The embassy gets a lump
                    sum, and then it's up to the ambassador to distribute that. How much does the
                    ambassador take of that, how much for the DCM? Then for the main sections,
                    political, economic and others, eventually it gets down to the junior officers,
                    and as I mentioned, when we were in Paris we were at the bottom of that line. At
                    Brussels, we had enough. I have to say that I hope my colleagues thought they
                    had a sufficient allowance. As far as I can recall, we certainly never had
                    anything left over, but I think we had enough for what we were doing. I wouldn't
                    complain about it in this case. I don't want to generalize, because I think in
                    some posts they don't get enough. Certainly in our earlier days, Nassau, places
                    like that, probably could have used a little more. But I have no complaints
                    about it so far as Brussels is concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about, as we are winding down on the ambassadorship in
                        Brussels, any other comments about your embassy chancery or embassy
                        residence? Anecdotes, whatever?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: Our residence, as I mentioned, is a superb building, and it helped the
                    American image that we were in that building and that we keep it up as well as
                    we have. I also noted that it was possible for me to go from the residence into
                    the chancery without going outside. Well, also the incident there involving our
                    dog Hercules demonstrates this ease of passage. Actually, the passage was not so
                    easy. There were people watching me; Marines could see me. You didn't just walk
                    through. In any case, Chris and I were off somewhere, I don't recall where, and
                    when we got back we heard that Hercules had somehow managed to walk out of the
                    residence and into the chancery, the office building, and wound up in the
                    cafeteria, where he was busily caging food from everybody. After the initial
                    shock, he was taken back, but that led to quite an investigation regarding how
                    he managed to get through the building. It was a security issue. Anyway, that
                    was another aspect of living near the office building.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the social life at Brussels, diplomatic corps,
                        NATO, and life in Brussels in general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: Social life, as you might imagine, was constant. It was either a lunch
                    or a dinner; if you were not giving one, you were going to one. As I tried to
                    point out earlier, by and large it is work in another form and another forum.
                    You are always trying to figure out how you can best make use of this event to
                    forward U.S. interests—either in gathering information or in disseminating U.S.
                    position and views. Or a combination of those objectives. Because most of the
                    countries, or many, had three missions as we did, a mission to Belgium, a
                    mission to NATO, and a mission to the European Union, that just multiplied the
                    number of contacts and people involved in the diplomatic life. I had, as you
                    know, worked in NATO and throughout the INF negotiations had been worked very
                    closely with people at NATO or at capitals who would later find themselves at
                    NATO. Earlier when I was doing trade work, I had a lot to do with the European
                    Union. So we knew a lot of people who were at those two organizations as well.
                    As a consequence, we spent a fair amount of time being invited to NATO events.
                    For example, Secretary General W�rner had us several times to his place at NATO.
                    He was a wonderful man; he was a great supporter of the Alliance. Unfortunately,
                    he was not able to fill his full term at NATO; he died, very sadly.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>Again as I pointed out earlier, we already lived once in Brussels. So we pretty
                    well knew our way around. The forest, For�t de Soignes that I mentioned earlier,
                    wasn't at our back door any longer, but we did have vehicles available. We
                    didn't bring a car to Brussels. It made no sense to have our own car because of
                    the terrorism problem. The last thing you wanted to do was to have the same
                    vehicle all the time. So, we would take vehicles from the embassy motor pool. We
                    could then drive to the forest if we wanted. Basically, you went to the coast,
                    or you went to the Ardennes, or you stayed around Brussels—those were your main
                    choices. You could drive to Paris in a day, but it is a pretty full drive. You
                    can get to Holland or over to Aachen. It was possible to do day trips, and we
                    did a fair number of those on weekends. The one thing that I did work out was
                    that I would use a different vehicle every weekend. We had no fixed itinerary on
                    the weekend. We didn't know where we were going until we got into the car. The
                    cars were either on the street next to the residence and the chancery (at the
                    street there, about one block long) or they would put one in the basement of the
                    chancery for me. The Marines would open the gate, lower the draw bridges, and
                    then we'd shoot out. But I used a different vehicle, and I got to know lots of
                    them. Including, on one occasion, the electrician had a little station wagon. It
                    was okay. We took that one weekend. I could have taken the Cadillac with the
                    body guards, and some of my predecessors had traveled that way, but I thought
                    (a) I want some privacy, and (b) why pay for a driver? I though I had an equal
                    chance by mixing up which vehicle we were taking and turning different
                    directions. The alternative would have been to drive around with what I referred
                    to as the “bull's eye,” a big black Cadillac. Because you can't sit in the
                    “bull's eye” all the time, eventually you get to the coast or in the forest, you
                    park it and get out and walk, anyway. The whole scene of chauffeurs with body
                    guards was more than we wanted to put up with; so we took our chances.
                    Fortunately, we are still here to talk about it.</p>
                <p>We had seen a lot of Belgium. On our last weekend, we got out our Michelin Green
                    Guide. “Where shall we go?” We could not find a place that was mentioned in
                    there that we hadn't been to. I forget what we eventually chose.</p>
                <p>There also was a lot of music in Brussels. As I said before, I like music a lot.
                    We had many opportunities to enjoy it in Brussels. We had Rostropovich and his
                    wife to lunch, along with one of our Belgian friends who had been ambassador to
                    Moscow and was, at that point, head of one of the largest banks in Belgium. He
                    was a remarkable man. Like many Belgians, he had excellent language skills. I
                    don't know how many languages he spoke, but Belgians are very good at
                    languages.</p>
                <p>I don't know if I told you about how strong and good they were at commerce. I am
                    sure I did tell you about chocolate. We also got to see the scientific
                    activities that they were doing: environmental control; environmental clean-up;
                    things that we now know must have put them ahead of their time. Different plants
                    would take up certain chemicals and noxious, dangerous toxic chemicals, so you
                    could grow some plants and not others; it was using nature to clean itself up.
                    Very recently things are going on in this direction in the U.S.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Certainly in theses times, an ambassador must consider
                        terrorism. Can we have some words in this regard, especially on this issue:
                        How recognizable would an ambassador be in a setting such as Brussels in
                        Belgium?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: Given the size of the community, the answer is, especially if you are
                    the American ambassador, very, very recognizable. We would often be out on the
                    street or on the coast, for example, walking on the beach, and people would say
                    hello. We didn't necessarily recognize them all the time. You have to sort of
                    live with that. Or people sort of looking at you. They must know who you are,
                    even if they don't say hello. I had been on television two or three times,
                    discussing the Gulf War, for example; and an earlier talk show; and on radio as
                    well. We would do it in French, of course, but with the Dutch language service,
                    they had it translated. But you would become known from that as well. And there
                    were many speeches around town, for example, with the Belgian-American society
                    or U.S. Chamber of Commerce; speaking was a pretty constant activity that would
                    get me out of the embassy. You had to do your job. You just do it. I grew up in
                    a large city so I had a certain amount of street-smarts. That was with me all
                    the time. I never felt particularly stressed because of it, but I was always
                    very careful.</p>
                <p>I should just note that one of the people, who replaced me eventually in a job,
                    the second person who replaced me at the job I had in the embassy in Paris had
                    been followed by terrorists. We knew that. I won't go into how that was figured
                    out, but to associate with that, other people had been shot at in Paris. This
                    was after we had left there. But these events bring home the fact that so many
                    of our colleagues are subject to terrorist attacks. It does bring it home. There
                    were, while we were there, a number of events in Brussels, including bombings of
                    diplomats. Not Americans, these were Arabs, I think, being bombed—Arab embassy
                    people. Nevertheless, as a consequence, I suggested to Washington that we really
                    ought to take a much closer look at Belgium. It wasn't that we were a target,
                    but it was becoming obvious that terrorists were operating in the city, in
                    Brussels, and also, more generally, in Belgium. We did take a hard look at it
                    and raised the level of security, because if they can have troubles amongst
                    themselves, they can also come after us.</p>
                <p>One other point. After you live that way for a while, it's very hard to stop
                    looking under the car for bombs. When we came home, there was a transition
                    period during which I would find myself, unthinking, routinely, checking the car
                    out. Chris would say, “You don't need to do this any longer.” Eventually, I got
                    more or less over it. I still keep the doors locked when we leave the car.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you know, generally speaking, do our ambassadors go
                        through this in Oslo and Helsinki and Ankara, or does it vary widely?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: I think it certainly varies. If you are in certain places where there is
                    a record of anti-American terrorist activity, you definitely are on your toes.
                    But if you were in Kenya or Dar es Salaam, you might not have expected anything,
                    and that's of course where it hit, in its worst form. A lot depends on the
                    individual, I suppose. How do you approach this threat? You see, my own approach
                    was to live as normal a life as I could. But, I was on guard all the time. I
                    tried not to be careless. Again, having grown up in a large city at least, you
                    get that feel for what streets you really shouldn't turn down. You just need to
                    look at it and say, “I am not going down this street, there is something about
                    it. I may be wrong, but my instincts say stop.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who replaced you as ambassador in Brussels?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: Gelb, Bruce S. Gelb. And Bruce Gelb had been the head of USIA. He went
                    to Brussels and was replaced by Henry E. Catto, Jr., who was ambassador in
                    London.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me check dates here. You were appointed ambassador to
                        Belgium July 15, 1988; you presented credentials on September, 28, 1988.
                        What year did you leave post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: In June 1991. It was a three-year assignment, and that was close enough
                    to three years. We could talk a little bit about what happened afterwards?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: We had been overseas at this point for quite some time. As you know, I
                    felt we hadn't gone overseas quickly enough when we came in, but at this point,
                    we had been overseas for a while. The children were all more or less grown, but
                    still, we missed opportunities to see them as often as we would like. I reached
                    the point where I still didn't want very much to work in Washington. But at the
                    same time, we really didn't want to go overseas again. So, I ended with a
                    diplomat in residence assignment. Even there, Chris and I talked a bit about
                    going to the University of Washington. We'd never been to the Northwest, but
                    thought that we would like it and thought that maybe we would spend an academic
                    year there. But, both of us concluded that we had moved enough at this point,
                    and it was time to get closer to home, namely Vermont. So I offered to go there.
                    Director General Perkins was delighted that I chose Vermont because that was
                    just the kind of place he wanted people to go: not to Ivy League schools and not
                    in Washington area. We basically came home to Vermont. After that, the longer we
                    stayed, the harder it was to go away. That's basically where we ended up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were Diplomat in Residence at the University of
                        Vermont?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>GLITMAN: Correct. That's where we stayed. I had one year, then I had a second
                    year at it, and 1992 was an election year so nobody was going to move
                    anywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were here as Diplomat in Residence in 1991-92?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: Yes. Academic years. We stayed here a little longer, and eventually I
                    retired here. We were home at that point. We had a house in Washington, and
                    eventually we sold that. That really was the final break.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I note in your curriculum vitae that you have some awards
                        for meritorious service, distinguished public service, etc. Would you
                        comment for us on these awards?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: Certainly. The Presidential Distinguished Public Service Award, which I
                    received in 1989, was essentially for my work on INF. The Presidential
                    Meritorious Service Awards in 1987 and 1984 had to do with NATO and, therefore,
                    to some extent were also with the INF activity. I had two medals from the
                    Department of Defense, during my time there. One in 1980 had to with my work on
                    NATO issues. I am pleased that these are bi-partisan medals. The first one was
                    from Donald Rumsfeld, who was Secretary of Defense. The second one, the
                    Meritorious Service Medal, in 1981, was presented by Harold Brown when he was
                    the Secretary of Defense. And that was largely my work at NATO. The 1988 Joseph
                    C. Wilson Award, which is presented by the University of Rochester and the
                    Rochester Association for the UN, is an award that is given once a year to the
                    public servant who in their view made the greatest contribution to world peace
                    and world progress. As you can see, the award is in recognition of
                    “distinguished and creative efforts to promote world peace.” That also was for
                    INF. Those are the major ones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you see the Foreign Service as a career today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: I'll answer that the way I answer my students. If you want to spend a
                    major portion of your professional life working on foreign policy issues, in the
                    field and/or back in Washington, then the Foreign Service as a career today is
                    still a viable career. If you want to get to the top quickly, I would suggest
                    you go into business or politics. Make a lot of money and buy yourself an
                    ambassadorship. And, here is the beauty part. Lately, ambassadorships had been
                    going for about $300,000/year. The job is now paying about $140,000/year. You
                    get it for three years; you re-coop your expenses; and you come out ahead. I
                    tell the students that. But you won't have spent your whole life doing this;
                    you'd have spent your whole life on something else to accumulate the money so
                    you could be an ambassador.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>So, for an ordinary person—someone who wants to work in the field of foreign
                    policy—the Foreign Service is an excellent option. It's not the only option. You
                    can get into the civil service, and find jobs in foreign policy. And certainly
                    you can get it in the military. We've had more than one general become Secretary
                    of State. It's a different path, but you will find yourself engaged in foreign
                    policy in the military as well. You would have to do some other things first, as
                    a lieutenant, and so on, but eventually you could spend a good deal of your time
                    in military service on international issues.</p>
                <p>Let me give you an example of how things could work out. We've just gone through
                    a serious crisis with China. Who were the three main players on the U.S. side in
                    this crisis, the president aside? General Powell, Admiral Clear in China, and
                    Mr. Armitage, another former military officer in the State Department as well.
                    So there you have it. The first crisis of the Bush administration, and all three
                    of the key players, and there might be others that I don't know about, I am only
                    going with what I could see in the press—three key players on the U.S. side were
                    all former military. So, it is not an option that you should ignore; if you want
                    to get into foreign policy, it's a viable one. But if you don't want to go that
                    route, and again I say, if you want to spend your working life in foreign
                    affairs, the Foreign Service is still a viable option. There are a lot of things
                    that need to be improved—the least of which is to find some way to put a cap on
                    political appointees.</p>
                <p>The 1980 Foreign Service Act (although I don't have it in front of me) quite
                    specifically singles out campaign contributions as something that must not be
                    taken into account. It seems to me that a contribution of $300,000 followed by
                    an appointment is prima facie evidence that the money in fact did influence the
                    appointment. That seems to me to be contrary to the law. The law also says that,
                    by and large, Foreign Service officers should be appointed ambassadors and, from
                    time to time, other highly qualified people might also become ambassadors. We
                    need to ask ourselves whether that clause of the law is being appropriately
                    administered. Those are some of the frustrations you'd face if you chose Foreign
                    Service. But, I still think that for many people it's the best way to get into
                    area of enormous importance to our country and to the world, as well as being
                    interesting work for oneself in the process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything you want to add?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLITMAN: There is a French phrase: L'Esprit de l'Escalier, which effectively is
                    usually translated as sort of the feeling you have as you are walking down the
                    staircase after having had a conversation with someone and saying, “Oops, I wish
                    I had thought of that!” In this case, I had a couple of those. More than a
                    couple, but they'll be brief.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>First, on the “undertakings.” I went on about that at some length about that
                    particular word having been introduced into the treaty. I was looking through my
                    copy of the treaty, and I couldn't find it. But I did find it at home. Just to
                    try to make clear the issue here. The SALT II treaty has an article in it,
                    Article 13, which says “Each party undertakes not to assume any international
                    obligations which would conflict with this treaty.” What happened in the INF
                    treaty, in Article 14, was to add a word to that basic argument, and was that
                    new word, I was confident, would attract the attention of the senators. So
                    Article 14 of the INF treaty reads, “The party shall comply with the treaty and
                    shall not assume any international obligations or undertakings which would
                    conflict with its provisions.” See, “undertakings” appears to add another
                    category of activities which would conflict with the treaty. My concern was that
                    this could be pointed by the Soviets, directly at our programs of cooperation on
                    nuclear weapons with our allies. In fact, as I think I may have pointed out, I
                    was questioned quite extensively on the fact that this word had been put there.
                    The individual who was primary source of that word, who put the word in there,
                    escaped any questions on that issue.</p>
                <p>Another small point. I mentioned a special commission set up to deal with
                    verification; I think I called it the SCC. That has a similar task, but not for
                    INF. It's the SVC, Special Verification Commission that we set up for INF.</p>
                <p>You had asked me if any of my Fletcher classmates had ended in the Foreign
                    Service, and I named a couple. I inadvertently left out Peter Lande, who went
                    into the economic side. Our paths never crossed after we joined the Foreign
                    Service; it was one of those odd things.</p>
                <p>Another thing I wanted to discuss a bit is to give you a flavor of some of the
                    problems we had in trying to get the Soviets to sit down and seriously negotiate
                    with us. I referred to some of the Ambassador Obukhov's commentaries as
                    “numbologues,” numbing monologues. He had this tendency, as I had said earlier
                    and as I had been forewarned, to do that. On one occasion, he really did go on
                    and on. I just decided to put an end to this. After he finished, I went on and
                    on and on in a similar vein, and then I said, “As you can see, I can do that
                    too, but there was really no value in this for either of us.” So I said, “Let's
                    agree now that unless we are making real progress, these post-plenary
                    discussions will end at one o'clock p.m. And Obukhov agreed. Nevertheless, on
                    one occasion, as the clock was ticking off, he said to Medvedev in Russian,
                    which our interpreter of course picked up and whispered to us, he said “It's ten
                    minutes until one. Keep on talking and use up all the remaining time.” I called
                    him on that as well, and told him we don't need to play games here. Also,
                    someone on the Soviet delegation told one of our team, during that endless
                    post-plenary, that Obukhov was probably the source of the drawn-out session, and
                    indeed he was.</p>
                <p>I mentioned the wave of immigrants coming to us in Nassau. I think I related it
                    to the Bay of Pigs, but, of course, it was the fall of the Batista government
                    and the arrival of Castro that really set this off.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>And lastly, I have to say, that while I did make a comment about Cubs not being
                    any better then than they are today, in retrospect I was wrong. The Cubs were
                    much better then, and they had won the National League Pennant, I believe, in
                    1945. Thank you.</p>
