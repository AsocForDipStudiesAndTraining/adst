                <p>AMBASSADOR EDWARD DRUMRIGHT</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Hank Zivetz </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: July 27, 1989</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, in your original interview with Lee
                        Cotterman, you traced your diplomatic career starting in Shanghai in 1935,
                        through your last post as chief of mission in Taipei in 1958 through 1962.
                        In the course of your career, you met and worked with many fascinating
                        people, figures who made and moved history. Could we today discuss some of
                        these people in greater length and depth and, in the process, get a more
                        subjective view of events?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Starting in Shanghai, who were the Americans and Chinese with whom you came in
                    contact and who left an impression, positive or negative?</p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: As for Shanghai, of course, in the consulate general we had Edwin S.
                    Cunningham. He had been consul general there for almost 20 years when I came
                    onto the post. He was an old line officer. He came from Tennessee. He was
                    basically a treaty port type, having lived in Shanghai all those years. I think
                    he was a hard-working officer, and he certainly devoted himself to looking after
                    American interests there.</p>
                <p>He was followed by Nathaniel Davis, an interim appointee, who later was
                    ambassador to Israel. Davis was a hard-working officer, but hadn't enough time
                    there to make much of a mark.</p>
                <p>He was followed by Clarence E. Gauss, who had a long career in China, albeit one
                    that was limited to the treaty ports. By “treaty ports,” I mean those cities
                    along the coast of China. Gauss had a legal mind. In fact, he wrote a consular
                    manual, a legal manual, for the Service that was followed for years. He was much
                    onto his consular work. He was conscientious and very hard working, but he
                    seemed, to me, never to penetrate much into the Chinese mind. He had never made
                    a study of China, as far as I could see, or studied the language or the history
                    of the culture. He was mostly intent on his work as a consular officer. Later,
                    of course, as I think I mentioned in my previous interview, he became ambassador
                    to China in Chungking, and spent about three years there. I think he was a
                    superb consul general, but he wasn't cut out, in my opinion, for the job of
                    being ambassador because of his limitations in knowledge of the Chinese and what
                    made the tick.</p>
                <p>I think that covers—</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In terms of contact in the consulate general, in addition
                        to taking care of American interests, I believe this was the time that the
                        Japanese were intruding themselves into China. Did you have occasion to come
                        in contact with any of the Japanese who had an impact on Chinese history at
                        this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I knew a consul in the Japanese consulate general, and I've forgotten
                    his name [ed. note: “Terry” Terasaki who later served as interpreter in the
                    meeting between MacArthur and Emperor Hirohito]. It's been a long time ago, 40
                    or 50 years ago. He was married to an American girl, by the way, and I think it
                    was his idea to try to resolve differences between the Japanese and the
                    Americans. But, of course, later he was reassigned to the foreign ministry in
                    Tokyo, and I think he was onto that kind of work. But as you know, the Japanese
                    are not a people you get to know very well. They live unto themselves mostly,
                    and I didn't have many contacts with Japanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the differences between the Chinese factions?
                        Was this apparent in Shanghai in this period, and was there any contact with
                        Kuomintang leaders or communist leaders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: We, in the consulate, had, through our position, contact with the
                    mayor of Shanghai, who at that time was a man named Chung. Chung later became
                    Secretary General of the Kuomintang, so he was a party man. But I could say that
                    Shanghai was somewhat out of the center of political happenings and events in
                    those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting. What happened in Hangzhou? What was
                        the situation there, and who were some of the personalities that you came
                        into contact in that position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I had two assignments to Hangzhou. When I went there first in
                    1932—that is more than 57 years ago—Walter A. Adams was the consul general. He
                    was not what we would call an old China hand, even though he spent some years in
                    China. He did not pursue the language or seem to make much of a study of China,
                    and, in fact, when I had a chance to go to Peking to study Chinese, I asked him
                    what his view was, and he suggested it would be better if I didn't do it. As a
                    consular officer, I think he was a good one. He was not married at that time,
                    although he did get married later. He played a lot of bridge and he went to the
                    club. He enjoyed himself in his post there.</p>
                <p>For the second assignment there, when I went to the consulate general, we had
                    Paul R. Josselyn. Paul was a China language officer and was a good officer, but
                    he suffered from ill health and was not, therefore, very active.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>As for activities in Hangzhou, there weren't very many during my first
                    assignment, which lasted less than one year. I was actually onto economic work
                    mostly there, submitting reports monthly and, in between, interim reports to the
                    commercial attach�, who had his office in Shanghai.</p>
                <p>My second assignment there came as the Japanese were stepping up their activities
                    in China, and, in fact, within a few months of my arrival there in July of 1937,
                    the war started. From then on, our whole activities were devoted in one way or
                    another to wartime efforts, such as repatriating our citizens and reporting on
                    conditions back there in the west and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From Hangzhou, you moved to Chungking for a three-year
                        period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I was in Hangzhou—well, I went there in March of '37 on a temporary
                    assignment, by the way, that time. I expected to go back to Shanghai. But, of
                    course, the war came and my assignment was made permanent. I continued to serve
                    there and joined the embassy. I went over from the consulate general to the
                    embassy, I think about February of 1938, on the recommendation of the
                    ambassador, Nelson T. Johnson. The embassy had its office in the consulate
                    general, so we were working closely together, in any case. Of course, we stayed
                    there until the first of August of '38, when after the Chinese government had
                    removed its capital for the second time, its temporary capital, first to
                    Hangzhou and then to Chungking, the embassy had to follow on. So we left about
                    the first of August on one of our US Navy gunboats, and went up to
                    Chungking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My knowledge of what was happening there at that period
                        comes mainly from Teddy White's book. But it was replete with all of these
                        names that later became so important in the events of China and the
                        relationships. Did you have contact with any of these people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Are you speaking of Chinese or American?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chinese and Americans, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: First of all, Nelson Johnson and Willis R. Peck headed our mission up
                    there. Johnson stayed as ambassador there until about April of '41, when he was
                    replaced by Gauss. Willis Peck was the counselor and remained there. He was an
                    old China hand, by the way. He knew the language well. He had come of a
                    missionary family in China and was well versed in the Chinese, was very useful
                    to the ambassador, who also, by the way, was a language officer, one of the
                    first who had served in Peking as a language officer starting in 1906, I
                    believe. So those two men were language officers. They got on very well with the
                    Chinese officialdom and other Chinese. They knew them, knew how to deal with
                    them, they could talk with them, and they got along with the top-flight Chinese
                    such as Chiang Kai-shek and the foreign minister, a Mr. Wong, at that time. We
                    had close contact, in other words, with the Chinese officials. We were
                    sympathetic to their cause. We wanted them to come out on top in their defense
                    against this Japanese aggression, and so we supported them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I recall correctly, the communists were also, for a
                        time, in Chungking.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: They had a representative. They had a small representative's office in
                    Chungking all throughout the war period. Their number-one there was a well-known
                    Chinese by the name of Zhou En-lai. We knew him. I knew him fairly well. I made
                    contact with him as early as 1939. I used to invite him and some of his cohorts
                    up to my residence on a weekend, and we would have long talks on the situation,
                    with Zhou, of course, seeking to obtain our sympathy for the cause of the
                    communists and so forth, naturally; that was his business.</p>
                <p>Yes, we knew them, and we knew fairly well what they were doing. We reported on
                    the imbroglio between the government and the communists, and I think, in
                    general, we reported it pretty honestly and carefully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Zhou as a political
                        leader?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: He was a very adroit fellow. He could get along with anybody if he
                    wished to. I always had a friendly relationship with him, except the last time I
                    ever saw him, which was in the fall of 1944, when I had come back from an
                    assignment up in the area not far from where the communists were hanging out. On
                    that occasion, he invited me to lunch and we talked about the situation. It was
                    a crucial period with the government weakening, because there had been some
                    Japanese offensives, a couple of them, one in Central China and one in South
                    China, which had brought the Chinese to a fairly dangerous pass. Well, I said I
                    felt that we should be getting more support from the communists in this, and why
                    didn't they work more together? Well, that angered Zhou. [Laughter] He virtually
                    walked out on me.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>But I'll have to say, he later became the prime minister of China under the
                    communists, and if there was a moderate communist around, I think Zhou was it. I
                    often wonder how he ever managed to get through all those years with Mao Zedong.
                    Mao, of course, was at the opposite pole. He was a very radical type, who had no
                    accommodation for anyone who wasn't a communist and who wouldn't follow the
                    line. So there we had Zhou, I know on many occasions, helped people who were in
                    trouble with the communists, and I think, in general, he was moderate where he
                    could be in operating the government, but that couldn't have been very much
                    because of Mao and his overall policies, which were extraordinary radical.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this Chungking period, at least some of the literature
                        is highly critical of Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist Government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Well, if you know the media, if you know those writers and people—you
                    mentioned White; he was one of them—and most of the others, there were a few
                    objective reporters up there. But by and large, the people you would read were
                    those who seemed to sympathize with the communists. I think perhaps in many
                    cases it was not a question of being pro-communist, as such; it was just that
                    they felt that the government had failed. And it was weak, as I said.</p>
                <p>But I think they failed to take into account the bitterness, the length, the
                    horrible happenings of the war. That is to say, the Chinese took on a very
                    strong foe, as we found out later ourselves, and it was a foe that was
                    determined to conquer China in one way or another, and they put well over a
                    million men into that effort in China, with their first-class military equipment
                    and the like, and generals and so on. The Chinese, I think, wisely, under Chiang
                    Kai-shek's management, just withdrew where they couldn't continue the scrap on
                    the front lines.</p>
                <p>I think Chiang made a mistake in the early days when he threw his forces into the
                    defense of the Shanghai area. This was bound to fail with the tremendous
                    Japanese offensive that took place. I think after that, Chiang learned that he
                    had to fall back where the Japanese attacked in strong force, which they would,
                    but he would hold the line wherever he could, and he did that all over the place
                    from north to south, with very little in terms of aid or assistance, and without
                    any industry to back him up, to speak of, and with an economy that was barely
                    able to feed its people.</p>
                <p>It was really quite a saga, in my opinion. I just feel that many of our people
                    could not appreciate the efforts that the Chinese went through to support that
                    war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you privy to any of the consulate between General
                        Stilwell and Chiang Kai-shek?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I knew in a general way. I had known Stilwell. I had met him in Peking
                    when I was a language officer. He had been a language officer there, too, before
                    me, of course. He was older. Then he happened to be military attach� when the
                    war came on. But he seemed to spend most of his time in Peking, which was behind
                    the lines. Peking was taken in the first days of the war by the Japanese,
                    occupied by them. He didn't seem, as I recall it, to come out behind the lines
                    to where the Chinese were—I'm speaking of Hangzhou now—until he was being
                    relieved, which was in, I believe, the late spring of 1938. Somehow he had not
                    endeared himself to Chiang. I'm not quite clear on the circumstances. But when
                    he came out, as I recall it, in 1938 to bid farewell to his Chinese military
                    friends, he wanted to call on Chiang Kai-shek, we tried to arrange a call
                    through the embassy, and I recall that we were never able to effect it, which
                    indicated to me that Chiang had no interest in even seeing Stilwell at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>So it was not until—when?—1941, '42, that he was sent out there at the instance
                    of General Marshall, I'm sure. They were old friends and buddies. Well, Stilwell
                    was a language officer in China, he'd been out there as attach�. I suppose it
                    seemed quite natural to assume that he was the logical choice for the job. But
                    I'm afraid somebody back there didn't take into account that there was no love
                    lost between Chiang and Stilwell, and that was certainly proved after Stilwell
                    came out there. He had, of course, been in Burma, in charge of the forces in
                    Burma, and had suffered some pretty severe losses. When he came to Chungking as
                    chief of staff, I think they called the job he was to take, but I don't believe
                    he ever served that job effectively. [Chuckles] He was always wanting to go back
                    to reconquer Burma and that sort of thing. He seemed to think that was
                    preeminent over fighting the Japanese out there on the east front. This was a
                    position with which I'm sure Chiang Kai-shek was strongly against.
                    [Chuckles]</p>
                <p>Well, anyway, I think history has proven, or shown, that it was an unfortunate
                    appointment. It never worked out, and the two men and their staffs never worked
                    together. That situation was not corrected until they sent Al Wedemeyer toward
                    the end of '44, when they recalled Stilwell. I think Pat Hurley had come out as
                    a special representative of Roosevelt and had looked the situation over. On the
                    basis of his assessment, he had recommended Stilwell be withdrawn. I think it
                    was a wise assessment and recommendation. It was carried out, and Al Wedemeyer
                    came, and he immediately set things right. They really started working very
                    closely with the Chinese in cooperation. Chiang sought his advice, and he saw
                    Chiang frequently, and they exchanged views and opinions. It was a complete
                    turnaround.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't there at the time that Wedemeyer came
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I was there when he first arrived. I was there for a month or two,
                    but, of course, Gauss was recalled, also, then. As I said in my first report,
                    Gauss was not sympathetic to the government. He felt that they had failed and
                    were failing, they wouldn't fight or didn't fight, and he had no use for all
                    that in his mind. He believed that it would be better, perhaps, to try to join
                    forces with the communists. Now, that was an opinion shared by some of the other
                    officers in our embassy and some with Stilwell. Vincent was there and George
                    Atcheson, for a while. I think Atcheson first, and then Vincent. Vincent went
                    back and became the director of the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were interned by the Japanese in Shanghai. Did you go
                        from Chungking to Shanghai?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I explained that in my first report. I flew. We had an air service
                    actually run by an American outfit, from Chungking to Hong Kong. I took that
                    flight and arranged for a ship passage to Shanghai.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why is that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Well, I had a dog, for one thing, that I was taking along. I had flown
                    it down to Shanghai, and the air service was not very good between Hong Kong and
                    Shanghai. There was a good passenger service, two British lines operating. They
                    were still operating when I booked, which was at the end of November of '41. I
                    boarded the ship—I think it was the 29th of November, and we duly arrived in
                    Shanghai on the second of December. That was just a week before the blow-up. But
                    unfortunately, a colleague of mine assigned in Shanghai at the time was also in
                    Hong Kong on a little leave, and he took the other ship that was run by the
                    other line. The other line ship got partway up to Shanghai and was ordered by
                    the British naval authorities to turn around and go back. Mine was also to be
                    ordered that way, but the message never arrived, somehow, so our ship went on
                    in.</p>
                <p>We were able to disembark there; I was. I think the first question I had posed to
                    me when I went to the consulate was, “Where is Ingdoll (phonetic)?” Well,
                    unfortunately, Ingdoll had been dumped back into Hong Kong and, tragic as it
                    was, he was killed in a fall in the interned quarters during the internment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he was interned, as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: He was interned there, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were going to Shanghai on an assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Yes, I was reassigned there. I was to take over the job that Edmund
                    Club had been operating, which was the head of the land office, so called, which
                    took care of our properties there, the properties of Americans, took care of
                    protection of Americans, and that sort of thing. I was to take over control of
                    that job, which I had served in that office when I went there in '34. Here I was
                    going back to be in charge of it this time. I was the assistant there on the
                    first assignment. But, of course, we barely managed to get into the office
                    before the war came.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were interned—I don't think you elaborated on
                        that the last time. Exactly what did the Japanese do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: We were, fortunately, given over to the control of the Japanese
                    consulate general there. We didn't see much of them. We worked through the Swiss
                    consulate, which was looking after American affairs. But in general, we were of
                    no complaint. We were well treated by the Japanese, with the assistance of the
                    Swiss. We were first interned in a hotel just across the road from the consulate
                    general in Shanghai, but after about six weeks, they sent us out to an even more
                    comfortable assignment. [Chuckles] Over at the end of the settlement, the other
                    end of the settlement, where we had a comfortable six, seven months before they
                    made the arrangements for the return of all of us to the States in an exchange
                    arranged with the Japanese to take place in Louren�o Marques, in Portuguese East
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>We were not able to do anything. We were able to take walks, we were able to go
                    out occasionally and have a meal in a Chinese restaurant. We were able to live a
                    fairly comfortable life, without harassment, except for three or four of our
                    people who were picked up early on, and a few of our citizens, like—well, I
                    think our assistant naval attach� was interned for a while. He was questioned,
                    of course, by the Japanese, and the editor of an anti-Japanese journal there was
                    picked up and put in jail for several months. He had a rough time. And one or
                    two others. But by and large, the official and civilian communities were well
                    looked after. In fact, the civilians were not even interned for more than a year
                    after the war started.The senior American diplomat at the consulate general in
                    Shanghai nominally was Frank Lockhart, Frank P. Lockhart, an old line officer.
                    But unfortunately, he had come down with—I believe it was hepatitis, and was in
                    a hospital at the time of Pearl Harbor. He remained there virtually throughout
                    the whole incident.</p>
                <p>The number-two was Edwin F. Stanton, an old-time, longtime China language officer
                    and officer who had served around in different parts of China, a very fine
                    officer who looked after things most admirably in the absence of Mr. Lockhart.
                    But there wasn't a great deal to do, really; it was just to wait and hope that
                    we'd get out, which we did. It was about the end of June of '42 that the
                    official contingent was sent out and we joined our colleagues from Japan and
                    north China in Louren�o Marques, and all went back on the Gripsholm.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is interesting, the contrast between the treatment of
                        the diplomatic and civilian population and that treatment of our
                        soldiers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Military had a little tougher treatment. Well, Club, down in Hanoi,
                    had some rough treatment. He had been reassigned to Hanoi not long before. As I
                    said, I took his job in Shanghai. He was a single officer down there, and I
                    think they put him in the hoosegow for a while. But he got out, too, on the swap
                    of diplomats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't waste much time in reassigning you to China.
                        You went back a year later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I got home in August. We got back to New York in August of '42, and
                    after a few days in New York, I went to Washington, and I was given some jobs
                    there for a while, a couple of months, I think, writing reports and that sort of
                    thing. Then I went to see my relatives out in the middle west and was told while
                    I was out there that I was going to be assigned to London. [Chuckles] In fact, I
                    had shipped some of my gear over there. But when I got back to Washington—or
                    even before I was informed that I would be going back to China, because we were
                    opening up a number of posts in the hinterland that we had not had open during
                    the previous assignments. We were going to open up posts in south China, at
                    Kweilin; we were going to open up a post at Chengdu, northwest of Chungking; we
                    were opening a post in Longxi, that's in Ganzu Province; and then also one in
                    Dihua, or Urumqi, in Xinjiang. That was way over near the Soviet border.</p>
                <p>So I was asked my preference at the time, and I chose Chengdu. So I returned to
                    Chungking in January of '43 and was reassigned up to Chengdu, where I spent a
                    few months, and where we were building an airport so that our bombers could
                    attack Japan from there. I had a few months rather on the quiet side in Chengdu.
                    I lived in the missionary community and educational community, basically. I had
                    a room there in a home.</p>
                <p>But then I was informed later that there would be an opening in Sian if I would
                    like to go there, or Longxi, and I wrote back immediately and said I would like
                    to go to Sian, which is north in northwest China, but toward the east side, only
                    about 100 miles from areas occupied by the Japanese and also to the north by the
                    communists.</p>
                <p>So I spent the months from about May of '43 to June of '44 in the Sian area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I was secretary on assignment. I think I was, at the time, a second
                    secretary.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: No, we had no consulate. I was the only officer there, and I did
                    everything from writing dispatches to sending in a few coded messages.
                    [Chuckles]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our interest in Sian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Well, it was to report on happenings in those outlying areas from the
                    embassy. I found, among other things, that I was not welcomed by the commanding
                    general up there, an old line Chinese general. [Chuckles] He never received
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why is that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Well, he didn't like the idea of having a consul or a representative
                    of the embassy in his back yard, apparently, but he did send his chief of staff
                    and things like that. I got to know him. I knew the governor of the province,
                    met him. I knew the mayor of the city and the like. I met all those people and
                    kept in touch with them. But I also spent a lot of time traveling up there. I
                    traveled way over to the east end of the unoccupied areas. I visited with the
                    missionaries, I visited with some Chinese officials, including a military
                    commander, I remember, in the Hunan area, and also the commander down in—well,
                    it's a little south. Then I traveled also to the areas to the south. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were Nationalist officials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Oh, yes. We were still in the Free China-occupied areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Against whom were they focusing their military
                        effort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: In the area north of Sian, they had a line against the communists.
                    Their relationship was poor. They had struggles and conflicts from time to time.
                    So there it was mostly, or partly, against the communists. Again, the commander
                    there had the west bank of the Yellow River over to the east and a little to the
                    north.</p>
                <p>Then over to the east, it was strictly a situation opposing the Japanese, who
                    were to the north, north of the Yellow River, but with some considerable forces,
                    which, by the way, in about April or about May, April to May of '44, launched a
                    campaign, an offensive, through this northern Henan area.</p>

                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Yes. They wanted to link up. There was a railway that ran from there
                    to Hangzhou, the Peking-Hangzhou railway, and they wanted to control all that
                    line. They were successful in doing that. The Chinese were not very effective.
                    They defended as best they could, but there wasn't much to do. It was the usual
                    withdrawal and trying to hang on, basically—period. Yes, I reported on all these
                    affairs there, and I had a pretty hot time getting our people out of Henan and
                    northern Hubei.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the missionaries that you visited—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: They got out that time. We had advised them back in '37 from Hangzhou,
                    to leave at their option, or at least get their families out. Most of them did,
                    but some of them were hanging on, and some even had families there, still, in
                    '44, back in this enclave that was still under the control of the Free Chinese.
                    But this time, when I wrote them and advised them to leave, I think about 95%
                    left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there was a sense, when you were there, that Sian was
                        in danger?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: This is more the area to the east of Sian, Luoyang, and on over to the
                    east as far as the unoccupied area stretched. There were scattered missionaries
                    around here and there, all over the place. I had a list of them, and I wrote
                    them, kept in touch. I called on a bunch of them when I went out there earlier
                    in '44.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did our military assist in any way the—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: We had no military up there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about in terms of supply?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: We couldn't supply them. About all we could do was fly in a few
                    supplies that Stilwell corralled and used down in the southwest, mostly. There
                    was no getting much military equipment into China; it was impossible. There was
                    nothing but the air route or the Burma road, and that proved not to be a
                    success. You couldn't get anything much of it. Spent a lot of effort on it and a
                    lot of time and money, but it didn't prove to be anything of a success.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>So yes, I had an interesting time up in northwest China. I'm glad I chose that
                    assignment. It was very interesting and there were a lot of things going on up
                    there. I had it to myself; there was no one else there. I was reporting
                    regularly to Chungking all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Well, I was recalled, finally. I was recalled, I think, in June, about
                    the beginning of June of '44. I was ordered back to Chungking. Before I went
                    back, I did take a trip up to Longxi and to Qinghai. Those are provinces to the
                    west, pretty far out to the west. I'd never been to those areas. I spent the
                    better part of a month up in those areas. We had a man in Longxi, Harry
                    Stephens, at the time, a consul.</p>
                <p>I went over to Qinghai. Of course, we had nothing there. We didn't even have
                    missionaries there. This was a Muhammadan area of China. They had an interesting
                    leader over there by the name of Ma. He was good enough to invite me to his
                    villa, or palace. He had quite a place. He was a unique person in terms of
                    having defeated the communists who tried to come through his area on a long
                    march. He had chased them out of there. [Chuckles]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he had his own military force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: He had his own military, yes, and it was a pretty good one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In these area in west China, where you were stationed, or
                        where you traveled, did you get any sense of how the ordinary people felt
                        about the three forces that were impinging on them—the Nationalist
                        Government, the communists, and the Japanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I'd say, in general, the population supported the war effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Against the Japanese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Yes, they did. They had a foreboding of what would happen if they came
                    under Japanese control. We had had some inkling of it by way of what happened in
                    Manchuria and what was happening in North China. In fact, hundreds and
                    thousands—I don't know how many—a few million Chinese voluntarily left the
                    occupied areas and made the long march over into the unoccupied areas during
                    wartime, which shows how they felt about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about their attitude toward the communists?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I don't think there was much of a position about that. I don't think
                    it impinged on most of the Chinese, except those who were in the communist areas
                    or who were right near the communist areas. The people, in general, knew very
                    little about the communists and what they were doing. They were trying to spread
                    their message, their propaganda, and I think they had some success with some of
                    the so-called educated class and intelligentsia. They drew some into Yunnan,
                    even. They had some go there. And they did have quite a swing, as I indicated
                    before, with the media and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your knowledge in that particular area, were they any
                        more successful in their fight against the Japanese than were the
                        Nationalist forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: They were part of the Nationalist forces. For instance, the general in
                    Sian, he was part of the Nationalist forces. He'd been sent there by the Central
                    Government to defend—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The communists and Nationalists were fighting each other,
                        as well as each fighting the Japanese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: There was a little. It was only a little skirmishing here and there at
                    the time I was up there. I think the biggest incident was one that happened down
                    in a province in Central China, called Anhui, where the communists were trying
                    to form a new military force, let's say, starting in about '41. They had some
                    little success, apparently, in that. They built up an army of sorts, and
                    eventually came to a clash because the national army, the national military,
                    felt this was a threat to them and their integrity. So there was a clash in
                    which this communist force was driven out, or defeated. That occurred in 1941 or
                    '42.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the suggestion is made, or at least that I understood
                        from your previous comments, was that the media and some intellectuals felt
                        that the communists were fighting the Japanese, or would have fought the
                        Japanese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Well, the truth is, they never did fight the Japanese. I will go on
                    record as saying that. They avoided fighting the Japanese. I think I mentioned
                    that in my previous report. Their motivation at the time was to build up their
                    own forces for the fight that came later. In that, they were pretty eminently
                    successfully. They knew they couldn't fight the Japanese head on, any more than
                    the Nationalists found that they couldn't, after several disastrous fights. It
                    was a matter of trying to hold what you had and retreating when the enemy
                    advanced on you with his superior forces. That's what it amounted to.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>So anyone who says the communists were fighting the Japanese, I would say, “Let's
                    prove it.” I never saw any of it in my time there. They did build themselves up,
                    as evidenced by their fight after the war was over against the Nationalists, the
                    National Government, with very a very big shot of aid from the Soviet Russians,
                    who handed over all the equipment and arms of the army of Japan, which they had
                    succeeded to when they rushed into Manchuria at the end of the war. Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You moved to another troubled spot right after the war,
                        and that was Korea. You were in South Korea when the North Koreans invaded.
                        Isn't that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Let's see. I was in England for a while first. I was back in the State
                    Department. I went home in the fall of '44, and I joined the State Department at
                    the beginning of '45. I urged help to the Nationalists out there. The war was
                    now coming to an end, and it did eventually come to an end, as we know, in
                    August of '45, with the surrender of the Japanese. But it took the atomic bomb,
                    a couple of them, to bring the Japanese around to their senses on it.</p>
                <p>But meantime, the situation in China had got much worse. I left in '44. The war
                    was over in '45. Wedemeyer assisted the Chinese, a great job on his part, to get
                    back into the occupied areas with the Chinese Army, and they did successfully
                    occupy most of those which were not already occupied by the communists. Then the
                    Nationalists made the big mistake of trying to put their premier, their main
                    forces, up into Manchuria, which was a long run of about 1,500 miles against the
                    prepared and well-armed communist forces, communists armed by the Soviets, with
                    the Japanese equipment which they had taken at the end of the war. And there it
                    was too much. The Nationalists were defeated, and that put another black mark
                    against their record in Washington and so forth. We had already pretty much
                    stopped any aid to them. We had helped them to get back into the old occupied
                    area, and that was about it.</p>
                <p>We then decided the only thing to do was to try to work out an armistice or a
                    settlement or agreement between the government and the communists on the running
                    of China, and it was then at the end of '45 that George Marshall was sent out on
                    that ill-fated mission. I had said back then it would not succeed. I was against
                    it, I think as I mentioned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I was chief of the China Division. My superior was John Carter
                    Vincent, who believed in it, and helped set up the Marshall mission. And that
                    was that.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>So our aid to the national government stopped. In its place, we sent Marshall to
                    try to come to a settlement with the communists, bring them into the government,
                    probably with the idea of coalition, but even that failed. The communists were
                    not interested at that time, and the national government didn't see much in it,
                    either, from their point of view. So it was a failure, and Marshall pulled out
                    of there in the early months of '47, shouting, “A plague on both your houses!”
                    [Laughter] That was that.</p>
                <p>Then from then on, it was a fight. The fight went on between the communists and
                    the national government, with the government steadily on the losing side. They
                    would win a battle now and then, and generally they continued to lose and to
                    fall back, with the communists taking, I believe, Nanking in '48, the capital,
                    and with Shanghai falling about the middle of '49, I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I was in Korea. I went there in '48.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were no longer involved with China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I was not involved in it. I had left the State Department in the fall
                    of '46, and I was out. I was not simpatico with the policy, and they had no job
                    for me there, so they sent me to London, where I pursued Far Eastern affairs
                    pretty far removed from what was going on in China. It did not impinge much on
                    the job in London at the time. The British were much more concerned about India
                    and Southeast Asia at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your assignment to Korea was in what capacity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Let's see. Actually, in the spring of '48, I was reassigned first to
                    be deputy to Sebald, a political advisor in Japan. I wasn't too keen about that
                    job, but I went. Like a good soldier, a Foreign Service officer should. I
                    arrived there in June, early June, of '48, and joined Sebald and his political
                    advisors' group. I was helping out as the number-two there. Bill was an old
                    line. He was a Japanese language officer, a Navy man. Not a Foreign Service
                    officer, but a Navy man who had studied Japanese and who had even practiced law
                    in Japan. He had a wide knowledge of the Japanese and of Japan, and did a fine
                    job there as the political advisor to MacArthur. I think MacArthur listened to
                    him pretty carefully, which was all to the good.</p>
                <p>I was not even settled in my job when one day we got a telegram saying Drumright
                    would be needed in Korea, where a Korean Government was coming into power. There
                    had been an election, a pretty free one, and Syngman Rhee was being elected
                    president and would be taking power in August of '48.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>So we needed to establish an office, a mission, there, and get going, because we
                    would have a lot to do. Our part of Korea had been a military governorship since
                    '45. We had pretty much run the south of Korea with some help from some
                    top-flight Koreans. But now they were going to be taking over and assuming the
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: My position was deputy. I really had no definite position. I really
                    took the place of Joe Jacobs there for a month or two, Joseph E. Jacobs, who
                    later was ambassador to Czechoslovakia. Jacobs had been a China language
                    officer, like myself, many years before. But he hadn't served much in the
                    Orient—15 or 20 years. But he had been sent out for that job and had served
                    there, I guess, for a couple of years, and had done an excellent job with the
                    military. There the main show was the military at that time. We were really in
                    an advisory position, much like Sebald was with MacArthur in Japan. But we had a
                    different title for it.</p>
                <p>Very shortly after I arrived, Jacobs left and the consulate more or less closed
                    down. We had a little consulate there, with the thought that we would open a
                    mission, with the idea that we would, and we did. I started it up, looking for
                    buildings and things, and John J. Muchow came on as special representative of
                    the President, I think in probably about the end of September, and assumed that
                    special representative job, which went on for a number of months before we had
                    the official recognition with Muchow becoming ambassador. And with that, the
                    establishment of an embassy, a formal embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point, you were political advisor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I was assigned as counselor of embassy, or later we started calling it
                    deputy chief of mission. Yes. We established a large mission there. We had quite
                    a few people there before things were stopped by the invasion. We had a 500-man
                    military advisory group; we had 100 or more people in our economic AID mission;
                    and we had 30 or 40 people in our embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much contact did you have with the Koreans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Oh, we had close contact with the Koreans. For one thing, we had got
                    to know Rhee even before he became president, and we got to know some of the
                    other chief people around there, the man who became prime minister, some of the
                    chief legislators, and the like. Yes, we knew them.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impressions of Syngman Rhee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Rhee was an old-line revolutionary. He, as a young man, came out of
                    North Korea, what we know as North Korea now, and started agitating against the
                    Japanese occupation. His agitation eventually became so open that he was exiled.
                    After that, he made some headway, too, by the way. It wasn't hard to stir up
                    Koreans, who had hated the Japanese and their occupation, and wanted to be free.
                    He made enough headway to come to the Japanese attention and to be thrown out.
                    For a while, I think he spent a few months or maybe a year or two in the
                    Shanghai area of China, after which he went to the States, and he continued his
                    revolutionary work, either from Hawaii or the mainland here, I think mainly in
                    Washington, where the political power lay. Always working for a free Korea, but
                    with very little chance of any success until the war came. After that, I think
                    his hopes were immensely lifted and were realized, of course, on the defeat of
                    Japan and the complete withdrawal of Japanese people and interests from
                    Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had a reputation of being rather autocratic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Well . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And self-seeking.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I think we must remember that Korea, from its inception, was a country
                    of dynasties, ruled by a powerful king. That obtained right up until the
                    Japanese took it over. If anything, they ruled the Korean people with even more
                    rigor than their own rulers had in the past.</p>
                <p>As for Syngman Rhee, he was an educated man. He knew about democracy in America,
                    he had studied it there, and he was elected basically under democratic regimen
                    in Korea. He took over as president to establish an entirely new government. It
                    perhaps took a little autocracy at the time to get something going in a country
                    that had never known democracy, that had little in the way of education, people
                    who had been educated. There were a few, but not many, and most of those had
                    been educated in Japan, if they were educated. So we had to start from base
                    one.</p>
                <p>As I look back on it, I wouldn't say he was terribly autocratic in those early
                    years when I was there. He managed to establish a government. I think it was a
                    government that was operating during the years I was there. He, I think,
                    expected more help from us than he got.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Help in what way? Economic assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: We had a fairly good economic program. I think it was beginning to
                    take off in the about two years that we had to do something with it. We had a
                    program of, let's say, about $100 million a year. We helped the Koreans and
                    developed their economy, developed their banking system, their economic system,
                    as such, even. They had some good men in the Ministry of Finance and in the bank
                    and so forth, who had some ideas of Western economics and so on. There was
                    progress being made. There was very little private economy. A good part of the
                    economy was operated by the government. They had taken over the railroads and
                    some of the big businesses at first, and that sort of thing that they had
                    incorporated from Japanese ownership and the like. So things were moving along,
                    as I think we felt in the embassy, not too badly. There was hope that something
                    could come out of this.</p>
                <p>As I said, Rhee, I think, was disappointed, particularly in terms of our military
                    help. We left some stuff when we removed our forces from Korea. Our two last
                    divisions left as of June 30, 1949. That was about a year after Rhee took over,
                    and a little over a year after we arrived there. We had opposed it. We said it
                    was premature. By “we,” I mean in our embassy, the ambassador and the rest of
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean this equipment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: We opposed the withdrawal of our military forces. We said it would
                    make a dangerous situation much more dangerous, and we also advocated a much
                    strong rearmament of the South Korean Defense Forces than the arms they had,
                    which were not much. The position in Washington was that we would help them
                    establish a little more than what we would call a constabulary, perhaps a
                    combination of police and military, to take care of the law and order in Korea,
                    and provide defense against the North if needed.</p>
                <p>Evidently, of course, there was a strong feeling in the United States that the
                    war was over, we had done our bit, and other than keeping forces in a few places
                    like Japan and Germany, we would pull out. Unfortunately, Korea was not added to
                    that list. We pulled out. The proof of the pudding there was that within about a
                    year, we had a big invasion. All right. Well, anyway, we pulled the forces out,
                    leaving very little to oppose a North Korean invasion, and we did not supply the
                    South Koreans with the arms that would be required to put up a strong defense
                    against a very strong North Korean military. That was not done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If the embassy foresaw a threat from the North, or at
                        least felt that the South Koreans should have been better armed and we
                        should have remained there, I assume that this information was forwarded to
                        Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Oh, sure. Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then how do you explain the reverse, when Korea was taken
                        off of the “danger list,” so to speak?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Well, as I indicated a moment ago, we felt—back in Washington,
                    anyway—that the war was over, and we had provided adequate arms and advisory
                    force to do what was necessary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we did have an advisory force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: We had a 500-man advisory force, which was helping the South Koreans
                    organized and train their forces, which amounted to about 100,000. Now, the
                    North Koreans had several hundred thousand men under big arms, tanks, artillery,
                    heavy artillery, everything, what have you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the United States still had 100,000 troops?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: We had two divisions when we pulled out our final forces and left only
                    an advisory group of 500 men.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I see. The 500 men were after.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Yes. That's all we had. So this was virtually an invitation to the
                    North Koreans and their backers, the Soviets and the Chinese communists, to come
                    in. Added to that was the fact that Dean Acheson, in an address in January of
                    1950, placed Korea outside the limits of our strategic interests. So I think,
                    all in all, you can say that because we had drawn a line that did not include
                    South Korea within our strategic limits, we had pursued the policy we had in the
                    military, which was to lightly arm a force of about 100,000, and withdraw our
                    own forces. That was the policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume, then, that the State Department operated
                        contrary to the advice of the ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: The State Department obviously was operating—and perhaps the President
                    and his staff were operating in a position that was very contrary to what we had
                    recommended from the embassy in Korea. The upshot of all that was the invasion.
                    There I would have to say we were constantly worried about it, and the South
                    Koreans, especially their military, were even more worried about it. They kept
                    telling us and saying that the North Koreans were getting on the move and were
                    preparing for something up there, but I have to admit that we didn't take it
                    quite as seriously as we perhaps should have in that light. But I'm afraid that
                    in light of the situation in Washington, we would have merely reported it was an
                    extraordinarily dangerous situation and we should take some action to curb it,
                    but we didn't.</p>
                <p>That is, up until the invasion, whereupon President Truman took charge and did
                    quite a job of backing up. But by then, of course, we had a big invasion and the
                    South Koreans were doing what they could, the best they could. They fought
                    valiantly, but they had to go back. We had to all go back.</p>
                <p>We finally ended up in a little Pusan perimeter, so called, about 60 miles long
                    and 40 miles wide, over to the coast, where we managed to defend, largely
                    because by that time we had got some fairly strong forces in, including part of
                    them from Japan and some from the States. We had a better inkling of what was
                    going on and what we had to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the ambassador remain throughout this period, or was
                        there a change?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: No, Ambassador Muchow remained. He remained basically with the Korean
                    Government in Pusan and tried to hold the hand of President Rhee.</p>
                <p>I never did quite end up my little spiel about Rhee and his arrogance or
                    whatever. [Chuckles] He was very disappointed with us because of our position.
                    You can understand that position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: And I recall going south to touch base with him after we had to
                    withdraw from Seoul, the capital, and go south. I was told by Muchow to make
                    contact with him. He had left without even notifying us, which I didn't care
                    much for, or anybody. But I did get in touch with him in a town down the line
                    about 100 miles below Seoul. We had a long conversation one afternoon there,
                    after I arrived, and he was extraordinarily bitter and critical of the US. I
                    couldn't say very much. I felt considerable sympathy for him, and I wasn't able
                    to give him any assurance at that time that we would be doing anything to help,
                    whether he would be kicked out altogether. Certainly if we didn't help, he'd
                    have been out of there altogether in about two weeks. So it was a bigger
                    experience which I subsequently reported to Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>But overnight, that night I went home. I was very tired. We hadn't had any sleep
                    for a couple of nights. I went home, went to bed at a place we were staying
                    there in this town, and during the night, a couple of my subordinates were
                    listening to a portable radio I had brought out, and they got the message that
                    Truman had ordered US forces into Korea to assist the South Koreans. Well, I was
                    given this message early the following morning, and I immediately trotted over
                    to see Rhee, to give him the good news. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what was his reaction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: His reaction was, “Well, I haven't seen anything yet, planes or
                    anything.” [Laughter] But very little later, we had planes flying over that
                    country, and we began to take steps back in Washington to put the machine into
                    action, with the result that the offensive was well after MacArthur made his
                    play at the Inchon landing. Things reversed rapidly. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't there when the Chinese crossed the border,
                        though?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Yes, I was in Seoul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, you were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Yes, I was up there. We had a big to-do with Washington over whether
                    we should cross the 38th parallel. After our forces had defeated the Chinese and
                    North Koreans and driven them out of South Korea, the question then was: do we
                    go north? Do we pursue these people? And there was a considerable opinion back
                    in Washington, apparently, that we should let up on it there and stay at the
                    parallel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the embassy feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Our feeling was to go on and drive them all out of Korea and unify the
                    country. That's what we had gone there for in the first place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the question was, should the forces—oh, I see.
                        Crossing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: They would cross the 38th parallel and go on into North Korea, which
                    they did. Finally, Washington gave its assent after some reluctance, and
                    MacArthur divided his forces then. He was in favor of it, of course. He wanted
                    to hit them hard and drive them out and bomb the Chinese forces.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the Chinese hadn't entered yet, had they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: No, they hadn't entered then. They entered about a month later.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I mean after the Chinese entered, he wanted to really take them out.
                    No, for a month or so, or five or six weeks, we went on north with very little
                    resistance from the North Koreans, who were withdrawing as best they could into
                    Manchuria. They were not putting up any substantial resistance anywhere, so we
                    had virtually occupied the whole of North Korea, most of it, by the time the
                    Chinese came in.</p>
                <p>I understand we had been warned of that possibility. I believe Zhou En-lai had
                    told the British or somebody, “Would you kindly inform the Americans that if
                    they keep this up, we're coming in.” [Laughter] But nobody took it very
                    seriously. The Chinese themselves had been in power only about a year when this
                    took place, and they really hadn't got their feet much on the ground when they
                    went in. I assume they must have been given some big assurances by the Soviets
                    to help them out in going in there. In that invasion, they used a lot of the
                    old-line Chinese Nationalist troops, put them up as cannon fodder. Yes. Plenty
                    of them got killed.</p>
                <p>I was there. I was for that, and I was there when General Walker, the first
                    commander, was killed in a jeep accident, unfortunately, and then was replaced
                    by General [Matthew] Ridgway, both of them fine generals. They kept up the
                    fight. But in the face of this avalanche of Chinese forces, the military,
                    MacArthur and Ridgway, decided the best policy was to withdraw a reasonable
                    distance, regroup, and then resume the offensive against the Chinese. Well, it
                    would be mostly Chinese. The North Koreans had been pretty badly broken. So
                    that's what happened.</p>
                <p>Starting about March of '50, our forces went over to the attack and gradually
                    drove the Chinese out. They could not support their forces that far down in
                    Korea. Obviously they could not do it, especially with our complete command of
                    the air and our bombing all lines of communications and that sort of thing. So
                    we moved back rapidly and reoccupied Seoul, I think by about the first of April.
                    I went up there, had a look around, and came back.</p>
                <p>Then a short time later, I was reassigned to Washington. So I left Korea in the
                    latter part of April, went to Japan and got a ride on a plane with John Foster
                    Dulles, who was then a special advisor to the State Department. He'd been out on
                    some Japanese negotiations at that time. Went back to Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>I think the attitude there, as I saw it, was, “Well, let's try to wrap this thing
                    up and get it over with.” And there was an armistice. The Russians came around
                    about July of '51, and proposed an armistice and discussions. Of course, the US
                    was tired of it, too. But I was one of those who said we should go on and clean
                    them out of Korea, and then we can talk if they want to discuss this situation.
                    The Russians had come around obviously because they were being defeated. The
                    Russians were not coming in. We had the atomic bomb, and they didn't quite have
                    one. So they weren't going to stick their noses—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I had no real position. I guess you could call kind of a floating
                    advisor around there for a while. My advice was to carry on with the war and
                    eliminate all resistance in all parts of Korea. Then we could discuss problems
                    with the Chinese and Soviets if they wanted to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this was not the prevailing sentiment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: That was not the sentiment that was adopted. The position was taken
                    that we would go to the armistice, and that armistice is still in being, still
                    right there now today. They still meet occasionally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's an interesting place for tourists to visit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I was there a couple of years ago, the first time I had ever visited
                    Panmunjom, and that's where they still meet and talk. It's all empty rhetoric,
                    nothing to it.</p>
                <p>So for my pains, I was moved out of Far East, or the Orient, and assigned to
                    India. Well, India's a little bit of the Orient, but didn't figure much in what
                    was going on over there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the prime minister at the time you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Where?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In India, when you got to Delhi.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: [Jawaharlal] Nehru. I had the honor to meet Nehru a couple of three
                    times, had a chat or two with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I was political counselor of the embassy when I went to Delhi. The
                    ambassador was—oh, my God, our most prominent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chester Bowles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: No, he came later. Our old-line great man in Washington for years, Loy
                    Henderson. Loy asked for me. They were planning to send another man there, but
                    he heard that I was available, and so he asked for me. They sent the other man
                    as counselor down in Ceylon at that time.</p>
                <p>So I went out there not really caring much to go, and I found it a difficult, but
                    interesting, assignment for a couple of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why difficult?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Because India is difficult to a newcomer. I mean, it's a very
                    difficult country to get to know much of anything about. It was terribly
                    difficult, all these different peoples, different languages, long-time history,
                    occupation by the British, and then the takeover in '48 by the Indian
                    administration from the British. That had been only three years before I went
                    there. They were still feeling their way coming in. Difficulties with Pakistan.
                    An inherent dislike on the part of Nehru and some of his cohorts for the United
                    States. They just didn't have much use for us. They were really pro-British, if
                    anything, even after all the years of subordination. I guess they felt the
                    British were more sympathetic or something in those times. But we never took a
                    front seat into the problems of India, except to develop a pretty good AID
                    program, but one that was difficult to get off with in a huge country like that
                    with so many diversities and problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: India is almost traditionally hostile to the United
                        States, even today. How do you explain that, apart from their British
                        tradition? It must be more than that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: No, I think they had some kind of suspicion of us. For one thing, of
                    course, we were fairly friendly to Pakistan all this time, and they really
                    wanted Pakistan to be a part of their unity, their kingdom, their country. That,
                    of course, was spoiled by the British, along with some of the Pakistani
                    leadership. So they had a feeling all along that we were, if anything, more
                    sympathetic to the Pakistanis than to India. Other than that, I think it was
                    just some inherent suspicion of the United States, not very much knowledge of us
                    and what made us tick, and so forth, whereas they did have a pretty good
                    knowledge of the British and what they were doing and what they were up to and
                    so forth.</p>
                <p>Anyway, there was that. I could feel it. I could sense it in Nehru and in the
                    foreign office and the other people you met around in the government and the
                    like, most of them. It was a feeling that I couldn't divest myself of until I
                    went over to Bombay, where I felt there was an entirely different attitude and
                    feeling about the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Bombay, you had what job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I went as consul general there by my own request. I never got along
                    too well with Chester Bowles. Chet wanted to run everything his own way, and he
                    brought his own people out. He listened to them, and he didn't listen to many
                    other people. He was very pro-Indian, despite the rebuffs he got from Nehru and
                    all. He was bent on helping India, and he did his best to help them. I'll say
                    that for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say that relations between the two countries
                        improved or just didn't change at all, even though he had a more favorable
                        attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I didn't see much change in my time there, which was most of the
                    period when Chester Bowles was there. But I was not in Delhi. From what I could
                    learn or sense, I didn't see any particular difference. And even today, the
                    Indians are more likely to cotton up to the British, or even the Soviets, and
                    they would like to cotton up to the Chinese, although the Chinese have given
                    them two or three pretty hard rebuffs. So we're off in the distance from
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you say that Bombay was different?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Well, Bombay is on the west coast. It's a long-time trading center
                    with the West, with Europe, and even with America. You had a different type of
                    Indian people there. They had two or three different groups there, which seemed
                    to be much more attuned to the West. You had a small group of people called the
                    Parsis, who were traders and businessmen and some politicians, who seemed to
                    have a much wider grasp of world affairs than the average Indian, even the civil
                    servant. So you go down there and you get into this commercial and trading
                    community, and you sense a different feeling entirely. I met a good many of
                    those people. They were quite friendly, and I think they wanted good relations
                    with the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was only in Bombay very briefly. It's the New York City
                        of India. I mean, it's a big city with commercial interests.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: It's the prevailing economic center with its location on the west
                    coast. Calcutta is a larger city, but it's a miserable place, just doesn't seem
                    to get out of the dumps, you know. Never has.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From India, you went back to State. In what capacity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I went as deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau—I guess it was
                    called East Asian Affairs by that time. Far East or East Asian, yes. I was there
                    about a year. The main problems related to China and Indochina. Those were the
                    main items on the agenda. On China, the Chinese communists were moving in a
                    fairly aggressive way toward Taiwan, I thought, anyhow, and they absorbed a
                    small set of islands given up by the Chinese Nationalists, and perhaps partly at
                    our suggestion. Then the question of the offshore islands. Not long after I
                    arrived there, within six months, we had the so-called offshore island incident,
                    wherein the Chinese communists attacked those islands near the coast. But it was
                    largely artillery bombardment that went on for days and days that could have
                    assumed a serious proportion.The Chinese communists were bombarding those
                    offshore islands and threatening Taiwan, with which we had recognition and with
                    which we had agreements.</p>
                <p>The Chinese Nationalists held their ground very well in that offshore affair, and
                    managed rather heroically to resupply it under adverse conditions. But I think
                    the main factor there in the long run was the attitude adopted by President
                    Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles, which was to support the Chinese
                    Government there, the national government, in its position about those islands,
                    and to even make some gestures not of a very friendly nature toward the
                    mainland. I think that was adequate to scare off the communists if they had
                    ideas of expanding on their shelling and the like. And perhaps also the Soviets
                    may have advised them to lay off a bit.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Anyhow, that was over. But I had supported that position strongly myself, as a
                    deputy assistant, and I was in charge, I believe, during—well, I was the
                    ambassador in Taiwan when that occurred. But before that in Washington, I had
                    asserted the position of the Chinese national government as much as I could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a political controversy in Washington and
                        throughout the country roughly at that time, over this issue of having
                        “lost” China to the communists.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: That had been going on almost since '46. Well, not '46. Let's
                    say—well, not the loss, exactly, but the impending loss. Well, it started,
                    really, in '45 when we withdrew our support, basically, of the mainland Chinese
                    against the communists. It was engendered by the Marshall mission and it went
                    forward during the following years—the loss of Manchuria and the communist
                    advance in China after the Marshall mission, and went on forward with the
                    military affairs taking first place. There were desultory negotiations which we
                    attempted some part, but they were not successful. It ended up with the
                    communists obtaining total control by the latter part of '49.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in effect, the charge, really, if you boil it down,
                        was that State Department policy was such—or policy and personnel were such
                        that they resulted in the “loss” of China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Well, you can look at—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were involved and you knew these people. What is your
                        feeling about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Well, we can look at the White Paper for a historical record, a
                    considerable bit of it in that, about what was happening and what the policy was
                    toward China and so on. My position was one of support of the government, which
                    had been our ally in the war and which had continued the war against Japan under
                    the most adverse of circumstances, which had fought through and which had
                    reoccupied the eastern occupied areas of China, except for Manchuria. And I
                    thought that we had best go ahead. Now, that would require considerable aid and
                    assistance, and perhaps even military assistance, yes. But I felt it was the
                    best position that we could take. This was before the communists had assumed the
                    strength that they assumed later on after they obtained Manchuria and then took
                    over North China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Knowing all of this and knowing how you felt, do you feel
                        that had the United States taken a more aggressive position and a less
                        equivocal position, that the communists would not have taken over
                        China?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: I felt there was a good possibility that the situation could have been
                    turned around from the start in '45. I think Wedemeyer had made a very good
                    start in '45 and '46, before he was withdrawn. And had we continued on that line
                    and then resumed some concrete military assistance, and showed our support of
                    the government and our non-support of the communists in a clear way, I think,
                    yes, there was a good possibility that the thing could have been turned around.
                    That was my feeling, and I still have that feeling now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But part of that criticism evolved down to the
                        personalities. Would you subscribe to the charge that was made by some at
                        that time that there were people in the State Department who, for
                        ideological reasons, supported—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Well, there was Alger Hiss, of course, but I wouldn't go so far as to
                    say that John Carter Vincent or Dean Acheson, who was the Secretary at the time,
                    were ideological partners of the communists. No. I think perhaps their position
                    was that it was hopeless to continue helping the national government of China
                    and that we had, therefore, better turn to the Chinese communists and try to
                    work out a deal with them. That's what it really boiled down to. Whether they
                    thought highly of communism is something else. I don't know. I hope not, because
                    from what we can see today . . . [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're running out of tape, so let's jump to your position
                        as ambassador in Taipei. How would you evaluate this? This was in the Chiang
                        Kai-shek era. How would you evaluate his leadership in Taipei in the period
                        that you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Well, I think it was excellent. He was leading a leadership that has
                    turned Taiwan around entirely. I think he played a good part in the
                    stabilization of the country after the defeat on the mainland and the
                    reorganization that had to take place on Taiwan. He worked skillfully to
                    continue the American relationship and hadn't given up completely, even at the
                    beginning of 1950, when Dean Acheson had excluded Taiwan from that area which is
                    of real strategic interest to the United States. I think there's no doubt that
                    at that time, the US policy was to pull out of Taiwan entirely and hand it over
                    to the Chinese communists, after which we'd have to deal with them as best we
                    could, although we'd had some pretty sharp rebuffs already from the communists.
                    They had very little use for us and were tied in with Soviet Russia. That was
                    about the way it stood.</p>
                <p>So Chiang Kai-shek was holding the line as best he could there, and trying to
                    organize the government and the economy, but it was a hold-on operation entirely
                    until the Korean War started, after which we had a realization that Taiwan,
                    although damaged goods, was pretty vital to our interests, and we'd better step
                    in and help them, something that we had not done basically since 1945 in China,
                    at least late or at the beginning of '46.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>So we stepped in and immediately sent an ambassador there, Carl Rankin, who did
                    an excellent job, and started up a military and economic aid program, from which
                    we have come forward to this day. I was Carl Rankin's successor in the early
                    days of '58. Things were headed, I think, in the right direction.</p>
                <p>Chiang was in control. He ran a pretty tight government. Lots of people objected
                    to that, thinking that he should loosen up and set up a democratic form of
                    government. Well, he couldn't quite do that with this big enemy over there on
                    his flank, shouting from one day to another they were going to reunify with
                    Taiwan, and so forth and so on. He had to be pretty careful, and he was that. He
                    kept the communists out. There was no infiltration to speak of at all during
                    those years.</p>
                <p>By the time I came on, I think things were really sighted in a forward direction,
                    both with the improvement of his military and rearming of it, and the economy,
                    in particular, was beginning to move forward. This situation went forward during
                    my administration, or my time there. I had a close liaison with Chiang Kai-shek
                    and his administration, and we worked closely.</p>
                <p>By the way, at the end of '54, after I left the Department, there was a defense
                    treaty negotiated. It was quite an achievement. The Chinese there felt very much
                    better after that. All right. Then again, after the settlement of the offshore
                    incident, that is to say, the quieting-down of it, the Chinese on Taiwan again
                    felt much more reassured about things.</p>
                <p>So from that time on, they began to take off, and the tremendous economic
                    development that has taken place to this day, which makes them about the 13th
                    country in the world in terms of their foreign trade, if you can believe that, a
                    country of 20 million people, and one which is fifth or sixth in its trade with
                    the United States of America. So on and so on. You can recite all these.</p>
                <p>Now, Chiang, who was pretty tight, a little arbitrary, eventually was succeeded
                    by his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, who adopted a more liberal course. It took some
                    time, but he did. Toward the end of his administration, which was—he died last
                    year, wasn't it?—he had loosened up very materially. He felt assured enough to
                    develop a much more liberal administration there, and yet keep the economy on
                    its course, and appoint a Taiwanese to be vice president, a very wise choice, as
                    it turns out, apparently. Lee Teng-hui has now become the president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a question I wanted to ask you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: He's done an excellent job. He's doing very, very well, indeed, and
                    they may be in better shape yet. They're loosening up, they're becoming more
                    democratic all the time, loosening up, more liberal in their political policies,
                    and they have even pretty well stopped this so-called independence movement in
                    its steps, it seems.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the question. When you were there and Chiang was in
                        charge, one of the issues that kept being raised was the imposition of the
                        mainlanders onto the Taiwanese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: In 1948, there was even a rebellion. At that time, of course, Chiang
                    had sent a governor over there to represent him, but he had no time at all then
                    to do much about Taiwan. It was offshore there somewhere. This government he
                    sent over there was a lamentable failure, and there was a revolution, a small
                    one. There was some fighting. They had to put down this thing. I think there was
                    some loss of life and so forth.</p>
                <p>So that indicates that before Chiang got there in late '49, his government, that
                    the Taiwanese were very unhappy. I think there had been some unhappiness ever
                    since, basically. They feel somewhat separate from the mainland Chinese. But in
                    general, they were satisfied to go along because they were not being absorbed by
                    the communists. They did not want them. And they were gradually getting a little
                    freer status as time went on, and certainly their economy was tremendously
                    developing. Most of that development, by the way, went to the Taiwanese people,
                    not to the mainlanders. They're the poor people of Taiwan today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who are, the mainlanders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DRUMRIGHT: Yes, the mainlanders. Most of them are in the military or in the
                    government; they weren't in business and taking over these big industries that
                    developed and so forth. It was the Taiwan people who did it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting. At the time that you were there, the
                        suggestion was that there was a two-class society, the mainlanders and the
                        Taiwanese. [Doorbell interruption]</hi>
