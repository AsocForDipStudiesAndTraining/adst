                <p>Q: Today is the 28th of April, 1999. This is an interview with Gilbert R.
                    Callaway. This is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies
                    and Training. I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. Let's begin at the beginning. Can you
                    tell me when and where you were born, and something about your family?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I was born in Memphis, Tennessee in July, 1938. My father was working
                    at a bank in Memphis at the time. He also worked on a couple of occasions for an
                    uncle who lived in Mississippi so before I really had too many early memories we
                    had lived both in Memphis, Tennessee and in a small little town south of
                    Clarksdale, Mississippi by the name of Mattson. By small I mean really small,
                    two [cotton] gins and one mile in between and not much else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this in the center of the state?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Mattson is near Clarksdale which is in the Delta. Some of the earliest
                    memories are of going to school in literally a one room schoolhouse in which
                    each row was a grade. The teacher would teach the first grade and go to the
                    second row which was the second grade. When I was in second grade we moved to
                    Forrest City, Arkansas and my father opened his own business as a public
                    accountant. There I lived until I went away to college.</p>
                <p>Q: What do you recall about the Delta? Do you have many impressions of the
                    Delta?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: My impressions are mixed because I still to this day have relatives
                    living there. My father's sister lived in this small town. She was married there
                    and lived there until she died. A little further over in what is called the hill
                    country of Mississippi, I had another aunt and uncle, and my father's parents,
                    in a little town by the name of Oakland. It was bigger than Mattson by about 450
                    people, meaning there were about 500 people. There were a lot of trips there
                    during childhood and growing up. Even now I go back to see some cousins.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>There's been a lot of research done on civil rights, going from a terribly
                    segregated and accepted kind of atmosphere and situation - you just didn't think
                    about it growing up in it - to having seen a good deal of legal process with
                    still a lot of social retardation in that area. That is my observation to this
                    day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As little kids was there much intermixture at the little
                        kilevel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: You mean between blacks and whites?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: We played with them. As I say it was a small town. You did not go to
                    school with them because the schools were segregated. In the fields or after
                    school you would play games and so on. There was certainly no social intermixing
                    but I knew some and would ride on mules with them and run around the fields.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your mother's background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: As she likes to tell me - my mother is still living - my mother's
                    family is probably where I got my wandering itchy feet. Her father had come from
                    the southern part of Illinois from a little town named Peoria in the Springfield
                    area. He had done a bit of everything. He was a watch repair man. He drove a
                    streetcar. He homesteaded in South Dakota in a sod hut out there. He went to St.
                    Louis and drove a street car because he thought it would be fun to be there
                    during the World's Fair. He went to Oklahoma when they opened up some of the oil
                    fields there and worked as a roustabout there in the fields. He just kept
                    moving.</p>
                <p>He finally settled down when my mother and her younger sister were in their late
                    teens, in Arkansas in another little bitty hole in the wall by the name of Heth,
                    Arkansas. It is also in the Delta in the eastern part of the state. He took up
                    farming and stayed there in that area until he died. This is how my father from
                    Mississippi and my mother from Arkansas were introduced by people from Memphis
                    and so the tri-states came together to my benefit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old were you when you moved to Heth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: To Forrest City. Heth was where my grandparents lived. I was in the
                    second grade so I must have been about seven or eight years old.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there quite a while?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes. I finished high school in Forrest City. Forrest City is a town of
                    about 15,000. It is about 45 miles west of Memphis and about 90 miles east of
                    Little Rock on the road in-between. It's an interesting town. It is named after
                    Nathan Bedford Forrest because after the war he went into the railroad business
                    and extended the railroad from Memphis over to Forrest City. It was first named
                    Forrest Camp.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like growing up there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: As I say it was a town of about 15,000. It was an agricultural service
                    community. This is in the Delta. The people around there are mostly farmers,
                    some large and some small, and the town served them. My father kept books and
                    did income tax returns; that was the kind of accounting that he did for banks
                    and businesses in the area. It had a segregated high school. The black high
                    school was called Lincoln High and the other one was called Forrest City
                    High.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Forrest was a slave dealer in his early years before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Forrest was one of the founders of the Ku Klux Klan. As I say, looking
                    back on it, you see many of the faults and the social conflicts and the
                    injustices that were going on. We were not a wealthy family though we were not a
                    poor family. We were very much medium class. When we first moved there we
                    started out by living in what was known as a garage apartment in which your
                    garage is downstairs and about two rooms are above that. Slowly, as my father
                    built his business up, he built a larger brick house and we moved into that. It
                    was a very pleasant childhood. I was happy in school work and happy in the
                    friends I had there.</p>
                <p>You look back on it and say there are many disadvantages of living in a small
                    town. My sister, having moved away, has returned to that small town. Jumping
                    ahead and philosophizing a bit, her first husband died when he dropped dead of a
                    heart attack at the age of 39 and she was left with two pretty small children.
                    She said a small town can be very interfering and very intrusive into your
                    private life but when something like that happens, it was a wonderful community.
                    They all came together. They helped out very much both psychologically and in
                    other ways to help this family. I see both of those aspects in my town. My
                    sister and my mother still live there so I get back several times a year.</p>
                <p>Q: What about at school, first in the elementary, what sort of appealed to you in
                    elementary school? Any particular studies?</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: This is something that haunted me through college because I thought I
                    wanted to be a scientist. I loved physics, the various maths, and so on, and I
                    really thought I wanted to be a physicist. This was my great desire. I will
                    never forget the science teacher in high school who was one of the teachers in
                    that small town that I admired the most. I went to him one day because he seemed
                    to know the answer to everything. I really thought physics can explain so much
                    and this is wonderful. I asked him, “You know Mr. Bratton, I really don't
                    understand E=MC squared,” and he said, “Neither do I.” I was taken aback by his
                    honesty and the fact that he had put some feet of clay around one of my idols. I
                    enjoyed that. I was very active in high school plays, art clubs. To this day I
                    regret that I wasn't very interested in music because I think that is a great
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about reading? Did you have any particular reading
                        that yoliked to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: In high school I can't really recall, nothing comes to mind. Later in
                    college, when it became obvious that science was not my forte, I acquired, and
                    still retain to this day, a great interest in history books, in historical
                    novels and in straight history. I do a lot of reading about that. Because we
                    lived close to Mexico when I was growing up - I suppose this is part of some
                    interest in Latin America which also pursued me into college and into graduate
                    school. There were the braceros and wet backs. The farm laborers in the area
                    would bring up hundreds and hundreds of Mexicans, entire families.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They would be wet backs because they were illegal
                        aliens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: That's right, some were brought legally and wet backs refers to those
                    who swim across. I got to know some of those people and would speak broken
                    Spanish to them. Later in life when I was in college I actually boarded a
                    bracero bus in Arkansas and rode it all the way down into Mexico with a bunch of
                    laborers returning to their homes. I then went on to tool around Latin America
                    doing some research on a master's thesis at the time. There were aspects of a
                    small town that were international which I suppose put the seeds in one way or
                    another into all of us who moved into this career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from high school in what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: '56.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Little Rock Central High School hit when you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: It was in '57.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I was at Rice University in Houston, Texas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why Rice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: The main reason is that I got a full scholarship to go to Rice but in
                    those days that meant simply being accepted. Rice had been very heavily endowed
                    by a wealthy Texas oil man and real estate speculator, William Marsh Rice. Rice
                    had set up an educational institution and he stipulated in his will, “for the
                    education of poor white boys at the secondary school level.” Now that is not
                    what Rice University is today by any stretch of the imagination. They kept
                    breaking his will over the years. When I went there in '56, everybody had a full
                    scholarship. You applied to Rice, you were accepted, and there was no tuition. I
                    joined the army ROTC and they even had a small stipend there that helped defray
                    some other expenses. It was a good school. It was very good in sciences and that
                    was what I still thought I wanted to do at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was there about three weeks ago and looking at some of
                        thbuildings with big presses, and lots of machinery, and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Ed Djerejian, whom you probably know, is now heading thBaker School
                    down there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. When you were at Rice, how did you find it? What sort
                        omoved you off the science track?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Flunking calculus and a few things like that. It's a wonderful way of
                    focusing the mind, not quite facing the firing squad. I found it much too rote
                    for what I wanted. You learned the math. You learned the calculus. You learned
                    the biology. I suppose I didn't want to feel that bound and it showed in my
                    grades. As a matter of fact I wasn't even accepted as a physics major. They
                    said, “You can transfer if you do well in some of the basic courses.”</p>
                <p>The other interest I had at the time was art. Rice didn't have art. Rice was very
                    scientifically oriented. The Baker Institute, or whatever it is called, didn't
                    exist. It was heavily scientific so the next best thing was architecture. I was
                    enrolled as an architecture student and I actually pursued that for a couple of
                    years until that became too scientific. It was very heavy on engineering and I
                    was much more into the design side of things.</p>

                <p>Rice was a tough row for me. It was a tough school. They had an attitude back in
                    the '50s and '60s - and I think a lot of schools had dropped this attitude - but
                    I think it was an attitude... We were called together as the freshman class of
                    I've forgotten how many, a couple of hundred. It was a small school. There were
                    only about 1,800 students entirely at the time I was there and it is not even
                    double that now; it is still a small school. We were called together and the
                    dean of students got up and said, “Look to your right and look to your left, one
                    of you is going to be gone in a year. We are going to see to it.” I don't agree
                    with that philosophy of education. I didn't then, and I still don't.They lived
                    up to their promise and I suppose sheer stupidity and stubbornness kept me in
                    that school. I said “By damn I'm going to finish this place. I'm going to get a
                    BA out of here then get the hell out of here.” I did finally in sociology. In
                    terms of classical style education, I went from two years solid of architecture,
                    to a sociology degree, and then actually I got a degree in philosophy when I
                    finally got out of there. It was a tough school. I didn't like Houston and I
                    still don't like Houston. Forgive me if you're from Houston. It is one of the
                    hottest, wettest places I've ever been in my life.</p>

                        mossterile place I have ever seen in my life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes, it is incredible, isn't it.?</p>
                <p>Q: I find it really incredible. I mean it is just very forbidding. I'm sort of
                    looking up at tall building and walking the streets there and it is just
                    awful.</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: There is not much sense. The Buffalo Bayou is not a bad little spot of
                    green there but it is nothing compared to San Antonio which is a charming
                    town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about social life there, how did you find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Social life in high school was a hell of a lot more rewarding. It was a
                    small group, a small town. High school was easy for me scholastically so there
                    was a lot of time. College was exactly the opposite and most people at Rice were
                    very, very dedicated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess it was mostly men, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes. It is better now but at that time it was more than three quarters
                    male. They were in the college system which was a residential dorm and you ate
                    together and so on. There were something like four men's colleges and one
                    woman's college so that was the division. The women were in at ten o'clock at
                    night, and there were curfews and all which we find hard to believe these days.
                    There were no fraternities which appealed to me because I had been in a high
                    school fraternity and began to think it was kind of silly. It was also part of
                    this study, study, study, atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Football players were as we all know a special breed back then. They were in Rice
                    but there was the athletes' math class, athletes' chemistry class, and so on. I
                    roomed with some and it was an interesting experience. I roomed with almost
                    semi-professional football players. I never had that kind of experience before.
                    One roommate was from Washington, DC and another was from New York City. It
                    started to broaden a pretty provincial background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you all get involved with the politics of the
                        times?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: No. Remember these were the '50s. I graduated in '60.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The silent generation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Absolutely, and it really was. There was very little interest in what
                    was going on. I was still interested in Latin America and traveled to Mexico a
                    couple of times while we were down there and into the southwest, but it was that
                    kind of thing. It wasn't the great issues. The demonstrations that I remember at
                    Rice were about raising the fees in the cafeteria and things like that. There
                    was student activity but it wasn't in the great issues of the day as came along
                    in the '60s.</p>
                <p>Q: Why Mexico and why Latin America? Was it exotic or was it just something
                    different?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: As I said there was part of that background of being close to Arkansas,
                    and having known some Mexicans, having traveled down there when I was in high
                    school. I studied Spanish. I liked my Spanish teacher in high school. I
                    continued to study Spanish while at Rice. And then there was the proximity. It
                    was easy to get to. By the time the '60s were coming along, as you will recall
                    we were talking about the “Alianza para el Progreso” [Alliance for Progress] and
                    this was a coming area of the world, it's going to be our neighbor, and we are
                    going to develop, and so on. I can remember arguing with friends who were
                    specializing in Soviet studies and I would say, “Latin Americans is the coming
                    place to be.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any jobs or anything like that outside of
                        ROTC?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: When I was in school I did during the summers. I went back and worked
                    in my father's office one summer, and I worked in a bank in this small town. I
                    went out to Colorado one summer and worked in Rocky Mountain National Park which
                    was a wonderful experience and I'll never forget it. I made a lot of friends out
                    there and enjoyed the hiking. It was a real dude ranch where people really knew
                    horses, really knew trails, and that sort of thing. Once again, I hadn't had
                    that much in my background, so it was a tremendous experience. One summer in
                    order to make up for the calculus and other things, I went to summer school at
                    what was then Southwestern and what is now Rhodes in Memphis, Tennessee. When I
                    got into graduate school, I worked at the Special Operations Research Office
                    [SORO] which is part of American University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated in 1960?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whither and what were you thinking about doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: By that time I had two favorite teachers there at Rice. One a history
                    professor and the other was a history of religions professor. I was active in
                    the Presbyterian youth group there and went to a couple of conventions. I
                    visited Chicago, that forbidden land for a lot of southerners, for the first
                    time in my life. I went to Lake Forest and met Adlai Stevenson, after he had
                    been the candidate, of course. That was a wonderful experience. I was sort of
                    toying between going into religious studies, but the other professor who really
                    influenced me a lot was a history professor. I decided that I really wasn't
                    sure.</p>
                <p>Since my father had saved so much money on no tuition at Rice, he agreed to fund
                    graduate school. I went to the National University of Mexico in Mexico City for
                    a summer course between school and graduate school. It was close; I spoke some
                    Spanish; I was interested in the area. That sort of really swayed me in the
                    direction of international relations. I decided that if I was going to go into
                    that, I should choose the place to study, rather the geographic location. I
                    chose Washington. I said I wanted to go to Washington. Definitely that's the
                    place to go if you are going to study international relations.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>I applied to all the universities and the best deal I got was American
                    University. George Washington (GW), I think, offered me something. I don't think
                    I got into Georgetown. Anyway, the School of International Service was fairly
                    young at the time. Ernest Griffith was the dean and had a tremendous reputation
                    from a lot of activities. I met him, talked to him, interviewed with him
                    personally, and was very impressed. Harold Davis was the head of the Latin
                    American department and he was an impressive man. That sort of led me to prepare
                    myself with Mexico. I did some history and language studies down there that
                    summer, and then came up to American University.</p>
                <p>Q: At the University of Mexico, did you pick up any feel for the Latin American
                    educational form, I mean the culture, as opposed to the American one or was it
                    pretty much sort of a summer school for Americans?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: It was a summer school for the Americans but we lived in a Mexican
                    home; we didn't stay in a dorm. We lived with a family and we would practice our
                    Spanish and talk with them at night about our experiences. It wasn't for
                    Americans alone. It was basically language training for foreigners but I took
                    some courses which were in Spanish with other students. We also traveled quite a
                    bit.</p>
                <p>We traveled on that particular occasion all the way down the Pan American Highway
                    to Costa Rica in a beat up old Volkswagen that a friend of mine had down there.
                    We ran into a cow in Honduras or Guatemala, I've forgotten now, and memories
                    come back to you about being scared to death in the middle of the night when we
                    ran into the cow. The car was on fire and all of a sudden we were surrounded by
                    a bunch of people. There were no lights at all. We thought we were in the middle
                    of nowhere and we thought we've had it. They said, “It's not our cow. It belongs
                    to the big landholder here. We'll take the cow and we'll help you get your car
                    out of here.” We were saved. It was interesting and it was something which stuck
                    with me.</p>
                <p>You sort of relate your own experiences to the very roteness of higher education
                    in many of these Napoleonic-influenced countries. You choose to be an engineer
                    and that is basically all you study at the graduate level, and we noted that. We
                    were down there studying history, language, cultural studies, and so on, and
                    there were Mexican students who were studying nothing but civil engineering and
                    very little else in their careers. It was sort of a wake up call for the
                    appreciation of our more liberal arts and widely varied education. It was a good
                    experience, particularly the traveling part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at American University from 1960 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Actually off and on from 1960 until 1965. I got two degrees out of
                    there. I got a masters degree in Latin American studies in '63 and then
                    completed course work while I was in the military. I went into the military in
                    '63. I did ROTC and deferred it until '63 while doing graduate work and working
                    part-time at SORO, which was a research arm of American University. I don't know
                    if part of it still exists. I still think they have what is called the Foreign
                    Area Studies Division that does the area handbooks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think they do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: This was a part of it. This was where I met my wife. She worked in that
                    part and I worked in another section of SORO. I went into the military in '63
                    and continued to study. I got a masters of international studies in
                    international relations in '65, the year I got out of the army. I sort of
                    continued that relationship. It was fortunate, though I didn't think it was
                    fortunate at the time because I wanted to go overseas with the military, I still
                    had that itch. The closest I got to going overseas was getting based right back
                    here at the Pentagon in the Latin America area again. As a matter of fact I was
                    right here. Their intelligence agency was in Arlington Hall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are in now the Foreign Service Institute, which was the
                        olArlington Hall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I knew it well. Of course there were the old buildings which I guess
                    were further over here at the time. I considered it fortunate to be related to
                    Latin America. We were doing research on Cuba which was still a pretty hot topic
                    at the time. I got to do some interviews with some Cuban �migr�s, escapees. I
                    did those kinds of interviews and so on. That was interesting.</p>
                <p>I contributed to the project from what I was doing for American University and
                    also, the masters thesis... I'm trying to think which year I traveled. I think
                    it was just before I went into the military, various friends and I, but one of
                    them stuck with me the whole time, traveled throughout Latin America for about
                    six months. I did my thesis on the politically active student. What I did was I
                    conducted interviews with student leaders in four countries, Venezuela,
                    Colombia, Peru and Argentina.You were talking earlier about the lack of student
                    activity at Rice during the '50s and the great difference as the '60s began to
                    develop, particularly in Latin America and in Mediterranean societies, in Italy,
                    Spain, and in other places, a great deal of activity. That sort of formed the
                    basis for that trip that I took just before I went into the military for two
                    years. I then did the military. After that I was fortunate to get a job with INR
                    [Bureau of Intelligence and Research] at the Department of State on a contract
                    basis doing research on the Latin American military.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Q: Before we move ahead, what were you getting from the students? I always have
                    the feeling that the Latin American students could do whatever they wanted on
                    campuses and student activities were usually heavily dominated by university
                    Marxists but as soon as they got out they went off and became bankers, or the
                    equivalent thereof. What were you finding?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: You did certainly find that and I interviewed students who were
                    ex-student leaders as well as current student leaders. Of course the current
                    student leaders tended not to accept that. “Well I'll be different. I won't do
                    that. I will continue to serve the good.” But I think in general terms the way
                    you described it is accurate. They would tend to be leftists. They would tend to
                    be socialist Marxist, and they would say that though they wouldn't necessarily
                    admit to being communists. I think in their own minds it wasn't admitting to it,
                    they just didn't think that they were. They didn't necessarily think that the
                    Soviet Union was a model to follow and they certainly didn't think the United
                    States was a model to follow. But they felt somewhere was a third road, a
                    development of a socialist society. A lot of it had to do with the social
                    injustice that was quite easy to see around them, and it was certainly there,
                    and they tended to blame it on the United States. “You dominate the area. You
                    dominate the economy,” they said.</p>
                <p>We can jump ahead and then go back again. My first Foreign Service assignment was
                    as a student affairs officer; something that the Kennedys had started. I was a
                    cultural affairs officer but dealing mainly with students, both university and
                    high school students, in Venezuela. Once again I thought I was very fortunate,
                    my first Foreign Service assignment was exactly in the area that I wanted to go
                    to and in a country where I knew some people because I had done this research. I
                    knew some of the, by that time, former student leaders, but clearly it would be
                    an entree into that world.</p>
                <p>They were very dedicated to changing society. Some of them were very poor
                    students and some were very wealthy students and it was kind of egalitarian in
                    that once you were in the university you didn't draw social distinctions. Once
                    you got out and went to work for Creole, which was the Esso-Exxon owner of a
                    large part of petroleum resources productions in Venezuela at the time, it
                    became a different matter. But at that point if you were in a particular
                    political party or in a particular political movement then you cut across the
                    economic barriers that existed in the society.</p>
                <p>Venezuela more than a lot of the countries that I dealt with - perhaps because of
                    the petroleum domination by U.S. companies at the time which subsequently have
                    been nationalized, but it was a peaceful nationalization after I served there -
                    tended to look at the United States thinking that if you would allow us to have
                    more control over our economic resources here, we could then make this a more
                    just society. No matter how much you talked to some of them, it was very
                    difficult to persuade them that some of the first steps had to be their own, not
                    the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Their conviction that Marxism was an answer, was one of the reasons that after
                    Venezuela I said if we are going to continue to try to deal with these future
                    leaders of these developing countries, who by and large identify themselves with
                    Marxism, I want to go where it really exists. I got myself assigned to Eastern
                    Europe, to Yugoslavia because I said, “I think we have to know what we are
                    talking about.” At that stage in my life, I had never even traveled to any of
                    the socialist countries. A lot of those students hadn't either, but some of them
                    had and they would tell you what a wonderful experience it had been going to a
                    summer school in Budapest and how wonderful society was in Prague, and I
                    couldn't rebut them. I think a lot of it was youthful enthusiasm but to be very
                    honest with you, as we look at Latin America today, there is still a lot to be
                    done down there today and we need a lot more idealism.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the background of your wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: She had grown up mainly in the Chicago area. Her father was a
                    businessman and had worked for a variety of companies. He worked for Bausch and
                    Lomb, and for a number of places. He was mainly a management consultant so he
                    had lived in a variety of places, but for most of her formative years in high
                    school until she went off to college, she lived in the Chicago area. She then
                    came to Hood College in Frederick for her first two years. It was a girls school
                    at the time. Frederick, as she described at the time, was about 1,000 miles from
                    Washington; a very small little town. She transferred to American University and
                    we met both in some classes and then working for SORO at American
                    University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in INR, what were you working on? It was
                        1965-66?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Right. It was a project with Professor Karl Schmidt, a professor from
                    the University of Texas. He was a specialist in Latin American studies. He was
                    the chair of the project and he had several people working for him, some Foreign
                    Service officers and some contracts. I've forgotten how I linked up with him. It
                    was probably some reference from the army or maybe American University, I can't
                    remember. He brought me onto his team. The project was somewhat related to the
                    study I had done on the Latin American students but this was on the Latin
                    American military. What's their mind set? What motivates them? Why do they go
                    into this career? How do they feel about coups d'etat? All this sort of thing.
                    It was basically an unclassified sociological study with interviews, reading
                    files, and so on.</p>
                <p>Q: What were we coming out with at that time? In the first place, did there seem
                    to be a military class in Latin America that could identify from one country to
                    another country, or was each country sort of different?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: That's a good question. I don't know. We drew parallels because of
                    common Hispanic backgrounds, relatively recent independence in the 1800s for
                    most of the countries in Latin America, efforts of forming unions, the Central
                    American Pact and so on, in which there was collaboration, then breaking apart
                    and again collaboration. Memory dims but as I recall except for specific
                    regional agreements in some cases, the military didn't cooperate that much. More
                    likely it was a rivalry situation. You had a whole history. Ecuador and Peru, up
                    until this day, even though they may have had similar mind sets, they were very
                    nationalistic and defend the flag, the fatherland, the motherland. This little
                    strip of land that nobody really cares about except on the maps - the military
                    would say, “We will defend this.” It was mainly a feeling, I think, that they
                    were bringing law and order to the country and the military felt that they would
                    establish a certain stability to society and in a lot of ways that preserved the
                    powers and the interests that be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling in the '65 to '66 period, that this
                        is hoLatin America is going to be basically governed most of the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: No, I don't think so really. As mentioned earlier, you were still in
                    the Lyndon Johnson administration and this was a heritage of the Kennedy
                    administration. The Alliance for Progress was still active, if not as active.
                    Johnson of course was being further drawn into the Vietnam War in another part
                    of the world but with his Texas background and from the legacy of the Kennedy
                    administration I think there was still a lot of hope for Latin America. If you
                    recycle the themes enough, you can hear about the development of democracy in
                    Latin America today and how all but one country is democratic, and there was
                    talk about that.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>We were marching toward a more democratic society, toward free and unfettered
                    elections. That was an effort to bring the military into line with that and of
                    course with all of the criticism of the infamous School of the Americas, the
                    effort of the military at the time was to train military leaders in democratic
                    thoughts and make them feel responsible, but also under civilian authority. I
                    think that was the ambiance at the time that we would move gradually, and with
                    deliberation, away from more authoritarian societies into more democratic
                    ones.</p>
                <p>Q: How were we explaining this military dominance practically over an entire area
                    except for Mexico? Why Mexico? Why was its military kept off to one side
                    successfully?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: That's a good question. Mexico likes to say, and of course you have
                    heard it as frequently as I have, that they are the only country that, aside
                    from the independence movement, underwent a revolution when they threw out
                    Porfirio Diaz and had Zapata, Carranza, Pancho Villa, and the others. This was a
                    true revolution and then they went about establishing the permanent
                    revolutionized party, Partido Revolucionario Institucional. This is what people
                    are squabbling about today; can you have an institutionalized revolution?</p>
                <p>I think that the effort to diminish the clerical influence in Mexico, along with
                    that revolution, continues until today. I haven't been to Mexico for several
                    years, but I understand that you are beginning to see more clerical frocks in
                    the streets now. But when I was down there studying in the summer of 1960, you
                    didn't see nuns in habits, you didn't see priests on the road, or very few. I
                    think that the whole idea of a hierarchical military and church, that Mexico
                    felt that they had somehow broken with their these various revolutionary
                    movements. How true, we are wondering today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the stint in INR attract you towards the Foreign
                        Service ohad you thought about it before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I thought about it before. As a matter of fact, when I was in graduate
                    school I took the Foreign Service exam and passed it. I was offered an
                    assignment and chose to defer it. I said, “I'm not ready yet. I want to do some
                    more studying. I want to do some more traveling.” The stint in INR, I felt, was
                    interesting, but it was sort of like being in Venezuela and having to talk on a
                    daily basis with Marxists. I want to know what it is really like and join the
                    Foreign Service. Fortunately, I was able to renew the earlier offer and said,
                    “Okay, I'm ready now.” I joined in 1966.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why USIA? Was there a choice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: There was a choice. As you know, the history of the Foreign Service,
                    we've gone back and forth between FSOs and FSIOs and FSRs and everything. At
                    that time I was a commissioned Foreign Service officer and all I did was check a
                    box. The reason was that when I was doing research on the politically active
                    students throughout Latin America, I was still very interested in Latin America
                    and wanted to go to that area. The most helpful people had been student affairs
                    officers and they were USIS people. I thought they were closer to the society,
                    they knew more of what was going on in the schools and in the various
                    institutions, and so on. I liked working with people.</p>
                <p>I liked the politics, too. To be a political officer appealed to me but I had no
                    interest in the economic side of things. I decided that if I don't like this, I
                    am an FSO and I can become a political officer the next time around. I went into
                    it and was fortunate to get an assignment to Venezuela as student affairs
                    officer which I liked very much. The next assignment that I asked for in Eastern
                    Europe came along and USIA came through again, so I decided to stick with
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was you Foreign Service basic officer course like and
                        thpeople in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: It was an A-100 course. We were all together. There must have been
                    maybe 25 or so State Department officers and about a dozen USIA officers in the
                    class. There were very few women at that time and from a range of people, some
                    who were just fresh out of school... A wonderful little anecdote that you can
                    throw out I'll never forget. One of my classmates came from Brooklyn. He went to
                    Brooklyn High School, Brooklyn College. You had to give a little talk about
                    yourself in the A-100 class, where you come from, what your background was. This
                    guy gets up and says, “I went here and I went there and yes, I traveled
                    overseas; I went to Jersey once.” He was straight out of college.</p>
                <p>It was an unusual class. I think there were about four or five Ph.D.s in the
                    class. Roger Morris was in my class. He's become an author since then. Also
                    Frank Hodsoll, who worked for the National Endowments. We had some people with
                    distinguished backgrounds even when they entered the A-100 course. We were a
                    pretty tight group and a number of us still keep up with each other even to this
                    day. It was a broader course I think in a sense because it was an A-100 course,
                    we took the consular aspects of it, and economic. We then got our
                    assignments.</p>

                </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation like in Venezuela like at
                        thatime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: It wasn't that far away from its own revolution or rather democratic
                    coup. Perez Jimenez had been dictator up until, as I recall, something like '58.
                    An admiral had led the coup by the name of Larrazabal. He had tried to install
                    himself as the transition to democracy but he had been rejected and he had
                    allowed elections.</p>
                <p>We were in Venezuela for their first transitional elections. In order words,
                    after Betancourt had taken over for the Accion Democratica [AD] Party, the
                    Copeyanos, which were the Christian Democratic Party, was a strong democratic
                    opposition to the Acekos which were more of a Social Democratic Party. The
                    Christian Democratic Party had a lot of ties to European parties and a lot of
                    advice and probably some assistance. The question was, and the whole atmosphere
                    was, whether there would be allowed a democratic transition or whether the AD
                    Party would assume themselves as the carriers of democracy, and want at least
                    one more term.</p>
                <p>Of course, a lot of the students that I was dealing with at the university were
                    very leftist and some all the way over to very pro-Castro parties. You'll recall
                    we are not that far away from the Castro revolution in '59. There will still
                    guerrilla groups in the hills in Venezuela. This was when Castro and his cohorts
                    were trying to foment indigenous revolutions in other countries. The embassy had
                    been shot up a number of times and it happened at least once or twice which I
                    was there. People would come by and spray the front of the embassy to indicate
                    that they wanted the Americans out of the country; not only the economic
                    interests but the diplomatic interests as well. There was a lot of foment with
                    this sort of revolutionary process.</p>
                <p>You will recall we are talking about the '60s now with the student revolutions
                    going on in Europe and in the United States. After you had Kennedy killed and
                    then in '68 Martin Luther King was killed, Bobby Kennedy was killed, Washington
                    is occupied; you had front page pictures in the major newspaper in Caracas of
                    armed troops in the capital of the United States, it began to look like maybe
                    these students had a point. “We had been telling you, you are no example. Look
                    at what is happening to your society. You are coming apart.”</p>
                <p>But '68 was also Prague Spring. It was a terrible blow to the Marxist students
                    there. Then they began to say, “We told you we never believed the Soviet Union
                    and their cohorts. This is terrible. Dubcek was the future. The human face of
                    socialism.” There was a lot of turmoil both in their philosophy and in how they
                    would interpret that to Venezuela. There was a tremendous amount of activity on
                    the campus. I did a lot of reporting on conversations with students based on
                    what we were all reading in the newspapers, based on what other people were
                    hearing from their senior party officials about what this whole process meant
                    for the future of Venezuela.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>At the same time, there was talk about the only way this country can progress is
                    to have more economic independence from the United States. All the major oil
                    companies were there. Not only U.S. companies like Exxon, Mobil, and Texaco, but
                    also Shell. This was how Venezuela was a pretty affluent country at that time.
                    There were certainly huge pockets of poverty in the interior but Caracas was a
                    very wealthy city. It reminded me a little bit of Los Angeles. It was pretty
                    sterile and uninteresting but affluent with big skyscraper buildings. People
                    would see this and say this country has to move and what direction are we going
                    to move in? From my perspective, it was fascinating to try to maintain contacts
                    with as many of the student leaders of the various political parties during this
                    process and to see what their thinking was.</p>
                <p>One of the proudest things that I managed to pull off while I was there was to
                    get a group, not the most extreme left and we avoided the most extreme right,
                    but pretty much a rainbow spectrum of student leaders of all the major parties,
                    and send them to the United States on one of these leader exchange programs. We
                    put a dozen of them all on the same plane. They spent three weeks together in
                    the United States. That was the way to not only show what we are really doing up
                    here, but when they come back they have this tremendous kind of rapport among
                    themselves as well.</p>
                <p>The Christian Democratic Party won the elections. It was a peaceful transition.
                    Venezuela did not live happily ever after by any means, but a lot of people felt
                    satisfied with the progress at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: For the entire time I was there a very professional man by the name of
                    Maurice Bernbaum who had served at least three times in Venezuela before. As he
                    told me he had been the junior consular officer, then he came back as a
                    political officer, and this was his third if not fourth tour. Jumping ahead a
                    little bit, it reminds me that I served under Jack Matlock in the Soviet Union
                    and there were tremendous advantages to seeing a country develop over a period
                    of time.</p>
                <p>Bernbaum was a consummate professional Foreign Service officer. He spoke the
                    language well, knew the country well and knew a lot of people. He made a comment
                    one time which I thought was quite interesting that one of the things that he
                    regretted is that as you naturally progress from being a lowly consular officer
                    to the ambassador to the country, you have to leave friends behind. You don't
                    leave them entirely behind but you no longer have that kind of relationship. You
                    simply can't. You are representing your country, your entire mission. He said it
                    was one of the regrets he had about having served so continuously. On the other
                    hand, as I say, he knew the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>He was a tremendous first exposure to me for an ambassador particularly since, as
                    I was traveling as a student through Central America, I had run into ambassadors
                    - and a number of them I know were political appointees - who I felt were not
                    representing our country best. I was young, hardly a firebrand, but a
                    “we-can-change-the-world” kind of student, and to sit in San Salvador and to
                    listen to the ambassador say, “Well, our interests are with the government that
                    exists here...” I felt that when I got to Bernbaum, there was a man who
                    understood that societies do have to develop and I think he was trying his best
                    to represent both the interests of the United States first and foremost, but
                    also to adequately portray the interests of Venezuela.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the Dominican Republic crises where we intervened come
                        uwhile you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I was in the military at that time. I was actually detailed to the
                    Pentagon a couple of times in the war rooms during it. I saw that from a
                    different perspective.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought that as the student affairs officer, to go on some of
                    these campuses it would have been almost dangerous because they'd think, that
                    guy is a CIA agent or something. Did you find yourself having to deal with
                    that?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: My predecessor had warned me of something that happened to him and I
                    never forgot it, I haven't to this day. He once went to a student rally on the
                    campus of the University Centrale de Venezuela which could become a closed
                    campus. It was a compound and you could close the gates off. It worked in both
                    directions. The military could close the students in, and the students could
                    close whomever they wanted to out. He went to a rally shortly before I got
                    there. It was in a large hall and he didn't tell anybody he was coming. He went
                    on the campus and went into this rally. It was held in an auditorium and he said
                    all of a sudden somebody recognized him and they passed the word. From the stage
                    they said, “In the back row there is a CIA agent.” He said he ran out of there
                    and he didn't stop running until he hit the first gate he could come to.</p>
                <p>I would either not get myself backed into a corner like that - I probably would
                    have done the same thing, it was hindsight wisdom - or I would have let people
                    know I was coming so that certain people would know I was going to be on campus.
                    I would go on campus and if a large rally was going on I would exercise
                    discretion rather than valor and stay away from the thing. I would always let
                    somebody in the embassy know where I was going to be. I was able to go onto
                    campus pretty unfettered with those exceptions.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>The student attitude towards the entire embassy was that we represented the
                    stated interests. What you had to do, as a lot of us do in this business, is
                    establish personal contacts. We've heard this many times throughout our careers,
                    “We like you. It is your government we don't like.” That was the kind of
                    relationship. Believe it or not, and I surprise myself when I look back on it, I
                    actually got the political counselor talked into going and giving a lecture on
                    campus about our involvement in Vietnam. Of course, it was a hot debate but it
                    wasn't a violent debate. They didn't refuse to let him come onto the campus.
                    They didn't refuse to let him deliver his talk and they let him have his say.
                    There was enough of a rapport built up. “We don't agree with you but we will
                    listen to you and we think you are honest enough that you will listen to us.”
                    For heavens sake, none of us agreed with everything we were doing in
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Q: Was the expropriation or nationalization of the oil companies something that
                    everyone was waiting for? Was that something that was expected there?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: There was certainly a lot of talk about it and I think the main concern
                    was - how it was going to be done? Was adequate compensation going to be
                    offered? The oil companies, as time developed, I think they were ready for it if
                    they could get what they considered to be their fair shake out of the thing. The
                    various political parties cooperated with each other as I say with the exception
                    of the extremes on both ends in terms of saying we want to get as much as we can
                    out of this. This is our natural resource but we don't want to break relations
                    so that they are not going to refine our oil in Aruba or some place. I think
                    that was the main concern.</p>
                <p>I came to know some of the people pretty well in the oil companies, too. I was
                    fortunate in that my father-in-law had been a management consultant for the
                    Creole Company in the late '50s. He was there when Perez Jimenez was overthrown
                    so he saw a revolution underway. The director for public relations, who was
                    originally a Czech citizen, and then became a Venezuelan citizen, and
                    subsequently has become an American citizen, was a fellow I knew personally
                    through an introduction of my father-in-law. He introduced me not only to the
                    people who were working on how to make the transition to the nationalization of
                    the oil companies a feasible policy, but to people who had been former student
                    leaders who were now working for Creole so I could get their perspective.</p>
                <p>Creole actually sat overlooking a part of the Central University campus. We would
                    sit at the window and say, “You used to sit over there and say we are going to
                    burn that building down someday, and now you are sitting in here. What is your
                    justification?” The students would say, “I was younger. I was impetuous. But now
                    we are working from within the system to try to change the system.” Most of them
                    were intelligent enough individuals with a fairly plausible explanation in their
                    own self justification for not being on the ramparts anymore.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I never served in Latin America and when one listens to
                        accounts you have sort of the feeling that the students spent an awful lot
                        of time in political agitation and confrontation. How about studying? What
                        was your impression of the universities as a purveyor of education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: You've asked two very good questions really. I can't remember the
                    statistics or the estimated statistics any more, I have them in my paper. Your
                    really politically active students were a small percentage of the overall
                    student population. Most of the students were there to study. They wanted to be
                    there to get an education. A lot of them resented the political activities and
                    would say, “We don't want to go on a strike. You are going to delay our
                    education by six months or a year if you persist in this kind of stuff.” We
                    touched upon this a little bit earlier, the whole matter of how good an
                    education they were getting I think is debatable to this very day.</p>
                <p>In the '60s, the universities in many of these countries began to open their
                    doors entirely. There were essentially no entrance exams or any kind of an
                    entrance process so that anybody who had not even necessarily graduated from
                    high school, although that was usually the case, could walk into a university
                    and enroll themselves as a student.</p>
                <p>To me, what took away equally, if not more, from the pedagogical advantages of
                    the university were the so-called professional students. They weren't
                    necessarily the political students. The education was essentially free. You
                    could get a part-time job and support yourself eating very cheap meals. The
                    student meals were practically free. You were paying less than a buck a day to
                    eat. These were students who would stay there for years as professional
                    students, maybe politically active, maybe not politically active, but truly
                    drawing away from students who were dedicated to getting an education, to
                    getting a future profession. I saw the same thing in the national universities
                    in Italy. There were 35,000 students in Rome and how many of them were real
                    students?</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, and also there, no matter how good a degree you got it depended on whom
                    your family knew in order to get a job. That was the tragedy I always felt in
                    Italy because a person could have a superb education and for the most part it
                    didn't mean anything unless his family had connections.</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes. You were going to move into a certain area no mattewhat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that as the student affairs officer that you
                        couldn'help but be attracted to the political activists.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Obviously. Also we had some very good political officers in the embassy
                    at the time. Bill Luers was one of the heads of the political section and he
                    subsequently became ambassador to Czechoslovakia and head of the Metropolitan
                    Art Museum. And Kempton Jenkins, whose name you probably know. These were people
                    that I think appreciated and encouraged a fairly junior, and a fairly young
                    officer, working in these areas they considered important work and work that was
                    to be encouraged with rather than saying, “You go do whatever you like.” We
                    worked together very closely and Jenkins had a lot to do with getting my future
                    assignment into the Eastern European area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a Soviet hand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '69 you left. What did you do? Did you just ask to go
                        tEastern Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes, and I said why. I said that I think a lot of the future leaders of
                    a lot of these developing countries consider themselves to be Marxist and in
                    some cases have studied in some of these countries, and they've been offered
                    scholarships. I think it is important that we continue to work with them and
                    that it is therefore important that I get some Marxist education. At the time
                    not only were Jenkins and Luers pushing that as well, and both had had some
                    experience in the area, but a guy named Frank Shakespeare, the head of the U.S.
                    Information Agency at the time, was, too. His attitude was that everybody, if
                    you were worth your salt, was going to serve in a communist country because you
                    had to know the enemy.</p>
                <p>I got an assignment to Zagreb, Yugoslavia and I said, “Gee, that's great. Where
                    the hell is it?” I didn't know the area that well at the time. Zagreb was
                    something that I didn't even know how to pronounce.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get language training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I got language training though not enough. I didn't get as much as I
                    wanted because like the army, the Foreign Service's attitude was, hurry up and
                    get out there. I came out of Venezuela in something like November and by March
                    of '70 they were shipping us off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Zagreb from 1970 until when?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: There were only three Americans in USIS at the time. There was a branch
                    public affairs officer, his deputy, and a junior officer trainee. I was the
                    number two guy. I did a little bit of everything. They called me the deputy
                    branch public affairs officer, a very long title. We tended to divide it because
                    of my background. I did more of the information and press side of things. The
                    other fellow who had had more experience did the Fulbright exchange programs and
                    that sort of thing, which I didn't know that much about; I didn't have that
                    background. We worked very closely together. Dabney Chapman, I don't know if
                    you've got him in here on not, but Dabney is now retired in Shepherdstown. He's

                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: He had been desk officer and served in Belgrade. Can you talk about your
                    impression of, well I suppose I would say Yugoslavia but we are really talking
                    about Croatia at the time when you arrived there? This was brand new for you.
                    You hadn't been in Europe before.</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I had one short trip with the military, but I had never been in
                    Yugoslavia. It was unknown. We had talked obviously with a lot of people,
                    Jenkins, Luers, and others, who had served in that part of the world. I did a
                    lot of background reading and took some courses at GW [George Washington
                    University] and Georgetown before going out there, so from an academic point of
                    view I knew a fair amount about the place. But what really struck us was how
                    non-restrictive it was from what we had anticipated. Then I jump ahead to a
                    subsequent assignment in Moscow where, after Zagreb, we felt we knew what it was
                    like to live in a communist country, and we were knocked off our feet.</p>
                <p>In Yugoslavia, you could travel freely and you could go wherever you like. [It
                    was] clear that there were restrictions was not that Tito was a communist. My
                    personal opinion was that Tito had become Tito by that time and this was Tito's
                    country, Tito's revolution, Tito versus Stalin.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>When Nixon paid his first visit, I think, to that part of the world, he went to
                    Romania and I think it was on that very same visit, either coming or going, when
                    he stopped off to visit Tito. He came up to Croatia because Tito had been born
                    in Kumrovec, a small little town on the Croatia-Slovenia border. It was a shrine
                    at the time. Tito was very much alive.</p>
                <p>An interesting anecdote is that the press advance people - which is mainly who we
                    were working with - are always trying to ensure that the accompanying press
                    corps can practically sit in the lap of the visiting dignitaries. Finally, I had
                    to go over to a guy and say, “Look, there is real security here and you had
                    better believe me that when they say don't cross this line they mean it.” The
                    guy kept saying, “We can move up ten more paces. You just go tell them we are
                    going to do this.” I would negotiate, and go back and forth. Finally the
                    Yugoslav security guys said, “That's it. No more.” I said, “Why no more? Why not
                    here rather than there?” They said, “Because now Tito is coming. We don't care
                    what happens to Nixon. It's your worry.” I took him over and translated for the
                    U.S. guy and I said really if you go any further... That was sort of the
                    attitude toward who Tito was, and what he meant to the country.</p>
                <p>Then, during the time we were there, there was a relatively peaceful resolution
                    [compared] to the kind of breakdown that we see today. There were a lot of
                    autonomy movements within Croatia at the time, very active in pushing for more
                    autonomy, particularly more economic autonomy. They were not even talking about
                    independence at the time. All of a sudden - and I don't think anybody in
                    Belgrade, Zagreb or anywhere else saw this coming - Tito just said, “That's
                    enough. You are going to jail. You are out of office.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That happened during your time? CALLAWAY: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there also something, the theater or something,
                        where thCroatian banner came up or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: There were incidents like that. People wore the littlpins that you see
                    now, the little checkerboard symbols of Croatia.</p>
                <p>Q: I spent five years in Belgrade and my time was '62 to '67. Somehow I realize
                    only long after the time, it was a calm period, but we really were isolated from
                    the nationalism. We were caught up in sort of, the Serbs were there and we were
                    among the Serbs and we didn't get the feeling of other places. They were just
                    seen as, those are just minor local disturbances and all. Did you get a feeling
                    of the divide between Serbia and Belgrade, and Zagreb? Did this sort of permeate
                    your work?</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: As I said it certainly did in the actions that Tito took on the
                    national level, but it went beyond that. It was certainly sensitive at the time
                    but I think a lot of water had gone under the bridge at the time. When I first
                    went there we were able to send in reports directly from Zagreb on what's
                    happening, and how are things developing. As things became very bad, and
                    particularly after Tito made his move to remove certain people from office in
                    Croatia, the embassy decreed that all reporting from Zagreb would go through the
                    mission in Belgrade. This really chaffed us. The feeling was that we had enough
                    maturity. We were reporting. We weren't advocating. The sensitivities continued
                    right up until the time that James Baker traveled out there in '89 or '90, or
                    whenever it was, and said this is one country and that's what we stand by.</p>
                <p>Suddenly I am remembering how things were practically 20 years before that and
                    seeing that in many instances we sit in the capital and think that what goes on
                    in Maracaibo in Venezuela doesn't matter that much. I had never served before,
                    and never served since, in a consulate but I thought it was an extremely useful
                    experience in seeing that to many Zagrebchani, we were their embassy even though
                    they never talked about independence. They didn't look to the embassy in
                    Belgrade. They looked to that consulate and that consul general as the
                    representatives of the United States. The attitude that they had toward their
                    part of Yugoslavia, and to be able to express that, sort of without feeling we
                    had to flush it through a Belgrade screening process, was a real comeuppance to
                    me and I think frankly, rest his soul, to Orme Wilson as well.</p>
                <p>Q: I think so. It's only in retrospect almost 30 years later that I realize that
                    I really didn't know any Croatians. It wasn't as though if you are here in
                    Washington you meet people from all over the country.</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes, and you don't think anything about it.</p>
                <p>Q: Even the Croatians who worked in Belgrade all headed home on the weekends. You
                    were really restricted to a Serb society and there was a certain, I won't to say
                    blindness, but a lack of understanding I think on the part of leadership of what
                    was going on. Although from a practical point of view, nothing really happened
                    for 25 years. Who was our ambassador at the time?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: It was Leonhart. We can talk about that. Tom Enders was his DCM for
                    part of the time. We have traveled back to Yugoslavia a number of times. We
                    really thoroughly enjoyed the country and we had a lot of friends. We went back
                    most recently in the summer of '90 or '91.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Anyway, some incidents had already happened. As you will recall, at the Plitvice
                    Lakes, some foreign tourists had been killed. Who did it? Was it provoked? Did
                    the Serbs do it to bring shame upon the Croats or did the Croats do it to set up
                    the Serbs? There was a lot of debate about who was behind it, and we talked with
                    friends at the time.I'm sure you get, “You served in Yugoslavia, explain to us
                    what the hell is going on?” My response is, “I served in Yugoslavia and I
                    probably understand less than you do.” The kind of people that we dealt with
                    even up until '90, '91, said, “There is going to be trouble. There are going to
                    be hotheads. There is going to be violence. We will not go as far as
                    independence. The economic viability of this country is too important. We have
                    made too much progress. We need to stick together.” They sincerely believed it
                    and never would have instigated the kind of stupidity, I think, that has
                    happened since then.</p>
                <p>Nor did we see it in those two-and-a-half years that we were serving there... We
                    did know some Serbs and some other people, even more so in Slovenia because
                    people were drawn from the southern parts of the country to come up and work in
                    the factories. Even then Slovenia looked back to the Austro-Hungarian Empire and
                    thought fondly about those days. They wanted to be more economically independent
                    than the Croatians did because they were economically better off. It was the
                    same attitude that you heard in Italy: why is the south pulling all of our funds
                    away from Milan? There were some of the same kinds of arguments. Why are we
                    funding the south because they are lazy people who can't work very hard?</p>
                <p>The idea of resorting to war to achieve independence I think was beyond the pale.
                    They thought they had made a tremendous amount of progress. They thought they
                    could live side-by-side. We had a nursemaid who came in and helped us with the
                    kids every once in a while who was very Croatian nationalistic and she used to
                    tell horrible stories about how she would sleep with the dead at night in the
                    fields in order to avoid being slaughtered, reminiscent of the things you hear
                    about Kosovo going on right now. And yet she had neighbors that day who were
                    Serbs. It was in the past for her. It was a horrible past. It was a terrible
                    thing, but it wasn't any part of her planned future.</p>
                <p>There are people that I think that we don't see, as diplomats in whatever
                    country. We deal with educated, rational people who, even if they may be
                    communist and disagree with you in terms of what kind of a social system you
                    want to construct, are going to try, as we did with the former Soviet Union, in
                    every way they can to avoid killing each other. We, I think unfortunately, too
                    often tend to neglect the people who are willing to do the kind of hotheaded
                    things that we see today in Yugoslavia.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Q: And that the seeds for the present disaster were sown probably at their
                    mother's knee by telling horror stories, but it just took a Milosevic and a
                    Tudjman to carry this out. Of course another thing too at the time, and you
                    probably felt the same thing, the breakup of Yugoslavia was in a way unthinkable
                    at the time because if it started to break, that meant the Soviet Union could
                    mess in these murky waters and it could bring on World War III. No matter what
                    happened, you felt that this isn't going to happen because of the Cold War; it
                    is just too dangerous for everybody to do that. With the Cold War over, that
                    allowed the opportunity.</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: We tended to forget in the '60s and the '70s when you and I were
                    serving there, what we thought of Tito back in '45, '46, and '47 when he was in
                    Trieste shooting American planes down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Not the same thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your job sort of translate? What sort of work were
                        yodoing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: As I say, we were dealing mainly with the press and working with the
                    local television stations. We tried to place articles about U.S. society, U.S.
                    economy, in the Vremya, the Yugoslav Croatian paper. We tried to get either
                    interviews, or people, or programs placed on Croatian television programs. We
                    tried bringing exchange students in both directions, students and professors,
                    touring cultural groups, art exhibits, exhibits that we would take out to local
                    cultural centers and set up about the U.S. economy or the latest developments in
                    U.S. art.</p>
                <p>A big activity in Zagreb was that every year there was a commercial fair and we
                    worked very closely with the Department of Commerce on that. This was a big
                    deal, and Tito would come every year and inaugurate it. Every year of course we
                    tried to make a good show. We tried to do it somewhat in the same way that we
                    sent the exhibits in the Soviet Union and were able to travel into areas where
                    you normally couldn't travel to in the Soviet Union. This one was a fixed
                    installation and it gave us a presence in the most important second republic,
                    after Serbia, in Yugoslavia at the time.</p>
                <p>This was where we put our big effort. We are coming to Zagreb. We are coming to
                    you. It allowed people to see the latest in whatever particular thing we were
                    doing like electronics, or television, or whatever particular kitchen utensils
                    that we were featuring that year. Often they would be spinoffs of shows that had
                    been in the Soviet Union. We would adapt the language.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>A lot of it was maintaining contacts with people. The foreign editor of Vremya
                    was getting ready to go as the U.S. correspondent and didn't know English that
                    well, so I got my wife to teach him English. In that way we became close,
                    personal friends and it made it easier to get an occasional op-ed piece and
                    things like that. Naturally, we would set up extensive press coverage for a
                    presidential visit. We would set up various press centers in small towns if they
                    were going to visit Kumrovec, or at the airport, that kind of activity. A lot of
                    it was just trying to be the presence of the American government in Croatia,
                    which they considered to be extremely important.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you feeling at all the problem of having extreme Croatian nationalists,
                    particularly in Sweden and other places, and also in Chicago? Did they sort of
                    intrude on your territory at all from time to time?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Not really. It was interesting. Once again it was something akin to
                    what we were saying about the kind of people we would deal with. Most of the
                    people that we were dealing with felt that these people went too far. They
                    didn't want to see Croatians setting off bombs in Chicago or demonstrating at
                    rallies. The Serbs, of course, said they were Ustashi. To the extent that that's
                    true or not, I'm sure some of them were. They had fled the country. They had
                    gotten out. You didn't see that many people coming back into Croatia or paying
                    visits back to Croatia to sort of cement a relationship. They were in some ways,
                    as do many �migr� groups, reflecting on Italy, or Yugoslavia, or Croatia, which
                    no longer exists, they are remembering what it used to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's like in Cuba today, with the Cuban-Americans
                        today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: That's right. It's a society that probably never did exist and never
                    will. After that assignment, we can get to that, I became the desk officer for
                    Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania at USIA and that is where I dealt much more
                    with these Croatian �migr� groups. And you are quite right, we don't really
                    think about it much any more. It is a time that has passed. They were active at
                    the time. There were terrorist groups, and there was a concern about them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about travel? Was it pretty easy for people to get
                        out oYugoslavia to go to the West and all of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: One of the most fascinating trips I made in our Foreign Service career
                    was sometime around '71, we took a Yugoslav cruise ship and we sailed from Ra_a,
                    I guess. We went to Crete, Egypt, Lebanon, and Beirut. We didn't have diplomatic
                    relations with Egypt at the time. We had to have two passports because we then
                    went to Israel. We went into Beirut before it was destroyed.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>There was one other non-Yugoslav couple on the boat, an Italian couple, and we
                    were an American couple. Everybody else on that boat was Yugoslav. They were not
                    terribly wealthy Yugoslavs. It was interesting not only to travel and get to
                    know the Yugoslavs - by that time we were speaking decent Serbo-Croatian - but
                    to see those other countries from the perspective of Yugoslav tourists coming
                    in. It was interesting to see these people going out and seeing through their
                    eyes the other countries, seeing them experience another world. It is the kind
                    of thing that for most of the people we met in subsequent tours and visits in
                    the really restricted Soviet areas was startling because people from the Soviet
                    Union, Czechoslovakia, and Poland did travel outside, but they were really part
                    of an elite. You knew that you were very privileged, and you were coming back to
                    that area. But these were Yugoslav factory workers in some cases. They were
                    people who, if they could scrape up enough money to get on that boat, could go.
                    It was heartening to see that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there did Vietnam intrude much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Vietnam was much more of a presence in Venezuela where I was working
                    with the student groups. Obviously, the Yugoslav attitude was not favorable to
                    our intervention, but if you recall, Tito was one of the great leaders of the
                    third world movement. Tito's idea was to try to resolve that conflict through as
                    much involvement, mediation, and interjection of these other leaders of
                    Indonesia, India, some of the African countries.</p>
                <p>There were protests. There were marches and violence in Venezuela. I don't
                    remember one in Zagreb, there may have been a couple of rallies but it was more
                    of a rational kind of discussion. Once again you could sit down and you could
                    talk about Vietnam with them and try to explain some of the efforts at
                    rationale. Their efforts were more, why can't we peacefully resolve this thing,
                    some of the Russian arguments today.</p>
                <p>Q: Then you left to go where?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I came back as desk officer in the U.S. Information Agency for
                    Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania. We had no relations with Albania at the time
                    so the main thing there was the VOA broadcasts.</p>
                <p>Q: Why don't we stop at this point? We'll pick it up next time in 1972 when you
                    go back to be USIA desk officer for Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is 11th of May, 1999. Gil, you were USIA officer foYugoslavia, Albania and
                    Bulgaria from when to when?</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: From '72 to '74 when I went into Russian language training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We will talk again about Yugoslavia but what were we
                        doinvis-�-vis Albania and Bulgaria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: We had no diplomatic relations whatsoever with Albania at the time, so
                    what we were trying to do was both reach the people of Albania, and in a sense
                    to try to normalize relations with the communist leaders of Albania at the time,
                    working through the Voice of America. We did have Voice of America programs and
                    depending on how relations were going with the rest of the communist world and
                    what was happening in terms of mainly U.S.-Soviet relations, we would try to do
                    broadcasts which would show that our programs and exchanges, information
                    exchange particularly, would not be particularly harmful or threatening to the
                    regime. On the other hand if relations were not good, then we would try to get
                    the truth, the news, accurate information, into the people of Albania. That was
                    basically the relationship with Albania. It would go up and down largely based,
                    in my personal opinion, on our relationship with the Soviet Union, the great
                    mother communist state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't it at that time that Albania had been sort of part
                        of that great dual axis with Albania on one side and communist China on the
                        other side? Albania had gone the course of not repudiating Stalin at that
                        time and neither had China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during our opening to China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: Did that make any difference? Did you have a feeling that we were beginning to
                    take a different look at Albania saying maybe there is some hope here or doing
                    something?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: A good question. I certainly know very little about U.S.-Chinese
                    relations. China, and that whole area, is not my bag but as I said I certainly
                    saw it in terms of U.S.-Soviet relations. I think that in many cases we would
                    see relations with countries like Albania as satellites of either the Soviet
                    Union or of the People's Republic of China, and view it in those terms. As our
                    relationship with the Soviet Union went up and down, or back and forth, if you
                    will, then relations would either improve or become cooler with such places as
                    Albania or some of the Eastern European countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>I think what you say about China is probably the same. It was a big deal. It was
                    a big area that we had to deal with. I think we were still concerned, probably
                    right up until 1992, about the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China
                    getting back together. This coalition bothered us and any way that we could see
                    a loosening of ties with any of those countries, or a moving away from one of
                    the great rival powers, I think it was a plus, much as we were talking earlier
                    with Tito in Yugoslavia. We certainly didn't like Tito being a communist but the
                    fact that Yugoslavia moved itself away from the Soviet orbit led us to do
                    business with him. (End of tape)Q: This is tape two, side one with Gilbert
                    Callaway. You were saying...</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: You were asking about Bulgaria and our relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: As you will recall, at the time, Bulgaria was seen as the most faithful
                    Soviet satellite. Stalinists tried to do the Soviet Union even better after
                    Stalin left the scene in the Soviet Union in '53. Therefore, particularly from
                    the point of view of the USIA, the desk, and the operations room, we were trying
                    very hard to negotiate a cultural agreement with Bulgaria. We wanted the kind of
                    cultural agreement that we had with the Soviet Union at the time which was
                    foreign exchange of performing arts groups and art exhibits, but particularly
                    more in the educational area where so many students and professors could come to
                    this country and so many could go to the other country. We kept pointing to the
                    fact that we had done this with the Soviets, and the Soviet empire hadn't
                    collapsed so why couldn't we do this with Bulgaria.</p>
                <p>Of course, what we wanted to do was to loosen it up. With the Soviets it was
                    always a one-for-one and very strict, varied limits; you can do one or two
                    exhibits that we took into the Soviet Union and bicycle them around to various
                    cities. We wanted to do the same thing in Bulgaria and we wanted a loose
                    relationship, not to say it is going to be one-for-one or only two in the course
                    of a year, but why don't we work this out and see if we can have three or four.
                    We tried to do that with Bulgaria, but it didn't work. We did, during this
                    period that I was on the desk, complete a cultural agreement with the
                    Bulgarians. Little by little we tried to normalize relationships and also make
                    them see a different point of view of the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have a USIA representative in Bulgaria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes, we did. It was the same kind of relationship that we had in the
                    Soviet Union. We were not allowed to call ourselves the United States
                    Information Agency or even USIS, the United States Information Service, at the
                    time. In those countries we were called the press and cultural section of the
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How effective was it? I mean was there a library and that
                        sorof thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: There was a library. There were exhibits, and there were educational
                    exchange programs. To the extent that the host communist country would allow it,
                    I think it was extremely effective. That was one of the reasons that they wanted
                    to control it, to keep it within certain bounds and certain limits.</p>
                <p>You will recall of course the famous, or infamous, Khrushchev-Nixon debate in the
                    Soviet Union. It took place in one of our exhibits in which Khrushchev basically
                    said, “This is a bunch of propaganda. You don't really have kitchens like this
                    in the United States.” Nixon said, “Yes, this is representative of what we
                    have.” It sort of went on from there about perceptions and misperceptions of the
                    two countries.</p>
                <p>I think that the exhibits that went around the Soviet Union, and to a lesser
                    extent the satellite communist countries of Eastern Europe, were extremely
                    effective. The Soviets, Bulgarians, Romanians, and others limited the people who
                    could go to those exhibits, but thousands, and thousands of people went through
                    those exhibits. They had a chance to talk to young American people in their own
                    language and have a relatively open conversation with them, when for the most
                    part all they were seeing was the propaganda that had been coming out from their
                    governments about the United States and the relationships between those
                    countries. Many of the people who have gone into the Foreign Service, I think,
                    started out their careers as guides on those exhibits and felt that they were
                    extremely effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Bulgaria, for what we were trying to do, really
                        hostile ojust not very receptive? This is a nuance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: It is a good nuance. Not having served in Bulgaria, I will refer to my
                    experience in the Soviet Union. At least in the time that we served in the
                    Soviet Union in the mid-'70s, people were told every day that basically every
                    foreigner in the country was a spy of one kind or another, whether he or she be
                    a diplomat, a businessperson, or a correspondent. I think they believed this to
                    an extent because that is all they were told.</p>
                <p>The basic reason for the separation was that they could get into trouble if they
                    had too many relations with foreigners, or too frequent a contact with
                    foreigners. They would be questioned at their job and threatened with a
                    demotion, or being fired, or removed and sent out to a small village working on
                    a farm. Or they could be questioned even more threateningly and frighteningly by
                    the internal police force of those countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>I think that there was probably a very good disposition toward moving away from a
                    strict control of the communist system. My personal theory at the time is that
                    the people had been so indoctrinated by the bad side of capitalism, that they
                    wanted to move somewhere in-between to a socialist kind of system like the
                    Scandinavian states. They certainly didn't want communism, or were very against
                    it. But to go all the way to what they saw as free, unfettered capitalism scared
                    them, I think. There was a lot of curiosity and interest, but it was for moving
                    part way away from what they had, and part way towards what we had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you are in USIA now, how did you find the leadership
                        of USIat that particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: To be very frank, and we're away from those areas, it was a very Cold
                    War mentality. It harked back to the time that I came into USIA when I was
                    flatly told that I could serve in Vietnam now or later but by damn I was going
                    to serve in Vietnam. That was the attitude. It was felt that this particular
                    conflict was going to go on forever. We were going to be rotating information
                    and cultural types into Vietnam. By the early '70s, we were just beginning to
                    move away from the Vietnam conflict, and we were out by '75.</p>
                <p>Our leaders believed that we are going to be dealing with the communist world for
                    the foreseeable time and everybody who is going to make a successful career out
                    of the U.S. Information Agency (I suspect the State Department might have been
                    the same) is going to serve in a communist country. As I mentioned to you
                    earlier in the interview, I wanted to do this. I had been in Venezuela and had
                    dealt with Marxist leaning and leftist students, so it wasn't at all that I was
                    forced to go into this part of the world. I think I tended to believe that we
                    were going to be dealing with the communist Soviet Union for the foreseeable
                    future.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: It was not on our horizon.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we turn to Yugoslavia, did you find much interest in sort of the
                    academic world or artistic world in the United States in Bulgaria? I mean was
                    this someplace where one had to really go out and say, “Gee, fellows, you really
                    have to go to Bulgaria.”</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: There was not a great deal of interest. Yugoslavia was different as we
                    both know. It was kind of unique. They had made the break. You could travel
                    there relatively freely. Bulgaria, Romania, these countries, were seen as being
                    very close to the Soviet Union and less interesting. I think in terms of
                    culture, in terms of a common sense of values, people tended to think that
                    Hungary and Czechoslovakia, at the time, were more Western and there was more
                    interest in going to Prague or Budapest. I think that these were sort of on the
                    fringe, though not as far on the fringe as Albania.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Q: Well the cities were more interesting; they were really historic. All I can

                        going?What was doing then at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: There the effort was to move out into what are today the independent
                    republics. While I was in Zagreb serving in the Croatian republic of the Federal
                    Republic of Yugoslavia at the time, we opened a U.S. cultural center in
                    Ljubljana in Slovenia. It was kind of putting our mark into the various
                    republics of Yugoslavia recognizing them to that extent, never thinking in terms
                    of '92 in the Soviet Union or '92 in Yugoslavia, that we were going to be
                    dealing with independent republics. We wanted to establish our presence there,
                    to deal with Slovenia, to recognize Slovenia to that extent.</p>
                <p>When I came back to Washington as the Yugoslav desk officer at USIA, we were
                    working to open cultural centers, and did, in Sarajevo in Bosnia, and in
                    Titograd (now Podgorica) in Montenegro. These were very small operations. They
                    were not consular operations because the Yugoslavs were not having any of this.
                    We actually had to negotiate these deals very carefully. The people who went
                    there did not travel on diplomatic passports. They were not accredited to
                    Yugoslavia as diplomats. They were information officers, or librarians, or
                    cultural affairs officers and they went with official passports, which gave them
                    a certain amount of protection.</p>
                <p>This was an era when we were negotiating with the Yugoslavs to see how far we
                    could push the envelope to be represented throughout the country of Yugoslavia.
                    We did so successfully, although we wanted our people to be recognized as
                    diplomats. We always wanted more and the Yugoslavs tended to want less, but we
                    did it.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>The opening in Ljubljana, which I attended, was a tremendous success. We had a
                    lot of dignitaries show up, as well as a lot of artistic, academic, and
                    intellectual people. I was back in the States at the time when we opened in
                    Sarajevo, but we were very careful on who we would choose. We chose someone,
                    Victor Jackovitch, who subsequently became our first ambassador into Bosnia. He
                    was the first to open up the cultural center in Sarajevo. I can't remember who
                    went to Titograd at this time.</p>
                <p>Q: Despite you having to be rather precise in moderating what we were opening in
                    Montenegro, Bosnia, and Slovenia, did you find that cultural wise and all, the
                    Yugoslav government was pretty open to what we could do there?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes, especially with the hindsight gained after having gone and served
                    in the Soviet Union. It was tremendously open. I don't think we realized how
                    open it was at that time. But even having come to Yugoslavia and having served
                    there, and then serving on the desk, looking back at Venezuela, which was my
                    only previous Foreign Service assignment, we were limited in certain ways. There
                    were student protests about Vietnam in Venezuela, but, as I mentioned to you, I
                    managed to get the political counselor at the embassy to go onto campus and give
                    a talk about Vietnam. That was pretty sensitive and there were a lot of doubts
                    about that. I think Yugoslavia at the time, at least culturally and
                    intellectually, was quite open. Politically, it was another matter. They simply
                    were not going to recognize us putting diplomats into the various republics
                    beyond where we had an established consulate (i.e., Zagreb).</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find going on the desk, having served in Zagreb, were you getting a
                    taste of the two outlooks between Zagreb consulate general in Croatia, and then
                    sort of the Serbian outlook from our embassy and information office in Belgrade?
                    Sitting back in Washington, did you get a feel for almost two different real
                    perspectives of how they treated it, or did it reflect itself?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Certainly, but I think I had a feel for it when we were in Zagreb,
                    along with the rest of those who were serving in the consulate there. We
                    traveled to Belgrade a lot. It is not that we didn't get down frequently to
                    Belgrade and consult with the embassy. We got down there much more than Belgrade
                    came to us, but I suppose that is like Mohammed going to the mountain.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>When I came back here, it was my first assignment in Washington. Working on the
                    desk I was representing not only Yugoslavia but a couple of other countries as
                    well. I worked extremely closely with the State Department; there were very
                    close ties. There were very good people on the desk; Harry Gilmore and others at
                    the time. I also worked with the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency, and
                    others, but mainly with the State Department. I began to see a bigger picture
                    than I had in Zagreb. My perception now is that the differences were less than
                    we perceived from Zagreb when we were thinking that they don't pay enough
                    attention to us; we are a very important piece of the action here; Belgrade is
                    ethnocentric and thinking only in terms of Serbian relations with the United
                    States. I think a broader perspective developed as I came back to the desk. I
                    began to see a bigger picture not only within Yugoslavia itself, but in how
                    Yugoslavia fit into the overall relationships that we were having with the
                    Soviet Union and with other countries in Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major developments that you can think of on
                        youdesk issues or anything that came up in the '72 to '74 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: There were no big issues. What we did was to try to negotiate, and
                    successfully, a cultural agreement with Bulgaria, and Albania, both. The Voice
                    of American was an issue with Bulgaria. We would periodically find ourselves
                    jammed. This was not a huge issue, but it was a recurring one. If the Bulgarians
                    got the sense that we had pushed the envelope too far, interviewed a Bulgarian
                    dissident in the States, or talked about a particular incident in U.S.-Bulgarian
                    relations that they felt went over the line in what they wanted to hear, they
                    would start the jamming just as the Soviet Union was doing throughout the time.
                    This happened maybe four times in the two year that I was on the desk, but then
                    negotiations would get underway. “Why are you jamming?” “We are not jamming.”
                    “We have evidence that you are jamming. Here is the evidence.” We would go back
                    and forth like that. Those were some of the difficult issues that came up.
                    Otherwise, we continued to work towards cultural agreements and expanding the
                    kinds of relationships and exchanges that we had with the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in '74 you took Russian training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a spur of the moment thing that you did or had
                        you beeplanning to do this? How did it come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I think when I talked back in Venezuela about wanting to go and serve
                    in the communist world, to know what it was all about, I had in mind Moscow. I
                    think all of us did. It was kind of going to the mother church in a sense. We
                    tremendously enjoyed Yugoslavia and I thought if this is what serving in a
                    communist country is all about, bring on Moscow. No problems. Not while in
                    Yugoslavia, but certainly while I was on the desk and talking to the powers that
                    be, I started working on it. The press attach�/information officer slot was
                    coming open in Moscow and I thought that would be, and it turned out to be, a
                    tremendously interesting situation. I went into language training at the Foreign
                    Service Institute and nine months later went out to Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the language training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Difficult. I had known Serbo-Croatian. I certainly wouldn't consider
                    myself fluent in Serbo-Croatian but I had worked well enough after
                    two-and-a-half years in Zagreb, and I thought Russian would be a piece of cake,
                    another Slavic language. Sure enough, I found that initially, I would say maybe
                    the first three months, it was a piece of cake. It was quite easy. Then the
                    differences started to come in.</p>
                <p>Two things were supposed to happen that didn't happen. Actually, I was not
                    supposed to go to Moscow until '76. At that time, as you may recall, they were
                    sending many people to Garmisch to a Russian language institute. I was looking
                    forward to going to Garmisch very much. Secondly, for that additional intensive
                    language studies with Russian �migr�s who were teaching there, it turned out
                    that the person who was going to Moscow, for some reason couldn't go. My
                    predecessor was extended in Moscow for one year and my departure date was moved
                    up for one year, so I went off with less than half the Russian language
                    training. At the end of my two years in Moscow I felt comfortable in Russian but
                    I really felt that the Serbo-Croatian kept mixing me up.</p>
                <p>Q: I took Russian early on and I remember ending up in Kyrgyzstan where I found
                    myself absolutely tongue tied because I didn't know whether I was speaking
                    Serbian or Russian.</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Right.</p>
                <p>Q: Trying to sort out, and when you start doing that you are dead. You served in
                    Moscow from when to when?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: From '75 to '77.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your job was what?</hi>

                <p>CALLAWAY: It was press attach� and information officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whom did you replace?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Eli Flam. I don't know if you've talked with him or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: He's an interesting fellow and he's in the area. He livedown in Port
                    Tobacco which is not too far from here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to get a hold of him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: He's good. He came back and served on the VOA desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived in Moscow, how would you describe the
                        state orelations between the United States and Moscow at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: This was the great detente era in which Kissinger and Nixon, or at the
                    time I guess it would have been Ford, were still trying to pull that out. They
                    were under a great deal of criticism both from the right and the left; you're
                    not going far enough; you're going too far; this will never work; this is a
                    cynical game you are playing.</p>
                <p>I was there for the last Kissinger trip to Moscow which was quite interesting. It
                    was one of those flukes that happens, but the public affairs officer, the
                    counselor for public affairs in the embassy, happened to be out of the country
                    for medical reasons, if I recall correctly. Suddenly I was the acting public
                    affairs officer dealing with the spokesman for the State Department, setting up
                    press conferences, and negotiating with the Russians about how much access was
                    allowed, how many journalists could come in to the room, and how long they could
                    stay there. It was a tremendous experience but also kind of frightening to
                    suddenly get thrust into that.</p>
                <p>This was sort of the farewell visit of Kissinger. He was someone that the Soviets
                    had, I think, grown, in a begrudging kind of way to, trust is too strong a word,
                    but sort of know where he was coming from. I think it was a nostalgic visit for
                    both Kissinger and his team, and for the Soviets who knew they were meeting with
                    him for the last time.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>I think it was very uncertain about what a Jimmy Carter regime, as they quickly
                    found out, was going to mean as we moved into human rights. CSCE (today OSCE)
                    had been signed in Helsinki during that period of time and although it was
                    signed under Ford they knew that it was going to be implemented and carried out
                    under Carter who talked an awful lot about human rights and meant what he said.
                    It was an uneasy period.</p>
                <p>I have another funny story. We were meeting late one night in the Kremlin with
                    Kissinger and his team. It was just a very small group of people and there were
                    maybe five at most U.S. journalists who were there. They were meeting in a small
                    room and, as I say, it was very late at night. We had no idea how long this was
                    going to go on and I had to relieve myself. One of the guards walked me down
                    this hall and said, “Here's the men's room.” I came out fully expecting to find
                    the guard and there was nobody there. There was nobody in sight and I had no
                    idea where I was. Here I am in the middle of the night wandering around the
                    Kremlin. I couldn't believe it. I finally made my way back to the talks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about when you got there, what did you do as press
                        attach�?What type of work were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: The relationships were with both the resident foreign press and the
                    local press. The foreign press was mainly U.S. There were about 25 foreign
                    correspondents there at the time. The New York Times had a two person bureau.
                    All the networks, CBS, NBC, ABC, were represented as were CNN, Washington Post,
                    all the major media. To a lesser degree we worked with Reuters, Agence France
                    Press, and others because we had more clout with the Foreign Ministry and that
                    is who we really dealt with.</p>
                <p>The foreign correspondents were accredited almost in the same ritual that the
                    diplomats were accredited. There was very strict examination of their
                    backgrounds. Their credentials were issued and they simply couldn't do any more
                    travel, which was quite restricted in the Soviet Union, than we could without
                    permission or without escorts. We represented in many ways the interests of the
                    foreign press based in Moscow. We did it on a rather regular basis because they
                    were always getting in trouble since, naturally, journalists were trying to push
                    as far as they could.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>I was there when Bob Toth of The L.A. Times was arrested and thrown into the KGB
                    prison. It was scary as hell not only for him and his family but for all of us
                    because this was going further than normal. They would scare them, harass them,
                    smash their windshields, and puncture their tires, but rarely would they throw
                    them into prison and keep them there. He had been caught in a setup, in a sting
                    operation. All the journalists, of course, met with dissidents and they tried to
                    do it as discretely as possible. This particular dissident with whom Toth
                    established a relationship had been obviously coerced in one way or another by
                    the KGB. He met Bob and was going to pass him some information when the KGB came
                    and swooped down on both of them. There were some “allegedly” military papers in
                    what he was passing over to him. He was accused of being a spy and thrown into
                    prison.</p>
                <p>After several days of pretty tough negotiations with them in which not only I,
                    but right up to and including the ambassador were involved, we got him out of
                    prison on the basis that I take him directly from prison and escort him straight
                    out to the airport. TASS tried to interview him at the airport. They said, “It
                    wasn't so bad, was it? Don't you want to confess that you really did it?” Toth
                    kind of turned to me and said, “I don't say anything until I am out of here. Why
                    don't you say something?” I said, “You accuse this guy falsely. You set him up.”
                    I sort of blasted them and put him on a plane.</p>
                <p>The other thing we were supposed to do, as we did in so-called normal countries
                    with which we had a normal relationship, was to establish relationships with the
                    Soviet press, the Soviet media. I did that to the best extent possible. We would
                    try to place U.S. programs on Soviet television. When we had people like
                    Kissinger in town, we would set up interviews with him. With Pravda, with
                    Izvestia, Komsomolskaya Pravda, with the other papers, we tried to have as close
                    as what we considered normal kind of relations as we could with placement
                    interviews, that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Another funny story. The foreign editor of Pravda was someone that I had
                    established what I thought to be a bit more than the normal relationship. As I
                    was leaving after two years there, I took my successor to call on him at Pravda.
                    There had been a nasty piece in Pravda that day attacking us for something so I
                    used the occasion to say that we thought that was pushing a little far, that it
                    was nasty, inaccurate; why don't we try to work out things a little bit better
                    with my successor here. I never knew how to take this, whether I felt I had
                    really established a relationship and he was telling me something that he
                    wouldn't have told everybody, or whether it meant that the relationship was
                    strictly as formal and precise as the Soviets would want, but he turned to me
                    and said, “Friend Callaway, do you see those file cabinets over there? The ones
                    on the left are favorable stories about the United States and the ones on the
                    right are unfavorable stories. I do what I am told.” I thought it was an
                    interesting revelation, but also it just shows you that there were always limits
                    in how far we could carry the relationship.</p>

                <p>CALLAWAY: Not personally, although it happened to people that I was traveling
                    with on a number of occasions. One of the great things about being press attach�
                    is that when various people would come to town I would travel with them. A group
                    of the ACYPL, American Council of Young Political Leaders, and a group of
                    journalists came to the Soviet Union on an exchange program and we traveled out
                    into Siberia on a couple of occasions. Apollo-Soyuz took place while we were
                    there. That was a big event.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a joint space...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: A joint space adventure when the Apollo and the Soyuz, the two space
                    capsules, for the first time went up and joined together. The Soviet cosmonauts
                    traveled to the States and did a goodwill tour, and the astronauts came to the
                    Soviet Union and we traveled around.</p>
                <p>Another occasion that I remember in which we were both quite frightened, was when
                    I escorted a VOA monitor through the Soviet Union to several cities. What he was
                    doing was trying to see how the signal was being received, very innocently. He
                    said exactly who he was and what he was doing. We were shadowed throughout the
                    entire trip. A Soviet team of radio people would go into the hotel right next to
                    us and as soon as he would set up his equipment and try to monitor it, they
                    would start to jam it. We were followed on the streets. It wasn't direct
                    harassment like what happened to Toth, for example, or another friend of mine
                    who worked for U.S. News and World Reports who was given a mikky, in effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about a mikky, in other words a
                        pill...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes, something was put in his drink and then they accused him of being
                    drunk and disturbing the peace, and they threw him in jail for a while. Our
                    harassment was what happened to normal people. You would be stopped on the road
                    and they would ask you where your papers where. They would hold you up knowing
                    you had an appointment in the next town when you were traveling. It was that
                    sort of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Traveling with these groups, particularly going out to Siberia, was probably the
                    most fascinating way to get away from what could become rather restricted and
                    humdrum activities of dealing with the Soviets in the capital. People would find
                    it odd that I said I really enjoyed traveling in Siberia, which I did on a
                    couple of occasions. It reminded me of the attitude we see here when you go to
                    Kansas or Nebraska or wherever, and ask them what they think of Washington.
                    These people thought that they were on the frontier, they were building
                    socialism out there, and those old fuddy duddy bureaucrats in Moscow had lost
                    the vision long ago. We would have these really frank discussions between
                    ourselves and young Communist Party leaders out in the provinces, in Ust-Ulimsk,
                    which is way out on Lake Baikal where a big dam project was going on, and where
                    a new railroad was being built. These experiences were when you got the feeling
                    that there was not this monolithic attitude that the Soviets tried to project
                    out of Moscow. It was refreshing and it was quite interesting.</p>
                <p>With the astronaut travel, of course, they were trying to impress us. They took
                    us to places where we had not been before, to the Soviet space program, and so
                    on. The astronauts were not impressed. It was quite interesting to see them say,
                    “My god, if we had seen what we see here on the ground we might never have
                    linked up with them in space.”</p>
                <p>Q: That brings up something. You had served in Yugoslavia and all and now you are
                    in the Soviet Union. Can you do a little compare and contrast with what you saw
                    in the Soviet Union, both in Moscow and in your travels around, and compare it
                    to what you had seen before and what you expected to see?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I think what I expected to see was based on our own experiences in
                    Yugoslavia. Communism to me, before ever going to a communist state, tended to
                    be sort of a monolithic perception. I went to Yugoslavia and this was not what I
                    expected. This was quite a pleasant place to me. There were many objections that
                    we had to the centralized control, to the control of the economy, and so on, but
                    they were moving in the right direction.</p>
                <p>I think I went to the Soviet Union after that experience having swung too far the
                    other way and expected that this may not be exactly like Yugoslavia, but moving
                    in that direction. I think the story I mentioned about the Pravda foreign
                    affairs editor is an example of how the Soviets were very much in control. If
                    things were getting better in the way they wanted, in terms of better trade or
                    economic relations particularly with the United States, or respected borders
                    which is the main thing that the Soviet Union wanted out of the CSCE agreements
                    in Helsinki... We wanted more freedom of information. We were looking at what
                    was at that time called basket three, that's the area we wanted. The Soviets
                    wanted recognition of existing borders and by that they extended it not only to
                    the existing states in Eastern Europe and sphere of influence, but also to the
                    Baltic States which we had never recognized as being incorporated into the
                    Soviet Union. As long as things were going their way I think that they would
                    allow us to do more opening up for information and cultural programs; which we
                    thought would eventually - and I think it eventually did in some ways -
                    undermine the Soviet system.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>The travel restrictions were very odious to me. You will recall we could travel
                    around Yugoslavia quite freely. In Russia, you couldn't go to Zagorst outside of
                    Moscow, which was a big monastery complex where the Russian Orthodox Church had
                    their headquarters. It was a fascinating place to visit, but you had to get
                    permission to travel outside the ring road of Moscow, which was about 25 miles.
                    The Soviets were very clever; they would never say no. They just wouldn't say
                    yes. It reminded me of later in Nicaragua under the Sandinistas where I applied
                    for two solid years to travel to the Caribbean coast and they never said no,
                    they just never said yes, so you weren't allowed to go.</p>
                <p>You always knew that things were being monitored. I'm not sure, they probably
                    were to a certain degree in Yugoslavia, your telephone conversations, your
                    apartments were bugged, and so on. You knew that was the case in Moscow and you
                    were not allowed to have any freedom about where you lived. We went from one
                    building to another in the two years that we lived in Moscow. There were no
                    Soviet citizens whatsoever living in those buildings; they were all foreigners.
                    We had three young children at the time and one thing that we would do was go
                    down to the playground after work or go and stand in a line to buy milk. With
                    little children standing in line, you could have a conversation; otherwise, as I
                    mentioned earlier, people would shy away from you for fear of their own jobs, or
                    security. We would look for opportunities like this in order to have a normal
                    conversation with a Russian citizen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your wife react to the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: She disliked it the most of any assignment. I had a job to go to, a
                    place to go to every day, and exciting things like traveling out to Siberia and
                    going with the astronauts. She taught in the university when we were in
                    Venezuela when we didn't have children. In Zagreb, we only had one child and by
                    now we had three. It was a rough life. Buying food, even though there were the
                    Berioska shops, places where foreigners could buy food, still it was quite
                    restricted in what you could buy and it took an awful lot of time. We had a
                    part-time maid who, after we had come to know her a little bit, informed my wife
                    that she didn't know what she had done wrong but we were far below her rank in
                    the KGB and why she had been assigned to somebody so low-ranking, she just
                    couldn't understand. That kind of thing after thinking she had established a
                    relationship with this woman and suddenly being told that we were beneath her
                    was too much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Soviet Union as a country? I mean, where
                        iranked in development and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: One of the attitudes that I had about the travel restrictions within
                    the Soviet Union is that they weren't necessarily trying to hide always. In some
                    cases, it was certainly the case like military establishments or concentration
                    camps, which there certainly were. They were also trying to hide from foreigners
                    the tremendous lack of development in that country. You got outside of the major
                    cities - Leningrad, Moscow, Kiev - at the time, and from what little we could
                    observe, it was a pretty primitive country. It really hadn't developed very much
                    and that was one reason people wanted to move to Moscow. They were very
                    restricted in moving to the big cities. Personal movement for Soviet citizens
                    was more restricted than we were. They couldn't just pick up and say, “I want to
                    get a job in the big city.” Everybody wanted to come to the big city because
                    life was better. If you got out to the countryside, it was quite primitive and I
                    think the Soviets were trying to cover that up. It was a very backward country
                    and you see that more and more now. With hindsight, we looked at their military
                    establishment or their space program and thought, my god, these people are our
                    rivals. Khrushchev was saying “We will bury you.” No way, as we now see.</p>
                <p>Q: During this time, as you were sitting there watching the campaign between Ford
                    and Carter develop, was there disquiet in the embassy because of Carter trying
                    to look for a different way to deal with the Soviets or at least it seemed like
                    it, or not?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I can remember - and this was long before either of us were probably in
                    the Foreign Service - when Stalin died and the United States was uneasy. What
                    are we going to do? Are things going to get worse? At least we knew this devil.
                    I think, to a degree, the Soviets sort of projected that same uncertainty. How
                    are we going to deal with this guy (Carter)? We know what we are doing with the
                    Nixons, Fords, and Kissingers of this world but this guy is a wild card. I think
                    that regardless about how you may have felt about your own personal politics -
                    and I would have tended to be more of a Democrat than a Republican - I think in
                    terms of U.S.-Soviet relations, there was a bit of a concern, what's it going to
                    mean? It turned out that things got tough because the Soviets reacted strongly
                    to Carter pushing in the human rights area. And then there was Afghanistan, of
                    course.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes. It is reminiscent in some ways of the way we arlooking at Yeltsin
                    today; is he going to make it through another day?</p>
                <p>Q: I have to say that it seems like for the last 20 years we've been looking at
                    the health of Soviet leaders and a good part of the time they seem to be on
                    their last legs and not really terribly responsive.</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Right. Andropov was more ill than I think we realized hwas. It's scary
                    isn't it?</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is scary. Who was our ambassador while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: There were two and they were very different in personalities and
                    attitudes towards the Soviets. Walter Stoessel, who is now deceased, was the
                    ambassador when I went there. Stoessel was a very gentle man. That is the best
                    way to describe his personality and that's the way he dealt with the Soviets. It
                    was very low key. He tried to be as rational as he could. Of course, he stood up
                    on issues of principal, but it was a very cooperative attitude. He was replaced
                    by Mac Toon, who had served in Yugoslavia and who had a very different attitude
                    towards the Soviets. He was a tough guy. “I'm going to tell them the way it
                    is.”Every week, unless there was something going on, the ambassador would give a
                    background briefing to the American press corps, plus Reuters who were
                    considered as honorary Americans for this occasion. Agence France Press and
                    Deutsche Welle and others were very irate about this because everybody knew that
                    it went on. He would give a background briefing for the press right in the
                    embassy, for the American media representatives. Stoessel and Matlock, who was
                    the DCM at the time, would give rather factual information, and I would say they
                    tried to accentuate the positive. Toon came in and his first briefing he said,
                    “It is going to be a different ball game here guys.” We were talking about
                    negotiating either SALT or some treaty with the Soviets, and one of the
                    correspondents asked him, “Doesn't it have to come at a certain point to a
                    matter of trust?” He slammed his fist on the table and said, “Trust? Hell I
                    don't trust the British!” He sort of put his stamp on it. They were very
                    different personalities and had different ways of viewing things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get sort of between these two ambassadors and the
                        presat all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: The two ambassadors were very capable. They both came with a lot more
                    expertise and experience in the Soviet Union than I had. I was the press
                    spokesman for the embassy so normally I would issue the statements in the name
                    of the ambassador and in the name of the embassy, or do an interview, unless it
                    became something where they had to have the ambassador on the issue.</p>
                <p>There was one issue that I felt extremely uncomfortable with to the point where I
                    suppose I tended to jeopardize my career. I felt so uncomfortable with it that I
                    went to the public affairs counselor, my immediate boss, and said, “I just don't
                    feel comfortable in being the spokesman on this issue.” The issue was the very
                    sensitive one of radiation of the embassy. We had it pretty well documented that
                    the Soviets were microwaving the embassy and the reason was uncertain. Were they
                    trying to pick up signals from our communications facilities? Were they actively
                    trying to irradiate us? The controls within the embassy about who could talk
                    about it and what they could say about it were very, very rigid.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying Matlock was very tough.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: He was very tough and this was the word, “If you can't handle it as a
                    Foreign Service officer then maybe you are not serving in the right place, at
                    the right time.” I went to talk to the Ambassador Stoessel. Stoessel was much
                    more gentle in his explanation. “This is a highly sensitive subject. It is being
                    worked at the highest levels. This is the word we have from Kissinger. This is
                    what we have to do, Gil.” It was much more comforting to me to hear that
                    explanation than this sort of, tough it out, but I still was very uncomfortable
                    with what we were saying. I didn't think we were giving the whole story. I felt
                    that possibly people's lives and health were in jeopardy, and I though we ought
                    to be more forthcoming. I went to the public affairs officer and said, “I can't
                    do this any more.” He was very good. This was Ray Benson.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Right. It was Ray and Ray said, “Okay, I'll take it ufor you,” on this
                    particular issue.</p>
                <p>Q: This is a matter of trust which has come up from time to time and that is
                    there is a feeling by people who served in Moscow that for geo-political reasons
                    Henry Kissinger was quite willing to sell his team down the river as far as
                    dangers. I mean things were happening like this radiation and it may be a very
                    sensitive issue, but it really wasn't very sensitive. It was a very
                    straightforward issue: what the hell are you doing? Maybe it had something to do
                    with electronic eavesdropping on both sides or something but the fact was that
                    it is still not quite clear what this was all about.</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: No, I don't think it is clear to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that there would have been a great

                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: There was a great deal of unease.</p>
                <p>Q: I mean our leaders, and not just the embassy, but Kissinger and his company;
                    is he supporting his staff? If there is a doubt you have to err on the side of
                    health but that didn't seem to fit within his purview.</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Subsequently, and they had Johns Hopkins Medical School da study...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I know. I mean all of us who served in Yugoslavia

                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: What happened was that the Hopkins study said that they had interviewed
                    everybody who had served in Moscow between certain periods of time. I was
                    interviewed. You were probably interviewed. I knew people who weren't though.
                    Therefore, I knew that either Hopkins believed they had interviewed everybody or
                    they had been told to skew the results. It may have been a minor thing, but it
                    could have been the surface of the iceberg. Knowing that sort of thing leads you
                    to question other things when other things may not have been in question.
                    Knowing that we were making misleading statements with the imprimatur of Johns
                    Hopkins Medical School.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes. It was an uneasy time. Families were briefed and they would call
                    them in periodically because, of course, you are concerned about your wives,
                    your children. I can recall my wife, being the wife of the press attach�, said,
                    “I just think that this is unconscionable that we can't get this word out.” She
                    talked to the wife of another embassy official who said, “By damn, I don't care
                    if this ruins my husband's career and we get shipped out of here tomorrow. I
                    understand why you're not doing it because your husband's the press attach� and
                    he's the first one they would point their finger at, but I am going to the
                    Washington Post and the New York Times and telling them everything they told
                    me,” although they had been sworn to say nothing. She said, “To hell with them.
                    I'm going to go tell it all.” So the word did get out. It was a disturbing
                    time.</p>

                <p>CALLAWAY: Not to my knowledge, the various stories, as you say, the questions of
                    why they were doing it and who was doing what to whom? It was being done. I
                    don't think there is any question about that. I think the whole question of the
                    health issue is debatable to this day.</p>

                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Not in the Soviet Union, we did not. We had the first Cyrus Vance visit
                    which was absolutely fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about that because this was a very
                        important one. This would have been in early '77. He came as one of his
                        first things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes, it was pretty early.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: They came and the Carter administration was determined to move ahead on
                    the arms limitation talks. I think that they were going to show that they were
                    going to be able to push this. They were in now and they were for peace,
                    cooperation, and so on. This new team came in headed by Vance with
                    representatives from the National Security Council, the Department of Defense,
                    and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It was a fairly large team.</p>
                <p>My recollection is that the ambassador pointed out to the team that there were
                    certain aspects of the proposed agreement that were going to be very, very
                    difficult, if not absolutely impossible, to get accepted by the Soviets. The
                    attitude of the team - and I'm not going to speak for the whole team - that was
                    conveyed to me was that they had been through absolute hell on negotiating this
                    before they ever left Washington between the CIA, Department of Defense, the
                    Energy agency, the NSC, and various factions. They had been through so much,
                    negotiated so much among themselves, and arrived at this, that they couldn't
                    imagine that the Soviets wouldn't accept it.</p>
                <p>Toon was absolutely right. The Soviets didn't accept it. They rejected certain
                    sections of it totally out of hand. In the parlance of the deal, as we deal in
                    diplomacy, there was no fallback position so we kind of gathered up in some
                    befuddlement our papers and the team went home. It was a setback rather than an
                    advance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Essentially Vance came back very obviously with egg on his
                        face. CALLAWAY: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Q: Did you find the press that came with him and the corps that was there, was
                    this apparent at the time that this wasn't going anywhere. During the time were
                    you trying to put the best face on it and all of that?</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: One of the things that made a great deal of difficulty for me in my
                    relationships with the resident American correspondents there was that Kissinger
                    and Sonnenfeldt very carefully controlled access. They did a couple of press
                    briefings while they were there, but they also did background briefings and they
                    restricted those background briefings to the traveling five, eight, 10
                    journalists. I don't remember exactly what the numbers were. This became known,
                    particularly when you had some major organizations who for one reason or another
                    were not represented in the traveling press. You are seeing reports back home
                    reflecting things that were not in the public briefings. People knew what was
                    going on; it was not that much of a secret. I tried my damnedest to convince
                    Sonnenfeldt and Kissinger that they had to include at least a representative
                    sampling, particularly from those major organizations that weren't represented,
                    but I was not successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were talking about Kissinger-Sonnenfeldt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes. I'm sorry, we were talking about the Vance visit. Yes, we're
                    talking about when Vance came the first time Hodding Carter was spokesman. They
                    were much more open. Forgive me for slipping between the two.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But anyway that reflected the Kissinger time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: It was much more open and that was also part of the Carter
                    administration's policy; they were not going to have this kind of restriction.
                    At the time, I was thinking it was sort of a reaction to CSCE and how we were
                    going to handle the Helsinki accords. My recollection from 20-plus years ago was
                    that Carter was pretty open. They came here, thought they had a good deal,
                    thought they offered the Soviets a good deal, but they didn't accept it.
                    Obviously, they were trying to put the best face on it, even to the extent of
                    saying we negotiated this very heavily in Washington and tried to represent the
                    various interests, and we thought that we were offering the Soviets a good deal.
                    There were a lot of tough questions like, don't you have a fallback
                    position?</p>
                <p>It was a very different atmosphere. We even got, in a couple of instances, access
                    for more non-U.S. representatives of the press corps. Agence France Press and
                    others were invited in. I think they were being very open while trying to put
                    the best face on their disappointment and their chagrin at not being about to
                    pull something off.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Q: Just as sort of a footnote to the oral histories here, I think this is
                    something I've noticed again and again, and that is that the Washington
                    operators, again including Foreign Service types and all, tend to feel that if
                    they've got Congress on their side, Treasury on their side, they've got a pretty
                    good hook with the media and the public and all. If they negotiate it, then
                    obviously these stupid foreigners have to agree with what we've come up with
                    because we've done this. They seem to lose sight of the fact that negotiations
                    on our side, and the Pentagon of course, is just one part of the equation and
                    you had better start talking to your experts. I think the hot shot operators in
                    Washington sort of brush aside the other country's experts because they are sort
                    of nay sayers.</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes. I think we see it now with Kosovo. There was almost a mind set in
                    terms of Milosevic being the devil who is driving this thing, but he is a big
                    bully and will cave if we punch him in the nose, and not looking at the other
                    things that could happen. I am certainly paraphrasing this, it is not an exact
                    quote, but I remember one member of the team said, “We've been through hell in
                    Washington. The Soviets will be a piece of cake.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you left in '77, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I had applied to study in Germany, East-West relations, and a couple of
                    other places. I ended up going to Johns Hopkins Bologna Center in Italy. I did a
                    year of studies at the advanced level there at the Center of European Studies of
                    Johns Hopkins SAIS in Bologna.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From '77 to '78?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you looking at?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I did a study of the relationships between the United States and the
                    Communist Party of Italy, as a reflection of U.S.-Soviet relationships. I drew
                    the parallels and decided that there wasn't very much the PCI, the Communist
                    Party of Italy, could do compared to how our relationships with the Soviet Union
                    were going. We were either more lenient, or favorable, or accommodating towards
                    our dealings with the Communist Party of Italy and thinking they were more
                    Eurocommunist (Eurocommunist was the term of the day at that time) or less
                    Stalinist, and more socialistic, depending on how our relations with the Soviet
                    Union were going. I did some timelines and some relationships about what was
                    happening with U.S.-Soviet relations at the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>We were tougher on the PCI if relations were bad and if relationships were better
                    then we were more lenient. That was sort of saying that we dealt in terms of our
                    big power relationships, not only with the East European countries, but also
                    with large communist parties in France and Italy. The Communist Party of Italy
                    was a huge and influential organization which is now splintered in many ways.
                    Bologna had been a communist-controlled city since right after the war. It was
                    right in the middle of the red belt. I got to talk to the mayor and other
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you talk to Berlinguer or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I never got to talk to Berlinguer. I saw him at rallies.</p>
                <p>Q: Just yesterday I was interviewing Allan Holmes who was our DCM during this
                    time that you are talking about in Rome and he was talking about how we were
                    very concerned about Euro-communism, but it was not our policy to feel that this
                    was a benign influence and we should be very concerned about it.</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Right.</p>
                <p>Q: Although the Italian communist party was not the Stalinist one of the French,
                    still we didn't want to have this historic compromise. Did you find that dealing
                    with our officials there, that you could see a very firm line drawn?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: My feeling is that our embassy and its officials were much more open to
                    this than Washington and tried to say, we can go further, not all the way, not
                    too far, but we can go further than the guidelines that were coming out of
                    Washington were permitting us to do. I may be inaccurate in my assumptions, but
                    that was the feeling I had. There was more of an effort if you are on the ground
                    to deal with these people - we are here; we know them better; we know where to
                    draw the line - than the people back in Washington who are setting a more
                    general global policy.</p>

                    impaired consul general. He was a fascinating fellow.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Q: According to Allan Holmes he was someone who really looked at this with a much
                    more balanced view. His analyses were really taken very seriously.</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk a little about the Bologna Center, the site?
                        Whwere the students there? What was the atmosphere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: It was a tremendous atmosphere. There were only about 100 or so
                    students, as I recall. They were all graduate students. They were all enrolled
                    in the School of Advanced International Studies, SAIS. About half of them were
                    Americans and about half of them were from everywhere else. They were mostly
                    European, of course, Germans and French. Some were from the East. There were
                    some Yugoslav students and professors there. There was one East German professor
                    who taught a course on Marxism which was absolutely fascinating to hear from
                    that perspective. Then there were some from the Far East. It was a real mixed
                    bag of people who were very interested in public policy, who were going to go
                    into either their governments or their foreign services, or international
                    aspects of businesses in their various countries.</p>
                <p>It was a tremendous experience. Dealing with the students and professors there
                    was as exciting as the academic part of the courses although with the kind of
                    study that I was doing, and most of the other students were doing, it was not
                    very book oriented. It was very practical. You are in Bologna. Take advantage of
                    it. You can travel to Milan, Florence, Geneva, very easily. Of course, it was a
                    wonderful part of the world to live in and eat in for a while so a lot of us did
                    a lot of weekend traveling. The University of Bologna was very heavily
                    influenced by leftists at the time, and SAIS had a close relationship. Many of
                    the professors came over. As a matter of fact, I had Romano Prodi, the recently
                    departed prime minister of Italy and now the head ofthe European Commission, as
                    a professor of economics from the University of Bologna.</p>
                <p>It was quite an interesting time. The fall before I arrived there, there had been
                    student riots in Italy, in Bologna, similar to the '68 days. The atmosphere as
                    the school year opened was very uneasy and tense in the city. There were some
                    demonstrations in which I went out as a student and sort of mingled with the
                    students. I talked to the students and asked, “Why are you here? What do you
                    think about this?” Having the mantle of a student coming over from Johns
                    Hopkins, it was very easy to do and gave me a lot of real insights. It was sort
                    of like being in a consulate for a year, like in Zagreb, and you could see the
                    relationships and how Bologna and Emilia-Romagna, the regional province there,
                    viewed Italy, which is a very varied country, as you know.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>They were in the northern and industrialized part. You get into the Florence area
                    and it is a very central region. Rome is seen as a bunch of government
                    bureaucrats, worthless. And then there is the south. The north, or certainly
                    Bologna and Milan, views them as a bunch of freeloaders; “we are supporting this
                    country.” It was a very good lead-in to my subsequent assignment in the embassy
                    in Rome because I had not only a provincial, but a non-diplomatic status. I had
                    no diplomatic status in Bologna.</p>
                <p>It was absolutely fascinating getting into the bureaucracy of the country. I
                    think bureaucracy has to be an Italian word; they invented it. We had to go out
                    and find a place to live, register a car, get a driver's license, all of that,
                    the way Italians do it. Most of us when you go into a country never realize what
                    the embassy is doing for you. It was a relief in some ways to go down to the
                    embassy and say, “Get my drivers license.” We knew what it was like to deal with
                    the Italian bureaucracy, to deal with Italian politicians, to live in the red
                    belt of the country.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression, having come from the Soviet Union and being in
                    Yugoslavia and all, of Italian communism at that time before you got to
                    Rome?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I think that the thrust of my paper is that we were kind of short
                    sighted to let our relationships with a very important Western European
                    communist party be determined by our relationships with the Soviet Union. My
                    thesis was, this is what determines our relationships with the PCI and I think
                    it was a critical assessment, that we shouldn't do it. We should look more at
                    what the PCI is, listen more to what they are saying, and try at least on a
                    country to country basis, maybe not in an overall scheme, to deal with that
                    situation and deal with it as part of our relationships between the United
                    States and Italy, rather than between the United States and the Soviet Union.
                    The criteria that was flowing out to us from Washington was “Denounce this,
                    denounce that.” Berlinguer was very careful in how far he would go in “breaking”
                    with the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you feel at that time that maybe the Communist Party was one that people
                    were converted to or did they almost inherit it with their family or with their
                    job?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: We weren't that far away from the Second World War. We forget what
                    Italy went through in the Second World War. We tend to think of Italy as a
                    wonderful place to visit, with good food, and so on. We also tend to think of
                    them as allies, which they are, with NATO and the G-7. They are very strong
                    allies. We remember Mussolini vaguely, certainly not in the same way as Adolph
                    Hitler and the Nazis, and the Fascists in Italy. Italy is not as central to our
                    relationships today as Germany is, certainly not since the combined Germany of
                    East and West Germany. Therefore, I think the history of Italy, even the recent
                    history of Italy, slips away from us.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>The communists in Italy were an integral part of a partisan movement first
                    against the Fascist regime but then more importantly after Italy declared
                    armistice in '43. Italy was essentially divided between a German occupied north
                    and an Allied occupied south. The partisans were a variety of groups,
                    monarchists and others, but the Communist Party played a tremendous role and had
                    a good shot at forming the government with Togliatti after the end of the war in
                    Europe in '45. I think a lot of people consider them to be almost the saviors of
                    Italy. They saw themselves in partisan terms. The incremental leanings that
                    Italy made towards Marxism, and then there was a very important referendum about
                    Italy going back to a monarchy again...</p>

                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Put lots of money into that election, yes, we did. We forget, but the
                    United States and Great Britain split right down the middle over this issue. The
                    British wanted a monarchy back again. They had a monarchy. This was the empire.
                    “We will try to restore the world much like it was.” Roosevelt and later Truman
                    were very much opposed to this policy. There were breaks within the alliance.
                    The Cold War was heating up. Turkey and Greece were a more immediate concern to
                    us but certainly the Communist Party of Italy we saw as a subversive fifth
                    column going to undermine right up to the British Isles again by another
                    totalitarian regime. I think that the Communist Party of Italy had moved
                    considerably since then.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: In '78 they asked me what I wanted to do and I said, “How about another
                    year in Bologna?” When they stopped laughing, I went to Rome in the same
                    position that I had in Moscow. I was press attach�/information officer in
                    Rome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did this in Rome from when to when? CALLAWAY: From '78

                        with thpress and also the embassy at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I had come from being press attach�/information officer and you think
                    you know what you are doing, but it was a totally different situation. Of course
                    in Italy, here is one of our firmest allies. When I went the ambassador was a
                    Carter appointee by the name of Richard Gardner who just a year or so ago ended
                    up being Clinton's ambassador in Spain. I served with him in both countries. He
                    was replaced by Maxwell Rabb who was a Reagan appointee. Those were the two
                    political appointees. I had never dealt with a political appointee as an
                    ambassador before, so that was different. Even though there had been political
                    appointees in Moscow and Venezuela as well, I hit career ambassadors up until
                    that point in my career.</p>
                <p>The first thing I noticed was the difference in relationships with the resident
                    American media in Rome. There were probably just as many accredited full-time
                    correspondents, 25 or so, but there were many more stringers and freelancers.
                    Italy was a great place to live. The attitude was, “I work for this magazine and
                    I shovel shit at night; anything to live here in Rome, I will do it.” The other
                    difference was their attitude towards the embassy. At the embassy in Moscow, we
                    were the defender, the provider of information, very close personal friends. In
                    Rome, it was basically, “We don't need you; information is wide open; we can go
                    to anybody; we can interview anybody any time we want to.” It was a very
                    different relationship. It was not hostile, but just “we live in our own worlds,
                    we have our job to do, and we can do it.”</p>
                <p>Certainly during a presidential visit, of which there are always a multitude in a
                    place like Italy, then you do credentials and access, when the press conference
                    is going to be set up, who is going to get into the background briefings. That
                    is when you become very important to them. I certainly formed some person
                    friendships which have lasted as long out of Rome as they did out of Moscow, but
                    on a day to day basis, we were dealing in a more cooperative relationship with
                    the Italian media.</p>
                <p>This was a time when television in Italy was going from a state-run entity of
                    three television stations, RAI one, two, and three. They were controlled by RAI,
                    which is Radio Italia when it was only radio, before it became television.
                    Television by that time was very big. Television reflected, as did the state-run
                    radio, the political situation in Italy. RAI-1 was Christian Democrat, RAI-2 was
                    Socialist, and RAI-3 was Communist. It wasn't identified but everybody just
                    understood that those parties had access not only to the kinds of programming in
                    those three radio and television stations, but more importantly to the jobs.
                    They named the director. A party faithful was head of the news division, and so
                    on.</p>
                <p>We obviously dealt with those three stations very differently. RAI-1, which for
                    many years had been the only radio and television station, was the biggest, the
                    most influential, and the most watched, so we dealt with them the most. Also,
                    quite obviously, they were the easiest to deal with. They were the Christian
                    Democrats, and there was a long relationship between the U.S. government and the
                    Christian Democratic Party. We tried to deal with all of them, including RAI-3,
                    to the extent that we could, placing programs, getting interviews, having as
                    much access to the Italian media as we could. In the Soviet Union it was a
                    totally different ball game.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Sometime between '78 and '82, congress [Italian parliament] passed a law banning
                    the state monopoly on the electronic media, radio and TV. Television stations,
                    literally mom and pop operations, were springing up all over Italy. There were
                    something like 900 television stations, some of them with a broadcasting radius
                    of three inches. There was a whole other outlet for interviews. We tried very
                    hard to figure out which stations are going to survive, which are going to
                    coalesce into private networks of their own.Berlusconi, a recent prime minister
                    before Prodi in Italy, made a fortune setting up a series of private and radio
                    networks based out of Milan. He also used them in his electoral campaigns to the
                    frustration and irritation of some of the older political types who were used to
                    dealing with the established media.</p>
                <p>The newspapers also reflected party affiliation. L'Unita was the Communist Party
                    newspaper; there was no question about that. They were the Pravda and said so on
                    their front page. The other newspapers, like Corriera della Sera, tended to be
                    more favorable towards the Christian Democrats. They were independent papers but
                    still had very definitive political affiliations and leanings that you didn't
                    expect in the States, but that you certainly knew was the case in Moscow. It was
                    a “democratic” society where your media were pretty well identified by political
                    affiliations.</p>
                <p>As you tried to arrange for an interview with La Republica, you knew you were
                    going to speak to the socialist and more leftist political elements of the
                    population. There was that consideration as we tried to get newspapers to place
                    our stories. This was the time when we were trying to place intermediate range
                    missiles in Europe.</p>

                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Right. This was a very touchy issue. Who was going to be first to allow
                    us to place these? The British had, of course, said yes, but the British were
                    not as close (to Russia) as we wanted to be. It was not going to be the French
                    because they were not part of the military alliance of NATO. The Italians kept
                    telling us, “Okay, the British are on board. You get one other then we will do
                    it.”There were heavy efforts to place the U.S. point of view in the media on why
                    we had to respond to the SS-20s; why Italy was so crucial in a geographic sense
                    (We call it our land bound aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean.); and why we
                    wanted them to do this. One of the most successful and satisfying media junkets,
                    if you will, was taking an RAI-1 team, the major television, for something like
                    two weeks on a tour around Europe. We went to look at the Iron Curtain. We flew
                    over the Soviet anchorage off the shores of Libya in the Bay of Hammamet. We
                    went to some of the air bases and saw the underground bunkers of NATO. We landed
                    on an aircraft carrier. It was absolutely fantastic with this RAI team.</p>
                <p>They made a television series, produced by RAI, and we think it had a tremendous
                    amount to do with finally persuading the Italian parliament to vote in favor of
                    placing the cruise missiles. Ten years later when I was back in Italy with
                    another hat on, we were pulling the cruise missiles out of Italy and trying to
                    persuade the Italians that we really didn't need them any more. They were
                    looking at it by that time mainly from an economic point of view; “We are losing
                    jobs; you've built up this infrastructure; please put something else there if
                    you are not going to have this.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about your two ambassadors and how you found
                        theworking with the media, first Gardner.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Gardner was a professor of international law from Columbia University
                    who had been a very active political advisor. He, Brzezinski and Vance had been
                    among the top foreign policy advisors to Carter. He had very close relationships
                    not only with the White House, but with the State Department and with the
                    National Security Council. He was very well plugged in politically back in
                    Washington, which is always a legitimate argument for a political appointee.</p>
                <p>Gardner's other plus was that he knew Italy. He was married to an Italian lady
                    whose family from Jewish background had escaped in 1939 from Venice. He had been
                    a professor who had come and lectured on international law and economics in
                    Italy as a Fulbright professor, or under one guise or another, for practically
                    every year for the last 20 years. He knew Italy. He knew a lot of people. He
                    spoke Italian.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>He was immediately determined to make himself and the Carter administration's
                    policy towards Italy well known throughout the country. He was active with the
                    media and in public speaking to the point of exhaustion. He ate up speech
                    writers and other people. He had a full-time speech writer/press attach� who was
                    in USIS. I sort of ran the part that we've been talking about, the dealings with
                    the media and working with the correspondents, and so on. Another person
                    practically served Richard Gardner full-time writing speeches and setting up
                    speaking engagements for him.</p>
                <p>That changed when Rabb came in. He knew Italy less. He didn't speak Italian very
                    well. He was a very accessible man but in a different way. Gardner was out
                    giving speeches all the time traveling around the country. He was a difficult
                    personality to deal with. He was very demanding, an “I don't suffer fools
                    gladly,” kind of a personality. But those who worked with him in trying to reach
                    out to a lot of Italians, my hat is off to them. He really got out there and he
                    did it.</p>
                <p>Gardner was absolutely convinced in 1980 that Jimmy Carter was going to be
                    president again. We set up one of these election night events in which you put
                    up the boards and report, have tickers going, and everything. We tried to set it
                    up like one of the television press centers. The ambassador insisted that we
                    have it at the residence and we tried to talk him out of this. We had it at the
                    residence and it was a very dismal crowd. They went out of there rather early in
                    the evening, as you will recall.</p>
                <p>Q: How about dealing with terrorism during this time? You had the Red Brigade
                    doing its thing and Moro had been assassinated though probably not on your
                    time.</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: It happened when I was in Bologna.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then General Dozier was kidnapped. Did this involve what
                        yowere doing at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: We talked about the access of the media in Moscow on sensitive issues.
                    In Italy, Dozier was a comparable issue. Here was a high-ranking American
                    general being held by people who had shown with Moro that they would kill him.
                    There was a great deal of sensitivity and concern not only about negotiating
                    with the Red Brigades, not giving them the propaganda advantage that they were
                    looking for by this kidnaping, but to save the man's life. There was a great
                    deal of activity going on which I simply was not aware of. They were protecting
                    the embassy spokesman and the press attach�. I could go and say, “There is a lot
                    going on that I don't know about fellows.” Of course the media had to write
                    their stories, but they were pretty damn understanding of not trying to find and
                    locate Dozier which could have placed his life in danger. “Okay, they know where
                    we are, so we've got to kill him and get out of here.”</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>I worked very closely with the political counselor at the time, Bob Frowick, who
                    was later in Bosnia trying to settle things there. He was the embassy point man
                    on this. There were teams from various U.S. government agencies in-country
                    trying to achieve what they eventually ended up achieving. They got Dozier out
                    alive, unlike Moro.</p>
                <p>As you read Italian history today even, I am often reminded of Oliver Stone's
                    movie about JFK and how that conspiracy won't go away. There are people who
                    absolutely believe that because Aldo Moro was in favor of “compromiso historico”
                    - in other words, a better relationship with the Communist Party - the United
                    States was somehow implicated in his death. There are people who believe that
                    Henry Kissinger said, “Kill him. We don't want him coming out of here.” Also, as
                    you will recall, Moro did a lot of talking about his colleagues in the
                    government with the Brigade Rossi when they had him in captivity and there was a
                    feeling that he was going to come out even more influential within the political
                    establishment.</p>
                <p>Dozier, to the best of our knowledge, did not give state secrets away. He was not
                    an Italian politician. He was a high ranking NATO commander. Of course, the
                    Brigade Rossi were thinking, “This man knows where all the nuclear weapons are
                    and maybe we can steal a nuclear weapon.” There was a tremendous amount of
                    sensitivity and I felt both the Italian and foreign media were quite
                    understanding that this is a very dicey situation and let's try to do as much
                    reporting on it as we can, but let's not run rampant. [Let's do what the]
                    Freedom of Information or Privacy Act dictate.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the feeling when Maxwell Rabb came on board, because he was so
                    different than Richard Gardner? He had initially been offered Switzerland and he
                    said that's not a big enough country, so he was given Italy instead. He wasn't
                    there as an Italian hand but it was more as kind of a reward. What was sort of
                    his initial introduction to the embassy and how did that work out, particularly
                    from your perspective?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I think there may have been, depending on your own political feelings,
                    either great joy or great dismay about Ronald Reagan becoming president. Not
                    only a Republican but a very conservative Republican. I think there was concern
                    about how Maxwell Rabb was going to reflect that in our relationships with
                    Italy.</p>
                <p>What Rabb did was come in and say, “I'm no expert in this country and I will
                    depend very much on my staff.” That is a good way to start off with any staff;
                    that makes you popular. He said, “I don't know as much as my predecessor. I have
                    tremendous relationships with Ronald Reagan and with his people at the National
                    Security Council and other places.” He had the access, but he didn't know the
                    country as well and he turned to his team and said, “Educate me. Help me be a
                    good representative.” I think that won Rabb a lot of admiration and a lot of
                    respect. I think his team at times had more influence than they did under
                    Richard Gardner who said, “I know this country as well as you do and I can make
                    up my own mind about some things.”</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>So after Gardner I was with Maxwell Rabb for just a year. The main way it changed
                    my relationship with the ambassador's office is that Gardner had almost a
                    full-time person working with him. Ambassador Rabb said, “I don't need that. I
                    don't speak Italian. I am not going to be going out doing as many public
                    personal appearances as my predecessor. I am going to depend more on my staff.”
                    I suddenly became a full-time press attach�/ambassadorial spokesman.</p>
                <p>Rabb depended more on his staff, including his press attach�, to issue reports,
                    and so on, in his name. He was much less media-oriented than Gardner had been.
                    Gardner liked to do the interviews himself, talk to the newspaper reporters, and
                    go on television himself. So there was more work in that sense, which was more
                    satisfying in some way, and less in some ways in having an ambassador who was
                    not as much of an expert, in other words, you got to do more. I think Rabb had a
                    pretty good track record in Italy and in running an embassy in that way,
                    probably up until the kidnaping of the terrorists out of Egypt of the Achille
                    Lauro ship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I was not. I was not even in Italian affairs at the time, so I only
                    know what I read. Here was a real crisis in Italian-U.S. relations and we wanted
                    those people, but the main terrorist was released, as you will recall. There was
                    a bit of a black mark on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there, I guess, when there was that supposedly
                        righwing explosion in, was it Milan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: In Bologna at the railroad station. A lot of people blamed the Brigade
                    Rossi. One of the lines of the Brigade Rossi is, “Yes, we do carry out terrorist
                    acts in order to call attention to the justness of our cause, but we don't do
                    half of them; half of them are done by the right wing trying to make us look
                    bad.” It took the government a long time to go and look at the explosives, to
                    interview people, to look at the way access was made to the stations, and so on.
                    This was a case where in subsequent investigations, it does begin to look as
                    though it was a right wing effort to paint the Brigade Rossi in a bad light by
                    doing it in Bologna, which was the buckle of the red belt, right there in the
                    train station, with a lot of innocent people killed. There we were trying to
                    help out with the basic investigation of figuring out who was responsible for
                    this thing. There was no direct involvement of U.S. strategic or human concerns
                    as there was in the case of General Dozier's kidnaping.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you get involved much with the media over the presence of American troops?
                    We had some rather large bases such as in Naples, and then Ciganella and Aviano.
                    We also had three man listening posts, the whole thing. Did they cause a
                    relations problem?</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Surely, in both directions. There was a problem coming in with a new
                    base to place the cruise missiles, and then there was a problem removing that
                    base because of the economic aspects. The Italian government was not always a
                    Christian Democratic government. Spadolini was the prime minister. He was a
                    Republican, not like our Republican Party, but a small party. It was a coalition
                    compromise between the Christian Democrats, the communists, and the socialists,
                    in order to put him there. Basically the entire time I was there, the government
                    tended to be favorable to our bases because they were a loyal, faithful ally of
                    the United States and it gave economic advantage to Italy. They tended to try to
                    put them in the south whereas we wanted them in the north because of the
                    proximity (to Russia). They wanted them in the south because of economic
                    reasons.</p>
                <p>They realized that demonstrations could spring up, there could be local
                    resistance to various things, particularly things like we've seen recently in
                    Aviano with this terrible ski gondola incident there. Or the common thing that
                    happens throughout the world with sailors on leave, with the raping of a young
                    girl, or a fight that breaks out in a bar.</p>
                <p>The military always has public affairs officers assigned to commands. We tried to
                    meet frequently outside of crises situations, when we were trying to work out
                    what the embassy was going to say, and what the military command was going to
                    say in response to an incident. We would gather together all the public affairs
                    officers at least four times a year and work on what to do to improve
                    relationships and perceptions of the base within a particular community on a
                    regular basis: things like sports activities, humanitarian efforts, working with
                    the local orphanages, inviting people not just when a ship visit comes in, when
                    you always organize a visit, but bringing people onto the base. Show them that
                    the bunkers are not glowing green and that there are not people stored away who
                    are ready to run out and take control of Italy if the PCI wins the next
                    election, that sort of stuff. We tried to establish as close a working
                    relationship as we could with the military commands because it was a constant
                    concern.</p>
                <p>There was a civilian plane that was downed when I was there. I think it was
                    flying between Naples and Sicily. It just fell out of the sky, sort of like the
                    Trans World Airline. To this day, it is gospel among the conspiratorial cliques
                    within the country that it was a NATO missile that brought this airplane down.
                    Nothing was ever proved. It was like TWA, what happened? Our intelligence is a
                    little better these days and we think the TWA wasn't a missile, but we don't
                    really know what caused that plane to blow up. This one was the same way. But
                    those kinds of mythologies persist. Ustica was a little island north of Sicily
                    where it fell into the sea and you say that word today, Ustica, and they know
                    exactly what you are talking about, that plane that NATO shot down.</p>
                <p>Q: It sounds like this was a pretty active time for you. How about presidential
                    visits? Ronald Reagan obviously must have come there, and you probably also had
                    Carter visit.</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes, we had both.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: A presidential visit, particularly to an ally like Italy which is a
                    close ally, is always a big deal. I think any country, friend or foe,
                    appreciates the U.S. president visiting. You are the biggest, most powerful, and
                    we weren't the only “superpower” in the world at the time, but we were certainly
                    their superpower. It is paying respect to your country so you always wanted the
                    visit. And the ambassador, especially if he is a political type, he wants his
                    good friend Ronald Reagan or his good friend Jimmy Carter to come and stay in
                    the residence, and spend as much time as he possibly can. There is always
                    pressure both from the host country and from your own embassy about getting as
                    many presidential visits as you possibly can.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One presidential visit is equivalent to two
                        earthquakes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes, and we had earthquakes, too. The things you tend to note are in
                    spite of your own political inclinations. I happen to lean more toward the
                    Democratic Party and so I tended to think that democratic administrations would
                    have a more “enlightened” policy towards these countries. In spite of that, we
                    had a hell of a time dealing with some of the press and media staff of Jimmy
                    Carter's White House. When Ronald Reagan's crew came to town, it reflected
                    Maxwell Rabb's feeling of “I depend more on my staff; you guys tell me what to
                    do; you want to set up a press conference, we will see what we can do.” It was
                    not that totally, of course. The White House always is looking for one thing
                    first. Mike Deaver wants to make Ronald Reagan look the best he can, Jody Powell
                    wants to make Jimmy Carter look the best he can. That is their primary aim.</p>
                <p>In presidential visits, they focus on how it is going to play back home.
                    Therefore, they are looking more at the domestic media. No matter whether it was
                    Republican or Democratic, conservative or liberal, we had trouble convincing
                    them that the United States has a stake in having local media access to the
                    President, too. Many times, one of the arguments I would use is, “Look, the New
                    York Times and the Washington Post read Corriere della Sera and La Republica,
                    and they are going to pick up from their stories; therefore, if you get a bad
                    story in La Republica, you may get a bad story in the New York Times as a result
                    of that. Think about it because it is to your benefit.”</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>Our point of view was as much media access as we possibly could no matter who the
                    President was. The Secret Service's attitude was to have minimal exposure to the
                    President. There is a constant battle in embassies between the security officer
                    who is trying to think how he can protect the embassy staff, and the USIS
                    operation, which wants the doors as wide open and as much glass showing as
                    possible. It is a natural conflict which will go through forever, and
                    presidential visits were the same way. We tried to have as much exposure as we
                    possibly could, get as much media coverage as we could, favorable, of course.
                    You are constantly dealing with the U.S. press corps, which wants exclusivity,
                    and the security guys who want protection.</p>
                <p>In terms of Ronald Reagan being better accepted or received than Jimmy Carter?
                    No. The Italians were very happy to have a presidential visit, to be recognized.
                    They provided as much cooperation as they could. I never had a presidential
                    visit in Moscow, but [I did have] a Secretary of State visit, and it was a very
                    controlled kind of situation.</p>
                <p>Q: Just one last question, did the earthquake down in southern Italy play much of
                    a role there? As we both know I was consul general down there so that was a big
                    deal for me. We had Joe Bertot down there, who was excellent support. How did
                    that play up in Rome?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: As you know better than I, there are a lot of U.S. politicians with
                    roots in Italy and in that sense, when you are going to have a Senator D'Amato,
                    and you remember better than I do because you dealt more than I did with...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Claiborne Pell was there practically before the

                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Right. They wanted to go right out to the village anhave their picture
                    taken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With a helicopter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: That's right, I flew in with him. Not with Pell, with D'Amato. Of
                    course the ambassador is going to be keenly interested when high ranking
                    congressional and administration officials are coming in, so to that extent, and
                    to the extent of helping people, the embassy gets very involved, though not as
                    much as you are involved when you are on the scene. I had been through an
                    earthquake when we were in Caracas and the embassy was damaged, we were right on
                    top of it.</p>
                <p>Q: D'amato was terribly unimpressive. He had not even been sworn in as a senator
                    from New York. He came in with monsignor... I never quite figured out who he
                    was. When you all came in, he was running all over the place.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: All I can remember is that he wanted to be poised on toof rubble piles

                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: '84.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about being assigned there and what were
                        yohearing about the situation before you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I had served in Latin America before and had some Spanish which by this
                    time had become somewhat confused with the Italian. I still retained an interest
                    in Latin American affairs. The Sandinista revolution had kicked out Somoza in
                    1979. The Reagan administration was making quite a show of being concerned about
                    the Sandinistas - that this was going to become the first foothold on the
                    mainland of Latin America, after Castro in Cuba, of the communists.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>When I received this assignment, I objected strenuously. It was the first time I
                    had ever done that in my Foreign Service career. I said I would be very happy to
                    work on Nicaraguan affairs, I was concerned about the issues myself, but I felt
                    that I wanted to come back to Washington because that was where the decisions
                    were being made. I did not want to go to Nicaragua for a variety of reasons,
                    some substantive, but also because I had three young children and the situation,
                    both from a schooling and medical point of view, from everything that we were
                    hearing was deteriorating rapidly.</p>
                <p>It ended up that I was ordered to go to Nicaragua and was told that the
                    combination that I had, background in both the Soviet Union and in Latin
                    America, was unique. I'm not sure that I believed that but anyway that was the
                    line they were feeding me, and there was nobody else who could go as the
                    counselor for public affairs at that particular point to Nicaragua. For the
                    first and last time in my Foreign Service career, I went without my family. I
                    chose to do the separation and have them back here in Washington because of the
                    schooling and medical reasons that I mentioned.</p>
                <p>I went off quite reluctantly and unhappily to Nicaragua although once I had
                    decided I would accept the assignment, I did a lot of consulting in Washington,
                    both academically and within various agencies that were operating there. I knew
                    people at State, Defense, and the CIA from my Latin American days and from my
                    European days, and I felt that I was pretty well prepared. As a consequence, it
                    turned out to be one of the most fascinating assignments I had. It is sort of
                    like the Soviet Union, you can't say you really enjoyed it, but it was extremely
                    educational and challenging throughout, and I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the
                    Nicaraguans and maintain contact with some to this day.</p>
                <p>Q: What were you getting as you were doing this briefing, going through both the
                    academic and government agencies? There seemed to be a fairly solid split. Were
                    you getting that?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: No. To be quite honest what I got was a spectrum of opinion. At one end
                    of the spectrum there were people who were solidly convinced that this was
                    indeed a vital threat to the security of the hemisphere, and the security of the
                    United States. President Reagan at one point, I can't remember the exact quote,
                    but said, “Next week they may be in Harlingen, Texas.” At the other end were
                    people who felt that we were beating up on a small, poor, underdeveloped Latin
                    American country which had suffered tremendously over the decades from U.S.
                    intervention. Indeed U.S. marines had been dispatched to Nicaragua on a number
                    of occasions before the second world war and we had maintained a presence there
                    up until the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt when the last of the
                    Marines came out. There was a spectrum in between those extremes of, “we are the
                    devil, or we are the angels.”</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>I found the more time I spent in Nicaragua, the more that was the message I tried
                    to give not only to the Nicaraguan contacts I had, but to the constant flow of
                    American officials and do-gooders, priests, humanitarian workers, students, and
                    you name it, who were a constant responsibility for those of us in the embassy
                    and particularly for those of us who were responsible for meeting and dealing
                    with the public. Both ambassadors that I served with there, and I, were
                    constantly meeting with Americans who were coming down who also matched that
                    spectrum from right to left, or from absolutely opposed, to absolutely in favor.
                    Part of the message I think that we tried to give is that this is a gray
                    situation; there are no right or wrong answers; it is a very difficult and
                    complex situation.</p>
                <p>We tried to convey to them that if they really strongly opposed the policy, that
                    unlike the regime that was being installed in Nicaragua at the time, we did have
                    a democracy and they should come back here and inform their elected political
                    leaders. They should get them out of office if they didn't agree with them, or
                    convince them to change their minds if they did. If they strongly felt that this
                    regime was a threat, then we tried to show them a little bit of just what a
                    poor, underdeveloped country Nicaragua was, and in my strong opinion I think it
                    certainly was no direct threat to the power of the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Managua itself pretty well devastated by the
                        earthquake? Hait recovered much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: It reminded me of nothing so much as a modern day Pompeii. Anyone who
                    has ever visited Pompeii, as you certainly have, is struck by the sense of
                    feeling that you are walking through a city which had been suddenly deserted,
                    devastated to a degree. You see streets, you see parts of buildings, you can
                    certainly get a sense of what shops and homes were like. Downtown Managua, which
                    had been devastated by an earthquake in 1972, so it was just about 10 years
                    later, in which over 5,000 people had been killed, had hardly been
                    reconstructed.</p>
                <p>In my opinion, it was one of the nails in the coffin of the Somoza regime that a
                    lot of money went down there, both privately donated money and American aid
                    money, and other sources of income, to help Nicaragua restore itself and recover
                    from this terrible disaster, and it had simply been stolen. It had been used by
                    Somoza and his family and crony connections to build shopping centers and other
                    things. It had not been used in large part to restore the country. This was very
                    obvious to the common people. Nicaragua is a very small country. There are only
                    three million people. People know each other, and they know what is happening in
                    the country. I think that to go down there and see it for yourself, was an
                    affirmation of why Somoza did have to go, not only from a repressive point of
                    view, but from simply a robber baron point of view. He ran it as though it were
                    his private holdings.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>One was struck constantly throughout by the U.S. attitude. I presume this is a
                    historic fact, but we deal with a lot of unsavory characters throughout the
                    world. Back in the days when Roosevelt was dealing with Somoza, and the Somoza
                    family goes back that far with the original Anastacio, FDR said, “He's a son of
                    a bitch, but he is our son of a bitch.” Some people tended to look at the
                    Sandinistas as well, they are sons of bitches and they are the other guy's sons
                    of bitches; in this case the Soviets or Castro.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: The two ambassadors were both very good career ambassadors. The first
                    was Tony Quainton, who is one of the names, if you haven't...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've had a long interview with him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Great. He's recently retired as you know after being director general
                    of the Foreign Service. He was replaced by, unfortunately deceased, Harry
                    Bergold. Quainton came with a tremendous amount of experience in underdeveloped
                    areas of the world, and Bergold came in with a lot of experience in communist
                    countries; he had been ambassador to Hungary. They came with different
                    perspectives on the country, but both had quite a bit of background in dealing
                    with Nicaragua.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Quainton use you when you arrived? Sort of what
                        did htell you he wanted to be done?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Quainton wanted to go as far as he possibly could in normalizing
                    relations, in trying to get some kind of a dialogue going. I thoroughly agreed
                    with him. I like to think of myself as a people person. I like to reach out and
                    so on. One of the disagreements that we had - I thought that Tony wanted to go
                    further than was possible and it turned out that we both thought we were right -
                    he wanted to open a cultural center; a place where we could teach English, have
                    performances, and so on. All of my contacts among the Sandinistas, among the
                    officials and opposition as well, said it wasn't going to work. Indeed it didn't
                    work. It didn't work until a good number of years after I had gone.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>He pushed in that direction and I was in favor of pushing as far as we could.
                    Make as many contacts as you can. Convince the Sandinistas that we are not bent
                    on seeing them all hanging from the nearest lamppost, and convince the United
                    States administration that there were advantages to having some kind of
                    relations, some kind of a dialogue, with the Sandinista regime.One of the things
                    that I tried to do, very forcefully during the two years that I was there, was
                    to get a Fulbright exchange program reinstalled. It had existed, and then it had
                    been cut off. I wasn't able to do it from the Sandinista side. They wouldn't
                    agree to it, but neither would the American side. They simply said there is no
                    reason; we are wasting our time; those people are hopeless; we are not going to
                    have this kind of exchange. I felt frustration in both directions about trying
                    to establish that kind of academic and educational exchange program.</p>
                <p>Q: When you got there and started sampling, what was your impression of the
                    Sandinista regime? I mean you had your Soviet time and all and your Yugoslav
                    time, what did you think of the Sandinista regime?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I tended to agree with Harry Bergold who came later and said, “They are
                    a bunch of rank amateurs. They don't really know what Marxism is all about.” The
                    nine commandantees who formed the directorate of the Sandinista regime came from
                    three different factions. Tomas Borge was the oldest and was probably in his 50s
                    at the time. He was by at least a decade, if not more, the oldest member of the
                    nine. He and Carlos Fonseca had been among the original people who had
                    established the Sandinista Party.</p>
                <p>Just a little bit of background. Antonio Sandino had been a popular rebel who had
                    fought against the marines in the '20s and '30s. They took his name to epitomize
                    their anti-Yankee, anti-imperialist, anti-capitalistic kind of mantra that they
                    chanted rather frequently. The best that I can read, Sandino was no Marxist.
                    They simply appropriated the name and utilized it as a popular figure.</p>
                <p>The commandantees ranged I think from Borge who had struggled a long time and had
                    been out in the hills for a long time, to the Ortega brothers. I think Borge was
                    a rather dedicated, although extremely clever, individual. He was the minister
                    of the interior which means he headed the interior police, and so on, and, as I
                    say, he was a commandante and they all had military responsibilities. Borge
                    maintained several offices. He had his official office as the minister of
                    interior where he would receive official callers. He had a private office which
                    was very small and modest. There was another office where he kept crucifixes all
                    over the wall and showed what a humanitarian and Christian background this
                    country had. Depending on who his visitor was, he would welcome them in one of
                    the three offices.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>The Ortega brothers were kind of the leaders. Daniel Ortega was the head of the
                    junta and the president of the country. His brother Humberto was the minister of
                    defense and thereby the head of the army. I think they thought they were
                    Marxists but the things that bothered me more than anything were the foreign
                    advisors that they brought in. They brought in Cubans and East Germans, and this
                    I thought posed more of a danger than the Sandinistas themselves. If we could
                    convince them that they could perform some kind of a revolutionary activity in
                    the country, which it certainly needed given the Somoza background, then we
                    would move along the lines of trying to have a dialogue that Ambassador
                    Quainton, and Bergold in a different way, tried to foster.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your work, was there a press to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: There indeed was a press. The New York Times had a resident there.
                    Others lived in Salvador, and there was a lot going on in El Salvador at the
                    time. One of the aspects of the whole Sandinista situation in Nicaragua was that
                    these self-proclaimed Marxists had taken over, and they were supporting a
                    revolution which was still going on against the government that we were
                    supporting in El Salvador. We tried to reach out to the journalists, a number of
                    whom - New York Times, Time Magazine, Los Angeles Times, Miami Herald - sent
                    pretty experienced people in the Latin American area. For example, Steven Kinser
                    was there, who is now in Turkey and before that was in Berlin. Before coming to
                    Nicaragua he had covered Guatemala in Latin America and had written a book about
                    Guatemala and U.S. intervention in '54 in the Guzman regime there. I thought he
                    was a very balanced and critical reporter.</p>
                <p>You also had a number of what people derisively call “Sandalistas,” people who
                    came down in their sandals and who were very favorably disposed to the
                    Sandinista revolution. They either refused to see, or overlooked mistakes or
                    erroneous directions that more objective observers, in my opinion, felt that the
                    Sandinistas were making. There was too much expropriation of land discouraging
                    any remnants of the old capitalistic system to remain, and this is necessary
                    because you need a transition period. It was difficult to deal with them. We
                    dealt with them as with all reporters, the doors were open. But some of them
                    were pretty openly biased in their opinions. As I say the standard press was
                    pretty balanced in trying to do its reporting.</p>
                <p>Dealing with the Nicaraguan journalists was quite a different matter. The
                    Sandinistas established a newspaper, Barricada, the barricades. La Prensa had
                    been the old newspaper of Chamorro and Pedro Joaquin Chamorro had been another
                    nail in the coffin of Somoza. He had been assassinated on the streets of Managua
                    because he had been a very strong critic of the Somoza regime. After Chamorro
                    was assassinated, his widow, Violetta, who subsequently after the Sandinistas
                    became president of Nicaragua, and his son, Pedro Joaquin, Junior, moved into
                    the newspaper and harshly attacked the Sandinista regime. They were really
                    trying to bring democracy, neither from the right nor from the left, but a
                    democratic regime. However, the younger brother of Pedro Joaquin, Carlos, became
                    the chief editor of Barricada.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>So the Chamorro family history is interesting and this was repeated a lot in this
                    small country. It was divided right down the middle on the Sandinistas, and how
                    much they could be helped, and how much they could be resisted. We saw it in the
                    newspapers very strongly, in Barricada, the organ of the Sandinista party. La
                    Prensa was still being critical and being censored. Like in an old communist
                    state, you would see whole pages blanked out or blacked out, and they would
                    publish it that way. Sometimes they would get away with it, and sometimes Tomas
                    Borge, the minister of interior, guardian of the internal security, simply
                    ordered the paper taken off the streets because they didn't want to show how
                    much had been censored.</p>
                <p>I found that some of the Sandinista media, like Barricada or like the main
                    Sandinista radio station, were pretty open to interviews. We would bring down
                    Otto Reich who was in the State Department at the time playing a very active
                    role in combating what we saw as the disinformation policy of the Sandinistas
                    and the Castroites in Latin America. He visited Nicaragua and we got him
                    interviews with Barricada and on the Sandinista radio station which was, I
                    think, a nod that they had not become as controlled as some people would like to
                    paint them. It was a fascinating mixture of dealing both with the foreign press,
                    who were there covering the revolution, and the Nicaraguan press.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find sort of the American academic community because this was a
                    red hot issue with them? Did you find yourself sort of an outcast?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: It was divided. There were academics who came down who were very
                    strongly opposed to the Sandinista regime and very critical of it. They had
                    equal academic credentials as the more, what we traditionally tend to think of
                    academics as being, liberal and supportive of the Sandinistas.</p>
                <p>People used to ask me, “Don't you find that dealing with the journalists is a
                    real headache, a real pain in the butt?” I used to say that the journalists are
                    sort of third on my list. Some of them are very dedicated, and some of them are
                    very dedicated to espousing their own opinions. I put them ahead of many
                    congressional figures who used to come down and spend a day or two days at the
                    most in Nicaragua, and there were a lot of them who came down. I used to
                    classify them, I used to joke, into two categories, the IWTs and the ITTs. The
                    IWTs were the, “I was there and I know what is going on.” The ITTs were the, “I
                    told them; how they ordered them to shape up and fly right.The most difficult
                    group of all to deal with were the religious people who would come down. Either
                    God had told them that the Sandinista regime was the devil incarnate or that the
                    American presence there was the devil incarnate. They were very, very difficult
                    to be swayed. They would come into the embassy. I have sat there as the
                    ambassador and I briefed them, and they would stand up and scream at the
                    ambassador and say, “You're going to hell for what you are doing here!” He took
                    it very well.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>Q: Yes, Tony told one story about how some nuns came in and asked if they could
                    pray at the end and he said of course. They all gathered hands, including Tony
                    there, and he found himself in a prayer group praying against Ronald Reagan.</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Right, and praying for the salvation of his soul becaushe was carrying
                    out that policy, exactly.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find yourself and other officers in the embassy? Were they pretty
                    much, this is just a problem to deal with, or did you find them sort of
                    reflecting the spectrum or not? Did you have trouble with your officers?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: No. I think they did tend to reflect the spectrum, but I found it a
                    situation similar to working in Moscow. When you are under difficult
                    circumstances, and that can be either physically difficult circumstances or
                    politically, I find the embassy team pulling together. I found that to be the
                    case very much in Nicaragua whether they tended to disagree or to agree with the
                    policy, they pulled together. They were there as professionals working under
                    difficult circumstances. It was a very tightly knit team just as I found the
                    case to be back in Moscow when I had served 10 years before that.</p>
                <p>The problem came with some of the Foreign Service nationals. As you well know,
                    USIS overseas generally employees more Foreign Service nationals, both in the
                    cultural and informational side, than most other sections. In the course of my
                    time there, two people were accused by anonymous sources at the time of being
                    spies for the Sandinistas. We looked into this along with the regional security
                    officer. I didn't really feel that there was sufficient evidence on either case,
                    although one was much stronger - circumstantial evidence in my opinion - than
                    the other. The regional security officer and I divided, one went and one didn't
                    go.</p>
                <p>It was a very difficult situation because as you well know in many cases our
                    Foreign Service national employees are some of the most dedicated people. They
                    have stuck their necks out, worked for the United States government, and been
                    identified as such for years, through thick and thin. It is always a difficult
                    matter to accuse one of having become a turncoat. It certainly could have been
                    true. The Sandinista secret police certainly knew how to put the screws on
                    people, there is no question about that. We had no question whatsoever that
                    everybody in the embassy, just as we knew in Moscow, was being closely
                    questioned. Whether they crossed the line but, of course, they had no access to
                    classified information either. The Foreign Service nationals had a very
                    difficult time during that period in Nicaragua.</p>
                <p>Q: You would have pronouncements coming from the president and then you had Jesse
                    Helms and all, and these people would be talking in apocalyptic terms, and here
                    you are down there living in this country that is kind of not much of a country.
                    I would have thought that it would have been very difficult to deal with this. I
                    mean interpret it, translate it, and keep from giggling almost.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Well, there was a Contra war going on, and although the controversy
                    still rages and all the facts still aren't out about just how much we were
                    behind it and how much we were doing, it was a serious situation and we took it
                    very seriously. A war was going on. No matter how much you dismiss their ability
                    to directly threaten the security of the United States, you certainly took
                    seriously some of the actions that they were taking.One of them that I was
                    directly involved in was the educational system. Education and cultural affairs
                    are part of the USIS bag and I tried to establish very close relationships, or
                    as close as possible, with the educational institutions, especially the higher
                    educational institutions. At the National University, the Sandinistas had moved
                    in as communist regimes will do, because they realize the importance of
                    instilling a doctrine in the youth, in the future leadership of the country.</p>
                <p>One of the big disappointments that I had was a man by the name of Carlos
                    Tunnerman. He had been a very prominent man, and very well educated in the
                    United States. He was a brilliant man and became the minister of education. I
                    continued to deal with him and I thought we had a dialogue going in which he
                    would admit to certain excess. He later became the ambassador to the United
                    States under the Sandinista regime and that is when we parted company. I could
                    see him continuing to work in the university as a minister of education and
                    being somewhat balanced, but taking the step to actually becoming the spokesman
                    in this country of the Sandinista regime, I was somewhat surprised.</p>
                <p>In our effort to interpret what the Reagan administration was saying about
                    Nicaragua, we would try to put it in terms of some of those areas like the
                    educational system, or confiscation of private property, literally taking over
                    houses and forcing people out because a commandante wanted it. We would object
                    to those specific actions.</p>
                <p>On the war itself, we were no better informed, quite frankly, than much of the
                    populace. The Contra effort was being run out of other countries like Honduras
                    and in some places in El Salvador. I am sure that some people in the embassy
                    knew more than I did about what was going on, but basically we were not terribly
                    informed and would not address the Sandinistas directly when they raised issues.
                    They would raise an issue and make a protest, and we would respond that we knew
                    nothing about that particular action because it was under the umbrella of the
                    independent Contra activities. It was a difficult situation, to answer in those
                    terms, because it was a civil war in some senses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel almost marginalized by these operators who
                        were coming down from the NSC, Ollie North and company, who were kind of
                        running things? I almost feel there wasn't much of a coordinated effort. It
                        was as though you had this not that little of war going on, and it was run
                        out of the NSC, and then the State Department was trying to maintain regular
                        relations. It was a peculiar thing. Did you feel this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes, you certainly did. I indicated that when I first was assigned to
                    Nicaragua. I said, “I don't want to go to Nicaragua. I'll be happy to work on
                    Nicaraguan policy but I want to do it from Washington.” And that hadn't changed.
                    After that I was assigned on two occasions TDY to the National Security Council
                    and had occasion to sit in on meetings with Ollie North and watch the operation.
                    I must say that I thought it was a highly arrogant attitude from some of these
                    people who had absolutely determined that the Sandinista regime did represent a
                    threat to the United States, whether it was as potential allies of Cuba,
                    supporters of the revolution that was being fostered by the FSLN in El Salvador,
                    or as a potential base for the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>There is no question that the Sandinistas were certainly building up their
                    military and that was a worrisome aspect, not only in the terms of the threat
                    that it could pose to its neighbors, but in terms of what it was taking away
                    from the country. I mentioned earlier the concern about not only the educational
                    system crumbling and becoming ideologically influenced by the Sandinistas, but
                    the medical situation. The reason for that was that the medical supplies were
                    largely flowing to support the military in its fighting with the Contra forces,
                    but also building up an awful lot of camps, air bases of a size which the
                    Sandinista air force didn't have any need. These were concerns.</p>
                <p>But I think about people like Ollie North and of seeing him on a couple of
                    occasions coming into meetings - and these with people working for the National
                    Security Council, or representative of the Department of State or the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, or the Department of Defense, all highly qualified people,
                    all highly cleared people - and North if he didn't like the discussion that was
                    going on he would suddenly stand up, whip his papers into a pad and say, “I've
                    got better things to do. I don't need to listen to this,” and he'd stalk out.
                    That kind of arrogance which displayed itself within the inner circles, I think,
                    displayed itself rather publicly in his declarations before the Congress; “If
                    this is what we thought was right to do, we went ahead and did it, and we
                    weren't going to be bent by laws.” I think that is a danger to a democracy.</p>
                <p>Q: How about staffers from the various congressional committees and staffers to
                    individual people in Congress, did they present a particular challenge?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Staffers came down. Nicaragua at that point was enough on the scene
                    that they would usually accompany members. It was good that a member himself or
                    herself came down. Once again, they represented a spectrum. One that I remember
                    very strongly, who was a senator at the time, is now Secretary of Defense. Cohen
                    was a Republican member of Congress at the time. A very opened and balanced
                    “Tell me, and I want to learn,” attitude.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about Secretary William Cohen from
                        Maine.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Exactly. He was very good. Others came down and knew it all. I'll tell
                    you about the famous Kissinger Commission on Central America. There was a spread
                    from Henry Cisneros to Jeane Kirkpatrick. They came and visited all of the
                    Central American countries, I guess, or most of them to sort of assess the
                    situation in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. Nicaragua and El Salvador
                    were the focus at the time. The one that I faulted the most was Jeane
                    Kirkpatrick who refused to come to Nicaragua, the only member of the commission
                    that I recall, because she felt that her life was in danger. I think the embassy
                    assured the rest of the commission, her included, that it was not in danger, but
                    that was the extent I think of the fear of what this little country represented
                    to some people - that they might be assassinated if they came.I don't think a
                    lot was learned, quite frankly, by the Kissinger Commission, but at least they
                    came. They sat down, they met. Part of that I will hasten to add was the
                    Sandinistas fault. The Sandinistas can be very clever. I mentioned Borge, who
                    could go into his crucifix decorated room and be very convincing and
                    disingenuous, and apparently very flexible. But on this occasion, they got their
                    backs up about the Kissinger Commission and it was a very entrenched attitude
                    that they displayed.</p>
                <p>The worse case of that that I saw, and I think one of most stupid things the
                    Sandinistas did in the entire two years I was there, was their reception for the
                    Pope. Nicaragua is a very, very Catholic country. It is basically a strongly,
                    religious Catholic country in which the people are very devout. The Pope is the
                    head of the Catholic Church and he was coming to Nicaragua, and they were
                    terribly proud of it. The Sandinistas were terribly proud that the Pope, as when
                    he went to Cuba recently, had decided to come to Nicaragua.</p>
                <p>They organized, and they did this deliberately. Women who, I do not doubt for a
                    moment, had lost their sons in the struggle with the Contras, heckled the Pope.
                    They said, “We want peace. Holy Father go tell the bloody Americans what they
                    are doing.” This did not go over with the Pope and it did not go over with the
                    majority of the population. You do not insult the Holy Father. It is not his war
                    and you simply do not interrupt the mass. They interrupted the mass which is a
                    very sacred ceremony for Catholics and it was a dumb, stupid thing to do. They
                    kept making mistakes like this. You would think they were about to take a step
                    forward, and they would insert their foot solidly in their mouth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of the Cubans and the Soviets when you
                        werthere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Well they were certainly there and the Nicaraguans made of point of
                    identifying themselves much more closely with the Castro revolution in Cuba,
                    being a Latin America country, being a country which had defied directly the
                    United States, than they ever did with the Soviet Union. They were wise in that
                    sense to keep a certain amount of distance. Of course, the Soviets funneled a
                    lot of the aid indirectly through Cuba rather than directly.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>The Soviets kept pretty much to themselves as they do in a lot of overseas
                    missions, as do the Chinese to this day. They live within a closed compound so
                    you really didn't see them very much on the scene. They did not make their
                    presence visible. The Cubans were the same way. More of our information there
                    came from our intelligence sources or just from sources that would go out and
                    interview people and say, “Do you know some Cubans?” “Yes, three guys came by
                    and had a beer in my place yesterday.” For the public in Nicaragua they tried to
                    portray it as an indigenous revolution. As I mentioned, along with the
                    “Sandalistas,” which were the followers of the revolution, there were some nasty
                    folks in there like Libyans and others who were advising the Sandinistas on how
                    to handle their revolution.</p>
                <p>Q: Speaking of the Sandalistas, how about the people coming over from Western
                    Europe, particularly from the socialist, the left wing side? Did you see your
                    friends from Italy and all of that?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: We did indeed, and representations from some Scandinavian countries and
                    people like Greenpeace and Oxfam were there. Some of them were doing very good
                    work. Some were working out in the rural areas of Nicaragua helping with crop
                    reform, with health problems, and so on. Others were very active in the
                    demonstrations. I talked before about the church and this was where a lot of
                    influence came through. There was very definitely the liberation theology strain
                    of Catholicism in Latin America which went back far before the Sandinista
                    revolution.</p>
                <p>Q: The Maryknoll sisters?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: The Maryknoll sisters. The foreign minister of Nicaragua was a
                    Maryknoll priest who had actually studied in the United States. The minister of
                    education after Tunnerman was a Jesuit priest, and the minister of culture was a
                    brother of the minister of education who belonged to, I've forgotten what order,
                    but they were all Catholic priests. This gave the church in Rome problems too,
                    because they wanted to separate political ideology from religious ideology and
                    they were disturbed by this mix. They never went so far as to excommunicate the
                    two priest ministers, but they did insist, which the brothers ignored, that they
                    could not perform the sacraments, that they could not be active as priests. They
                    ignored this. There was this liberation theology group and there were some very
                    active ministers who came down, who were of the extreme left, extremely
                    favorable to the revolution, from the United States. There was very definitely
                    this element active within the populace of Nicaragua as well, liberation
                    churches or churches of the revolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did many of these people sort of bypass the embassy or did
                        thego to shout at you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: They shouted on occasions. A lot of people ask me, did I ever feel in
                    mortal danger in Nicaragua? My answer is only on one occasion was I concerned
                    and that was during the invasion of Grenada. I think when that invasion took
                    place, the Sandinistas sincerely believed for a number of days that only a few
                    days would pass before they were next. There were tanks outside the embassy and
                    the turrets were pointed towards the embassy, not away from the embassy. There
                    was concern for a few days.</p>
                <p>The ambassador, who at time was Tony Quainton, got on the phone to the minister
                    of the interior, Tomas Borge and there was a discussion about how it's not going
                    to happen. There was a pretty violent demonstration which formed downtown which
                    was maybe a mile and a half of so from where the embassy was located. It was
                    announced, it was in the papers, that they were going to march on the embassy,
                    but it was called off. The demonstration took place and there were rocks thrown,
                    shouts, and so on, but they did not come to the embassy.</p>
                <p>I think the Sandinistas themselves, within the course of a little more than 24
                    hours, perhaps 48 hours, accepted the assurances that the paratroopers were not
                    coming and that that kind of a demonstration - unlike in my humble opinion what
                    is happening in China right now - could get out of hand, so they defused it a
                    bit. They didn't call it off entirely, but they did defuse it. That was the kind
                    of dialogue that at times you could have with the Sandinistas.</p>
                <p>There was another occasion that I recall very fondly. There was a very close,
                    very young advisor to Daniel Ortega that I used to meet with. The Ortega
                    brothers themselves were quite young at the time, but this fellow must have been
                    in his mid-20s at the most. I've forgotten how I met him, but we would meet
                    almost twice a month on weekends and just go for sort of walks in the jungle, if
                    you will, and just talk about a lot of things. He was a very dedicated
                    Sandinista. He claimed not to be pro-Soviet Union at all. We would have
                    extremely frank exchanges and I hope it was as useful to his side as I felt it
                    was to our side. We both knew that we were going back and reporting on the
                    exchanges that took place. That was the sort of thing that I never felt that I
                    had in the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>Q: As far as being communists, you say that they were amateurs, was it that
                    things weren't ripe for it, or they were sort of communists of opportunity?</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: That's a good question. I think it is a combination. I think some of
                    them were definitely communists of opportunity, or Marxists, if you will, of
                    opportunity. Conditions certainly weren't right. I don't know that much about
                    the history of Russia, but I think that the Russian Orthodox Church was a strong
                    influence which continued to be an influence after the Soviets took over. From
                    my reading of history, one of the things that was clear throughout is that it
                    was never as strong an influence in impeding the development of
                    communism/socialism, the establishment of Lenin's regime and then Stalin's, as
                    the Catholic Church was in impeding the development of Marxism in Nicaragua, at
                    least in that short period of time. Who knows whether it could have taken place
                    over a longer period of time, but the church and the strong deep rooted faith of
                    the people were clearly important factors.</p>
                <p>And another thing, I think that in spite of all the propaganda that the
                    Sandinistas put out continually, the Nicaraguan people were basically not
                    anti-American, they were pro-American. The history that the Sandinistas tried to
                    draw of the U.S. intervention was always mollified for a lot of the “common”
                    Nicaraguan folks that I talked with who remembered very fondly the uncle, or the
                    grandfather, who had a job, or who worked with the Marines when they were there
                    and helped them build roads, or set up the railroad system, or the telegraph
                    wires. It was a mixture of “Wes, we weren't independent, but you are a big
                    country and we are a small country.” You have to remember that one of the things
                    in Nicaraguan history, and I've forgotten exactly when this was, is that they
                    petitioned the U.S. Congress to become a state at one time.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you sensing when you were there, that the Sandinistas really weren't
                    getting the hearts and minds of the people as much as they thought they had,
                    because within a relatively short period of time they had an election. When was
                    the election?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I can't remember. It wasn't that long ago. I don't thinthey lasted ten
                    years. It was maybe '88.</p>
                <p>Q: Anyway they had an election and they thought they were going to win and they
                    sure as hell didn't. I was wondering whether we sensed any of that or not
                    because this revolution was portrayed as popular, Somoza was awful, and
                    therefore these guys are good, and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I was not in Nicaragua at the time but I was still following it and I
                    was still keeping in touch with people down there. I don't think there was any
                    question at all that the Sandinistas thought that they were going to win. I
                    don't think that there is any question that a lot of people in the U.S.
                    government thought they were going to win too. I think the Sandinistas were
                    overestimating their popularity, and I think the United States government was
                    overestimating the control that the Sandinistas had. They thought they could
                    flip a switch and say, 92 percent voted for us, as we have seen in a lot of
                    other elections. They both turned out to be wrong. We certainly worked for it
                    and we poured money into there sort of harking back to earlier elections in
                    Italy where we poured money and influence.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>I think clearly that what happened was that people didn't like Somoza, but they
                    didn't like what the Sandinistas were doing either. They wanted somewhere in
                    between. Violetta Chamorro who was a very popular figure, turned out not to be
                    such a tremendous politician when she subsequently became president, but she was
                    considered to be a very honest woman, an honorable woman.</p>
                <p>I think that Daniel Ortega was kind of a stiff figure. I saw him many times at
                    popular rallies and so on. Tomas Borge, whom I've mentioned a number of times,
                    was much more of a charismatic figure within the revolution and could draw more
                    emotion from the crowd than either of the Ortega brothers who were much more in
                    the forefront of the revolution. I think a lot of factors led to their downfall.
                    They are still around, but they certainly haven't come back and I think they
                    thought they would.</p>
                <p>Q: Part of your work is always to reach groups in a country, friendly or what
                    have you. Did you feel that there were any groups that you could try to
                    reach?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I mentioned going out to the universities and we did try to do that as
                    much as we could possibly do. We weren't allowed to do a lot of speaking
                    engagements in the universities, so we would meet with small groups of students
                    and professors. I thought that was effective. We tried to do cultural events.
                    Occasionally we would be allowed to bring down a performing group and stage it,
                    but there weren't a lot of cultural activities, period. The Sandinistas
                    continued to have popular cultural rallies like, if you remember, the L'Unita
                    fiestas in Italy, in which they would have a fair and that kind of
                    entertainment. There wasn't a lot of highbrow entertainment, but jazz groups and
                    things like that we would try to bring down.</p>
                <p>We would try to reach the people through the media, as I mentioned, and there I
                    think we were relatively successful; more successful than I thought possible.
                    Another indication of that uncertainty of Sandinista control and the grayness of
                    devotion to the Sandinista cause, even from people in such important positions
                    as the head of Sandinista radio stations and the head of Sandinista television
                    stations, was that they wouldn't find an excuse not to interview an Otto Reich.
                    They would be either persuaded or bullied by us saying, “You've got to let this
                    man have his say; you can rebut him if you want to, but let him get on.” So I
                    think in a variety of ways we reached out.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>In other ways it was difficult because it wasn't a greatly developed country, and
                    that would have been the case under Somoza or under the Sandinista regime. I
                    traveled as much as I could. The east coast, the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua,
                    which was an area which had been populated largely by former slaves, was an area
                    of resistance to the Sandinistas, more so than the more urban area. Therefore we
                    were never allowed to travel to the east coast. There were certain areas of the
                    country that we were cut off from, but we were not restricted, as we certainly
                    were in the Soviet Union, in that we didn't have to get permission to travel; we
                    could go out to places. In one embarrassing incident for me, I ended up in a
                    port city on the morning after the Contras had blown up some of the facilities
                    there. I had to answer a lot of questions about “Who knows, and why am I
                    here?”</p>
                <p>Q: What was the feeling in the embassy towards the Contra war?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Well, you talk about gray shades again. Arturo Cruz was a highly
                    respected intellectual and former businessman who was part of the Contra cause.
                    The embassy tried to work as closely with him as we could while he was still in
                    the country and we encouraged people, once he left the country, to work with
                    him. I think the embassy attitude was that there were contras, which means
                    against, opposition to the Sandinista regime like Violetta Chamorro who would
                    certainly never call herself a Contra and never actively endorsed the violence
                    of the Contra resistance. These were areas that we encouraged more collaboration
                    and cooperating with. The more militaristic side of things is something which
                    was not organized directly by any of the areas that we were working with in
                    Nicaragua at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it pretty much understood that the Nicaraguans were
                        involvein El Salvador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes. I don't think there is any question about it. On a couple of
                    occasions when intelligence was released saying “Here's what happened; here's a
                    map,” the Sandinistas would admit it to the extent of saying, “Well, it
                    happened, but we didn't instigate it, or we didn't bless it,” and they would
                    sort of fudge it in that way. They were certainly sympathetic to the FMLN, there
                    was no question of that. The FMLN was also divided. I didn't know as much about
                    how they were organized as I did about what was going on in Nicaragua, but there
                    was not one centralized command and in that way the Sandinistas could sort of
                    pick and choose which element or faction of the FMLN they would support</p>
                <p>Q: What about while you were doing this, this obviously had very high priority,
                    did you feel that, of course it was in hostile territory, but was USIA putting a
                    lot of resources into Nicaragua that they could use?</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: In terms of the resources that I could use, it was tremendous. I never
                    had a question. Anything I asked for, I could get away with. The resources that
                    weren't brought to bear, and I think that up to a certain level within USIA I
                    was supported, was in an effort to get a Fulbright exchange program going, as I
                    said. The money never came because the program was never approved. Anything that
                    I could do, yes, the resources were there.</p>
                <p>Q: How about while all of this was going, was there an active Nicaraguan students
                    going kind of on their own with their families up to the United States getting
                    an education and then coming back?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Much less so than had been the case in the past. The Chamorro family,
                    for example, had all been educated outside of Nicaragua, mostly in Canada. It is
                    an interesting choice for a family to decide that they were going to be educated
                    overseas, but they wouldn't choose the States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It makes good political sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Exactly. A lot of the families who had the wherewithal to send their
                    kids overseas were out of the country by that time. I lived in an absolutely
                    fabulous house which I've never lived in before or since with a swimming pool
                    and a garden. This belonged to a family which had fled the country. They had
                    fled voluntarily; they weren't forced out. As I mentioned earlier, some people
                    were forced out if the commandantees coveted a certain house. A lot of the
                    wealthier families who would have sent their kids to school were not in the
                    country anymore. They were riding it out in Miami, or New York, or other places.
                    There was not a lot of income coming in for people at the time so it was
                    difficult to continue the flow that had taken place in the Somoza years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel the fine hand of Charlie Wick, the head of
                        USIA,while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Wick was the head of USIA during the eight years of Ronald Reagan, and
                    this was certainly during that time. No, to be honest with you, the resources
                    were there, but I dealt more directly with the Latin American area of the U.S.
                    Information Agency at the time, and there was never any question of support. To
                    be quite honest with you, I can't even remember if Wick came to Nicaragua during
                    that time. We certainly had some high level visitors, as I mentioned, who came
                    down, Kissinger and others. Wick came to Italy when I was there on a couple of
                    occasions, and he certainly put his hand very actively in when he was interested
                    in doing things like setting up WorldNet television, but those sorts of things
                    were not going on in Nicaragua.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about while you were there was the CIA, because it was
                        ihostile territory, a quiet group or were they pretty active?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: They were a quiet group, in my observations. It was a small embassy. It
                    had been a small embassy before the revolution, but it was even smaller
                    afterwards. For example, after the earthquake in 1972, we had a very large AID
                    mission there, and that was completely closed down while I was there. I think
                    there were two people left when I arrived, the director of the AID mission and
                    one other person, and they closed it out entirely. So those missions within a
                    U.S. embassy overseas which tend to be large, were not there. The defense
                    attach�'s office, which had been large because we had been helping with the
                    Somoza military effort, was down to about three attach�s. They were occasionally
                    harassed but they were not ever forced out of the country.</p>
                <p>A number of people, including the political counselor, were declared persona non
                    grata. They were labeled as spies and we had to deny that and say, “You've
                    falsely accused these people and we protest their expulsion from the country.”
                    There was that kind of harassment, but in terms of the overall mission, it was a
                    small group, we all knew each other, and, as I mentioned earlier, in difficult
                    circumstances we came together. I can't remember what the size of the mission
                    was, but it was not a big one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much consultation or coordination, with our
                        embassiein El Salvador, Honduras, or Guatemala?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes, I think so. I certainly did. I also met pretty frequently with
                    Washington as well, meeting with U.S. Information Agency officials or other
                    officials, in either Miami or Washington. At least every three months or so I
                    would be in the States. I made several trips to Panama which is where the
                    Southern Command was located, for briefings, talks, and exchanges of
                    impressions, and so on, with the military. I traveled several time to Costa
                    Rica, El Salvador and to Honduras. The only country in the area that I didn't
                    get to while I was there was Guatemala and that was because I simply ran out of
                    time. There was a lot of consultation and my impression is the ambassador was
                    certainly back quite frequently for consultations, and the military attach�s
                    would go down to Panama on a regular basis.</p>
                <p>There was an effort to coordinate Central American policy. One of the things that
                    I'll mention a little bit later is one of the assignments that I had
                    subsequently in the research division of USIA, which does public opinion
                    polling. While I was in Nicaragua, my colleagues, my counterparts, the public
                    affairs counselors and others, would coordinate on formulating the questions
                    that would be asked of the populace so that we could compare what people in
                    Nicaragua are thinking as opposed to what people in Honduras are thinking about
                    the revolution in Nicaragua, about the revolution in El Salvador, that sort of
                    thing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Voice of America, was that very important there
                        or not,or other broadcasts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Voice of America was certainly there. We tried to ascertain, I think
                    rather consistently throughout the time I was there, just how much radio was
                    listened to. A lot of people didn't have electricity in the interior of the
                    country and so short-wave broadcasting, which a lot of people think is outmoded,
                    was important. I never really came to an honest conclusion on that. We
                    formulated programs, we would have frequent interviews with opposition leaders
                    when they were visiting the States on the Voice of America and broadcast it back
                    into the country. There were a couple of suspicions that the Sandinistas were
                    trying to jam the broadcast at times, but it might have been a generator which
                    had just gone on the blitz or something. I'm not sure they ever got that
                    organized.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in '84.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time how did you think things were going?
                        WhitheNicaragua?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I think we were still trying to be convince Washington that cooperation
                    could give us as many benefits as violent confrontation. The position I came to
                    back here was what I had asked for two years before. I was asked by Tony Motley,
                    who was the assistant secretary for Latin America at the time, to come back to
                    the State Department on detail and become the spokesman for the Latin American
                    region, for ARA at the time. My deputy had come directly out of El Salvador so
                    you can get some sense of what the whole Latin American region was focusing on
                    at the time.</p>
                <p>I thought that what I would try to do was to continue to spread the word that it
                    was a gray situation; that it was not a black and white situation; that there
                    were divisions among the Sandinistas; that there were people that we could work
                    with down there. I think the assumption is sort of like what it was with the
                    Soviet Union as late as maybe 1988 or so, that we are going to be dealing with
                    these people for a while and we might as well try to work with those elements
                    that can be more malleable. It became more difficult because after I came into
                    that position in the State Department, it became more violent; it became more of
                    a military situation than a negotiating situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back in '84 and you were with the ARA bureau at
                        thState Department from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: For a year until '85 when Tony Motley left and Elliot Abrams assumed
                    the assistant secretaryship. Most of my days were spent preparing press guidance
                    for the noon briefing for the press spokesman for the Department. In those days
                    we would coordinate very closely and have almost every morning a conference call
                    with the White House, the Defense Department, the State Department. We would
                    work out who was going to respond to which questions. As we used to joke, if it
                    was good news, the White House will announce it; if it was bad news, flip to
                    State and let them handle it.</p>
                <p>Almost every afternoon we did backgrounding, talking with journalists who were
                    covering Latin America very closely at the time. Some of them I had known in
                    Latin American, and some of them covered the State Department for years. It was
                    an awful lot of hair splitting and analysis, and just general backgrounding on
                    what had come out in the morning, either the guidance that had been prepared for
                    the briefings, or what had been announced in the briefings.</p>
                <p>I found it a difficult year because as I said I thought that the policy, in my
                    opinion, was gearing more and more towards the military. Quite frankly I sat
                    down and had a heart to heart talk with the new assistant secretary, Elliot
                    Abrams, who asked me to stay on. I asked him, “What's coming?” and he said more
                    military. I said, “I'd not like to stay, thank you,” and that was that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the press corps working with
                        thState Department during this '84 to '85 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I was very impressed with the State Department press corps. I thought
                    they were a very professional group. On occasion I would have to deal with the
                    White House press people. I hold the State Department press corps in much higher
                    esteem. The White House has to cover everything. Not only domestic policy, but
                    the first lady eating in Omaha today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And highly politicized.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes, and highly politicized, and very domestically oriented. I was a
                    Foreign Service officer. I am interested in international affairs. The press
                    corps in the State Department is interested in it, too. They are knowledgeable,
                    and they are good. I came to know some of them quite well and trusted them. I
                    think that this is kind of the background situation that you can have. Almost
                    every afternoon I was on the phone at great length with a lot of the journalists
                    giving more detail or nuances to what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '85 where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: In '85, I went to the office of research at USIA. It is heavily
                    concentrated on foreign public opinion polling. They don't directly conduct it
                    themselves, but they commission foreign polling organizations to conduct polls
                    within every country that we can get into, that we are allowed into, to ask
                    Russian citizens what they think of U.S. relations, or what they think of
                    Brezhnev, or whatever, however sensitive you can get.</p>
                <p>I went over as a director of the European area. After I had been there for less
                    than a year, the director of the research office, who was a political appointee,
                    asked me to become his deputy director. Traditionally, as is often the case in
                    the Foreign Service, sometimes the director was a career person; in this case,
                    he was a political appointee and he asked a career officer to be his deputy. We
                    would take these raw polls and the analysts in each of the geographic regions
                    would study them, put them in a context and say, this is the way the question
                    was put; this is what they think in Nicaragua; this is what they think in
                    Honduras. They would do charts and graphs.</p>
                <p>A lot of the time nobody pays the slightest bit of attention to it. On one
                    occasion though, I had to go over to the White House and work with Larry Speakes
                    who was doing a briefing on the results of a poll done throughout Central
                    America on the attitude towards the Sandinistas. It got right to the White House
                    level because it was what they wanted to hear. It was legitimate. We didn't skew
                    the results. The results showed that a lot of people in Central America were
                    very concerned about the Sandinista regime.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought that for a person who as been as active as you had been,
                    since the polls were farmed out to other people and all, this would be a good
                    solid administrative job, and that you would have been somewhat restive.</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Well, we did a lot of editing and that was the fun part of it. The
                    analysts would do their drafting. Most of the people were civil servants with a
                    strong background in public opinion polling, so the drafts were kind of dull
                    when they got to us. We tried to put it into the kind of language and the kind
                    of presentation that would interest political people on the Hill, or in the
                    White House, or at the State Department. I enjoyed doing that. It was fun to try
                    to take a rather straightforward product that was presented to us and to put it
                    in a context that would be exciting, sexy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about some of the areas. Were you able to do
                        opiniopolls in the Soviet Union, or China, or places like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Most of them were very limited in the Soviet Union at the time, and in
                    China. A lot of them would be done with either �migr�s or people who were
                    traveling. They wouldn't always necessarily be done scientifically in this case.
                    There would be interviews with people that would then be construed to convey
                    public opinion. We did a lot of what we called focus group studies as well,
                    which aren't scientific public opinion polls either, where you get a group of
                    people around a room, have a discussion, and then follow the train of thought
                    from that. There was legitimate criticism, I think. It wasn't all scientific. We
                    were looking for particular things of interest to the foreign policy
                    establishment and would try to get at it any way we could. They did public
                    opinion polling in Hong Kong because a lot of Chinese flowed in and out of Hong
                    Kong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Wick during that time, was he very interested
                        in whayou all were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: He was interested. Wick had come from a Hollywood background and from a
                    very public media background, so he was always more interested in television, in
                    the programmatic aspects of USIA. Getting WorldNet was one of his wonderful
                    ideas that he had been able to persuade the President, Ronald Reagan, (close
                    family ties there) to support. He felt that this was one way we were going to
                    win hearts and minds, by beaming television programs into countries all over the
                    world. I think that his idea at one point had been to do it by satellite so that
                    you could directly go into countries. As you will recall, the Soviets were very
                    worried about this. This was part of the whole freedom of information versus
                    interference in internal activities debate that was going on with the Helsinki
                    Accords. I think he was more interested in that aspect of USIA programs than he
                    was in more scientific polling. But if the White House was interested in it,
                    then Charlie Wick was interested in it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Interestingly enough, I was approached by a few of the correspondents
                    and journalists that I had been in touch with; Roy Gutman, for example, from
                    Newsday was writing a book at the time. But I left in '85 and sort of moved out
                    of direct involvement in the area.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned, I was detailed over to the National Security Council on two
                    occasions, but it wasn't with Latin America, even though I would see old
                    colleagues and friends that I had worked with. One time was for Reagan's first
                    meeting with Gorbachev in Geneva to handle the press aspects of that, and the
                    other time was because I had a background in Italy. It was for a G-7 conference
                    in Venice. Even though I was back, and on a couple of occasions would see Ollie
                    North, on those occasions it wasn't in a Latin American context.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Italy from '88 to when? CALLAWAY: Until '92,
                        another four years.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: It means all of the bi-national, educational, cultural programs, and
                    exchanges. Not only bi-national, but in some cases multinational. For example,
                    Italy is extremely rich, both intellectually and culturally, and in many
                    instances it gets along just fine without official government involvement. A lot
                    of the programs that we had there were facilitated. We would help the Venice
                    Bienalle in which the U.S. has a pavilion, but we were not providing the bulk of
                    the funding for it at all. We would help organize a symphony orchestra visit, or
                    an exchange of artists between the two countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>One of the areas where I was very heavily involved was the Fulbright exchange
                    commission, and that is very big in Italy. There it is basically the two
                    governments. One of the aspects though, particularly during that time, and I
                    don't know if the word was in use then, but privatization was moving in, in
                    which we were trying to move away from government support for educational and
                    cultural programs, to get more private sector involvement. We worked very hard
                    to get both U.S. companies, mainly based in Europe or Italy like American
                    Express, IBM, and others, or Italian companies which were interested in helping
                    people get a further education, and to persuade them that this would benefit
                    their own company in the future. Grantees might come back and work for them; a
                    broader international education was a good thing for both countries and a good
                    thing for their companies.</p>
                <p>We sent several hundred students and professors in each direction, each year on
                    the Fulbright exchange program. The whole selection process and where they are
                    going to be placed in each country, was something that involved the bi-national
                    commission very much. We would be meeting at least several hours each week to
                    discuss what programs we would sponsor in the future, what institutions we would
                    deal with, and who would be selected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see a difference in American-Italian
                        relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I did indeed toward the end of that time because this was just when the
                    old post-war regime in Italy, which we all knew and loved, or at least were
                    familiar with, was beginning to crumble. There were investigations into
                    corruption and how the political parties had all, without exception, raked off
                    funds from various deals with business to support their activities, and how
                    judges mainly based in the Milan area were beginning to have a tremendous amount
                    of power to investigate high ranking politicians and businessmen. There were a
                    series of suicides and resignations that came out of this. This was all just
                    beginning to happen.</p>
                <p>We had dealt with Italy since 1945, and in some instances since 1943, on the
                    basis of the Christian Democrats being natural allies and the Communist Party of
                    Italy being natural enemies. All that began to fall apart. The Communist Party,
                    whose headquarters was one block away from where I lived in the center of Rome,
                    had re-designated itself as the party of the democratic left. They had taken the
                    hammer and sickle from being a center part of their emblem, and put it down at
                    the bottom of a tree as sort of a seed.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: No, the rose was the Socialist Party symbol. This was of a spreading
                    oak tree to show that they were growing beyond their roots. A lot of the
                    officials that we dealt with (I earlier mentioned Radio-Television Italy) were
                    political appointees. I noted that the three major radio and television networks
                    were Christian Democratic, socialist, and communist. The same was true for
                    cultural institutions that we dealt with - they were largely political
                    appointees. Now these people were losing their jobs; they were very concerned
                    about their futures.</p>
                <p>A lot of the contacts that we had began to get either shaky or be gone. These
                    were people that we worked with in setting up the art show in Venice, or at the
                    Ministry of Culture in trying to arrange more exchange programs, or blocking the
                    illicit sale of Italian art which had been exported out of the country, or at
                    the Ministry of Education where we were trying to help the Italians establish a
                    junior college system. From '88 to '92, it was moving in that direction. It was
                    fascinating to watch, and it is still fascinating to watch it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador in this '88 to '92 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: When I first went back, believe it or not Maxwell Rabb was still there.
                    I went out with Rabb, came back with Rabb, and for one year he was still there.
                    I think that Max Rabb really thought that with George Bush being elected as
                    president, he was going to stay on for yet another four years. I think he was a
                    terribly disappointed man that it didn't work out that way. After a lot of
                    rumors he was replaced by a fellow named Peter Secchia. Secchia was a Republican
                    businessman from Michigan who had been very influential in George Bush's
                    campaign in helping George Bush win the nomination. By the name, he had an
                    Italian background, but he did not speak Italian. I think it was his grandfather
                    who had come over and established himself well. He was mainly a political
                    advisor and a political donor to the Bush campaign. He was more of a purely
                    political appointee than I had dealt with before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been given a rather rough time by the American
                        presbefore he came out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes, and after he got there, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As being very crude and just not up to diplomatic
                        standards, whatever those might be. You must have gotten involved in having
                        to deal with this didn't you, on the whole USIS side?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Right. As I had mentioned, Richard Gardner during his time had been
                    extremely involved on the intellectual, cultural, and educational side of
                    Italian-American affairs and had been very active. Maxwell Rabb in his eight
                    year tenure, was much less so, but still there were probably 50 American
                    educational institutions which had either summer programs or four year programs
                    in Italy, mostly based around Florence and Rome, but throughout the country.</p>
                <p>Secchia didn't come from this kind of background at all. On the Fulbright
                    exchange program he sort of said, “Let my wife do that.” He was a businessman
                    and a politician. In my opinion Peter Secchia did extremely well in those areas.
                    He did well in dealing with politicians and in dealing with businessmen. He did
                    less well when it came to the intellectual side, the cultural side of life.
                    Those of us who have served there know that this is very important in Italy. He
                    had a sort of “slap you on the back, and let's talk frankly” attitude. That went
                    over with some elements of the population that he dealt with, and much less with
                    others. Not speaking the language was a problem, though he tried very hard. But
                    it is difficult if you come at it especially with a background where people
                    expect you to speak. “Peter Secchia, you come from this little village up north
                    and don't speak our language?”</p>
                <p>Q: Did he understand what the problem was and try to work with you to say, okay,
                    this is the way I'm used to dealing but how should I deal here, and that type of
                    thing, or was it pretty much cleaning up after him?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I think that Secchia tended to realize his shortcomings and be almost
                    brutally honest about them at times. He wouldn't dismiss things that he didn't
                    know that well and feel that comfortable with. He wouldn't say that's not
                    important enough and I'm not going to support it. He just wouldn't be involved
                    in it. Often as you know, no matter what the program is, you want the
                    ambassador, the representative of the president, to be there at the opening of
                    this or that, and that is where it was difficult. It was difficult because he
                    felt uneasy. He felt that maybe a very erudite presentation would be given by
                    the Italian before him and the visiting American professor after him. It was
                    difficult to persuade him that sometimes just his presence was what was needed,
                    not necessarily his contributions. His wife was very active, a very dedicated
                    lady. She did sit on the Fulbright commission and was very active. She stood in
                    his place in many instances and did quite well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any major issues that you had to deal with why you were

                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: As I mentioned earlier when I was the press attach� about 10 years
                    before when we were putting the cruise missiles in, and now we were taking them
                    out. That was an issue which affected the entire mission. Even more important
                    were the political changes taking place in Italy. I can remember talking to a
                    very good friend of mine, the chief of the Los Angeles Times bureau, and him
                    saying, “I don't have any contacts any more. Everybody I know is either in jail,
                    dead, or out of the country.” This was across the board and I think this was a
                    difficult process not only at our embassy, but for all the people who had to
                    deal with the Italians, and the Italians themselves.</p>
                <p>I mentioned Joseph LaPalombara's book from Yale University, Democracy Italian
                    Style, I think is the title of the book. It is a very good description of how,
                    when you think Italy is going to fall apart any minute, it puts itself together.
                    This time, it really was falling apart in terms of the political
                    establishment.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there concern about criminal elements, corruption, that type of thing? Was
                    there a feeling that it was worse, better, drugs, the whole business?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: We talked earlier about the influence of the Red Brigades and the
                    danger that they posed and the fact that with a lot of cooperation Italy had
                    been able to pretty well overcome and defeat that threat. What they didn't
                    defeat and overcome was the Mafia. The Mafia continued to operate on various
                    levels. They continued to attack them, but some very high-ranking officials who
                    had dealt effectively with the Red Brigades were assassinated by the Mafia,
                    blown up in Sicily. Some of the accusations that were beginning to be made by
                    some of the judges against some of the old-line politicians were that they had
                    worked hand in glove with the Mafia throughout all these years, and that this is
                    the way that they had held it together; that it was a thoroughly corrupt system;
                    that they never really went after the Mafia. For example, one of the accusations
                    against Andreotti is that he had been responsible for the death of journalists
                    who were probing too far, and had been paid off directly by Mafia bosses in
                    Sicily.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned about reporting this back to Washington?
                        Werwe trying to sort of stay out of this whole thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: No, I think we were quite concerned. I mean Italy is important to us in
                    many aspects. It is one of the G-7, a charter member of the European Union, and
                    very important militarily. We have a lot of bases in Italy. The Soviet Union had
                    not collapsed yet so there was still concern. Libya, a constant concern to us,
                    is to the south of Italy. Some attacks had been made on some Italians by
                    Libyans, so there was a concern about terrorism. There was concern about drug
                    flow. A lot of aspects of it were of considerable concern to us about whither
                    Italy. I think we are still concerned. There is a book that I just started
                    reading recently called The Italian Guillotine, by Stan Burnett. I don't know if
                    you have his name or not.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The name is familiar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: He is another one worth talking with. Stan was the public affairs
                    counselor in Rome for part of my first tour there, and subsequently wrote this
                    book when he was at the Center for Strategic and International Studies here in
                    Washington, CSIS. He wrote it with an Italian co-author. It is a probing study
                    of just who some of these Italian judges are. Stan's basic thesis is that there
                    was a political motivation to what they were doing, too. They claimed to be
                    investigating corruption and going after anybody who is corrupt. His thesis is
                    that they didn't necessarily go after leftist corrupt officials. The former
                    Italian Communist Party, in other words which became basically the party of the
                    democratic left, was pretty well immune from these probings that went on,
                    whereas they went hammer and tongs after the Christian Democrats, the
                    republicans, the socialists, the liberals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you left, how was the Italian body politic
                        doing ithose days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Confusion, real confusion. There was real concern about where Italy was
                    going. I think we became a little more confident when Romano Prodi became the
                    prime minister. Berlusconi had become the prime minister at the time that I was
                    there. That was a confusing situation because he himself had been accused by
                    some of the magistrates of being involved with the Socialist Party. Craxi
                    himself, who was a former prime minister and head of the Socialist Party, had
                    been so pursued and accused by the judges that he had fled the country and still
                    lives in Tunisia.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of confusion whether Berlusconi was a new wave? He was a
                    businessman but he also held a lot of the private television stations as I had
                    mentioned. Had he used his television stations to unethically influence the
                    campaign? Then there were a series of others. There was a lot of confusion which
                    at times seemed to be cleared up but now we are seeing another period of
                    uncertainty.</p>
                <p>Q: You were dealing with the cultural field, were you feeling any change in the
                    role of America in Europe, in Italy, and vice versa? Had this changed at all or
                    were we less the center?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I think the move toward Europe as an entity was progressing right
                    along. In '88 you had Gorbachev and you had moves towards perestroika and
                    glasnost. I think there was a feeling that things were really happening in
                    Europe; that there could be an entity in Europe to deal with a changing Soviet
                    Union. I don't think anybody thought about the demise of the Soviet Union at the
                    time. I think the United States was still terribly popular with jazz, music,
                    blue jeans, and McDonalds, which a lot of people in Italy opposed strongly. You
                    probably remember when the first one went in, “We'll never accept this!” It's
                    probably one of the most popular restaurants in Rome now.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes. The Italian movie industry is terribly important. There is an area
                    that we dealt a lot with. We tried very hard to have more cooperation between
                    Italian movie companies and American movie companies. The MPAA sold an awful lot
                    of movies in Italy but there was concern about piracy because some of the movies
                    there would make their way into places like China and the Soviet Union where
                    piracy laws and restrictions are much less followed. There was a lot of
                    cooperation, a feeling that Europe itself was becoming more important in its own
                    right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '92 you took off from Italy again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Again, yes, sadly, reluctantly. They dragged me out othere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: This was very different. I came back to Washington. I had been asked by
                    the deputy director of the U.S. Information Agency to be his executive
                    assistant. It was a small office. There was the deputy director, his assistant,
                    and two secretaries; that was it. We were right in the front office with the
                    director of the U.S. Information Agency whose office wasn't much bigger than
                    that. He had seven people working with him. I came back and it was still the
                    Bush administration. Eugene Kopp was a political appointee, but he had been a
                    political appointee three times at USIA. He had served longer in USIA than many
                    of the Foreign Service officers had been there. He liked the place. He respected
                    it. He worked very closely with the establishment, and with the career people. I
                    became his deputy for one year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the director of USIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: The director at that time was Henry Cato, who had beeBush's ambassador
                    in Great Britain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been ambassador to Costa Rica?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: It was Central America somewhere. He had been chief of protocol at the
                    State Department. He had a distinguished career. He was a wealthy man from Texas
                    and had been asked by Bush to take the place of probably the only director in
                    recent history that I never met, Bruce Gelb, who had been a wealthy businessman
                    who just didn't work out.</p>
                <p>Q: You were back there after the Wick period and I've had people, Ted Kern and
                    others, talk about how Wick was very difficult to deal with because he had a
                    very low tolerance for information and you had to deal with him in a certain
                    way. At the same time this guy was so good with Reagan that he could get all the
                    money he wanted so that you were awash with money, more or less. When he left,
                    that cornucopia sort of dried up. How did you find it sort of in the post-Wick
                    era?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I heard more tales, as you have, than directly experienced them. There
                    had been a family relationship between the Wicks and the Reagans and it not only
                    was the men, but it was the two wives, Mrs. Reagan and Mrs. Wick, who were
                    perhaps even closer. Like you say, he could call him up and say, “Ron, I want to
                    build WorldNet. Put me in for another 200 million.”</p>
                <p>I don't know what Cato's relationship with Bush was at all except being rewarded
                    by going to the Court of St. James, which was a pretty nice reward. It was much
                    more of a formal relationship with the White House. I think we were still
                    relatively well funded compared to what was to come later, certainly in times
                    that I experienced as we moved into the Clinton administration, but it wasn't
                    that personal tie, or “Fine, Charlie, you do whatever you like.” It was more of
                    a formal relationship as a political appointee, head of an agency, and not the
                    prime foreign agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the issues that you and your principal
                        werparticularly involved with during this year, '92 to '93?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I came back in August and it was elections; basically that was it. It
                    was preparing for another Bush administration and all the hopes. One of the
                    issues as we went into that fall was consideration of what the future of radios
                    was going to be. By now the Soviet Union was gone. Do we need Radio Liberty and
                    Radio Free Europe any more? Do we need the Voice of America? Should we combine
                    them? The issues that we are looking at today, and it was first resolved one
                    way, and then it was resolved another. Should the Voice of America break away
                    from USIA and become part of an international board of broadcasting? Should
                    Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe be abolished entirely or brought in under
                    the umbrella?</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>That was the issue that was going on even as the elections were going on. It
                    didn't become one of the major election issues at all, but certainly one of the
                    issues. USIA was the parent agency of Voice of America at the time, and was
                    having a lot of influence over RL, RFE, Radio Marti, and TV Marti. There were
                    constant accusations from the Hill about those two being totally ineffective,
                    especially Television Marti, and being heavily influenced by the Cuban-American
                    community down in Miami. A deceased man by the name of Jorge Mas was accused by
                    the democrats of being the sole boss of the Marti radios. All those were issues
                    that were concerning us as we moved into the elections of '92, which by November
                    became less of a concern to the current administration.</p>
                <p>Q: Charlie Wick had put a lot of emphasis on WorldNet. Could you explain what it
                    was and by the time that you got back, about how you felt about its
                    effectiveness?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: WorldNet was an effort to establish something akin to the Voice of
                    America, a television arm of the United States government which would either
                    have direct satellite broadcasts into countries, or placement on local stations
                    of television programs or collaborative television programs which would tell
                    America's story. It was the old USIA slogan, present American culture, or
                    American education, or American history, so that people would know about the
                    United States.</p>
                <p>Wick was very interested in having direct interviews. When we couldn't get an
                    interview with the secretary of Defense about a particular policy with RAI
                    television, Mr. Wick wanted to put it on WorldNet. We would gather a group of
                    journalists in a studio either in the embassy or in one of the studios that we
                    had paid for at an Italian television station, and have them ask questions by
                    long distance satellite. It would not be a press generated event so much as an
                    embassy or a USIA generated event. Wick's idea was that we want to get the story
                    out and we want to get it out by the latest means possible, so let's move into
                    television.</p>
                <p>I think it was effective. I mentioned how hundreds of television stations were
                    springing up as Italy moved away from a state monopoly over the television and
                    radio. These people were desperately hungry to have something to broadcast and
                    we could accommodate them. In other cases, where we were dealing with a lot of
                    competition in free democratic information societies, it was less effective. It
                    was a big effort of his and it was very controversial on the Hill. A lot of
                    people criticized it and said it amounted to absolutely nothing. I think in a
                    lot of cases people were trying to feather their nests and their careers by
                    exaggerating the figures. Charlie Wick wanted to hear big figures about how many
                    people were watching WorldNet.</p>
                <p>I will go back to one of my earliest recollections as a junior officer back when
                    I first came in, we had a thing called PPBS, Planning Programming Budgeting
                    Systems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't it a matrix thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: This was the thing that McNamara had established, cost effectiveness
                    and so on at the Pentagon. The director of USIA at the time decided, “We are
                    going to do this here. We are going to do this in USIA.” It was very, very
                    difficult to say if a fellow reads a book, is that one exposure, or a hundred,
                    or if he discusses a television program with somebody? They gave it to the
                    junior officers to put together. Exposures were the measurement. How effective
                    is all of this? I took some figures and worked at them very diligently and took
                    them into my boss down in Caracas, Venezuela. He looked at them and said,
                    “Double them.” Edward R. Murrow had a saying that it is very difficult to tell
                    when a man changes his mind; no light goes off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had WorldNet begun to sort of peter out by the time, at
                        the enof the Bush administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: It hadn't really petered out, but had much less focus on it. When Wick
                    left and first Gelb came in, and then Cato came in as the director of USIA, it
                    was still very much there but it was not that heavy focus with demand for
                    results and statistics that Wick wanted.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the attitude towards CNN, Ted Turner's commercial broadcast which was
                    the equivalent to a WorldNet which is really very U.S.? It is supposedly
                    international but people can certainly learn an awful lot of good and a lot of
                    bad about the United States by watching this. What was the USIA attitude?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I think there were two attitudes. One, as you say they can learn an
                    awful lot of good and bad. While WorldNet and all of USIA always claimed to be
                    honest and to present a diversity of views; the basic thrust was to present
                    obviously an overall favorable impression of a democracy with both good spots
                    and bad spots. The other thing was that CNN was seen as a crisis channel. If you
                    had a war going on then CNN was going to be on and people were going to watch
                    it. WorldNet and the USIA information programs were a continual educational
                    process. You didn't have to have bombs falling on Baghdad or Belgrade for your
                    television set to be turned on, but the programs would be produced throughout
                    and in that way a longer continuum of appreciation and knowledge about the
                    United States would be fostered. People today say, “What do you need any of
                    these for, you've got CNN?” Quite honestly people don't watch CNN when there is
                    nothing big going on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. In '93 there was a new Clinton administration in,
                        what foyou?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: There was a State Department officer, who had served as the
                    administrative counselor of the embassy in London with Henry Cato, by the name
                    of John Condayan, who had impressed Cato so much that he asked him to be the
                    head of the administrative management section of USIA. He brought him back from
                    London to fill in this position. John had been an administrative officer. He
                    knew very little about USIA but he had grown to appreciate and admire the agency
                    very much.</p>
                <p>As I understood it (I wasn't privy to these conversations.) the Bush people went
                    to the Clinton people and said, “Do you want to appoint a new director? What do
                    you want to do? Do you want to send somebody over here? Do you want a team?”
                    They just said, “No, you take care of it.” The Bush people decided that they
                    didn't want to stick around for that. I mean they stayed around until the
                    inauguration in January, but at that point they asked John Condayan, as the
                    highest ranking career person in USIA, to become the acting director. He was
                    acting director from January until roughly July, for half a year. I served as
                    long with John as I had with Gene Kopp. He was excellent. He was in a
                    transition, and not an easy one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a point where you got hit by the young activists
                        oClinton? The young activists seemed to be coming out of the woodwork.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes, they certainly started to come onboard even while John was still
                    acting director of the U.S. Information Agency. One, who was to become executive
                    assistant to the new director, who was not named at the time, came onboard. The
                    heads of various other offices within the agency also came on. The head of
                    congressional relations was very quickly appointed, and so on.</p>
                <p>That is why I admired Condayan so much. He was very even tempered about the whole
                    thing. He was a professional. He made no bones that he was not a USIA person, he
                    didn't have a long history, but he admired the institution and would try to work
                    as closely as he could with the new people. I think John was disappointed. I
                    think he hoped to stay on under the new administration and probably go back
                    again to being the head of the management. He was a careerist, a professional,
                    but he was a political appointee so it was “Bye, bye, John. He went back to the
                    State Department for a tour and is now retired.</p>
                <p>Joe Duffey, the new head of USIA, came onboard in May. He had been president of
                    American University, and president of the University of Massachusetts before
                    that. There was no deputy director so Condayan was acting. I was then the
                    executive assistant to John during that interim period. He stayed until July
                    when a political appointee, Penn Kimball, came in as deputy director.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>This was a difficult transition because there was a lot of debate over who would
                    become the director. Career people like Roz Ridgway were mentioned. Finally it
                    came down to Joe Duffey. He was persuaded to leave American University. The
                    Clinton connection goes way back to '63 or something like that, when Duffey ran
                    for the Senate in Connecticut. Clinton, as a young politico - I think he was
                    working on Senator Fulbright's staff at the time - went out and campaigned for
                    him. This was a long relationship.</p>
                <p>Penn Kimball had been with Freedom House, a private research organization which
                    studies foreign countries every year and does a survey about where they stand on
                    a dictatorship-to-democracy scale by various criteria such as free election, how
                    many officials had been arrested, that sort of thing. He had been very active
                    working for democracy in Central America. He had been on the board of directors
                    of Radio Liberty, Radio Free Europe, so he had some broadcasting background.</p>
                <p>Duffey mainly had an academic background. I think that they were seen as
                    balancing each other on the information and cultural side of things. Also on
                    political backgrounds, Duffey tended to be much more on the liberal side of the
                    Democratic Party, and Kimball more on the neo-conservative side of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do in July of '93?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: For three years, but under three different deputy directors, I
                    continued as executive assistant to the deputy director. I was interviewed by
                    Kimball. I thought for a while, as did my counterpart in the director's office,
                    that we were to be replaced by political appointees. Both of them thought about
                    it, and in both cases they asked the career people to stay on. The executive
                    assistant to the director who became Duffey's executive assistant was a career
                    civil servant and I was a career Foreign Service officer. They asked us both to
                    stay on.</p>
                <p>Basically what I did for the remaining two years was to introduce Penn Kimball to
                    the U.S. Information Agency. He had never worked for the government before; it
                    was always private sector, either political organizations or research
                    organizations, or some kind of association like Freedom House. They always
                    tended to be rather small organizations. He had never dealt with a large entity
                    with thousands of people like the U.S. Information Agency.</p>
                <p>It didn't work out this way between Kimball and Duffey at all, but traditionally
                    the director/deputy at USIA was sort of like the ambassador/DCM relationship.
                    The ambassador/director was the one who went to the Congress and dealt with the
                    White House, and the deputy director of the U.S. Information Agency ran the
                    place; he was kind of the deputy chief of mission, the management consultant.
                    They both needed to learn a lot about just what this organization was that they
                    were running. There was a lot of education.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>Q: I would have thought it would be a very difficult period because here is an
                    agency that had been living fairly well, and all of a sudden you were up, and it
                    wasn't just Clinton, it was Congress and everybody else, we were cutting back
                    and the agency was hit particularly hard. I would have thought that this team
                    that was put in place would be not well equipped to deal with this sort of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: There was a lot of anxiety. The basis of the argument was that the
                    Soviet Union had fallen, USIA was the Cold War propaganda arm of the U.S.
                    government, and it didn't really need to exist anymore. Why are we spending all
                    this money when we didn't have this big enemy out there anymore?The debate about
                    broadcasting continued to rage - will it be nothing, something, or totally out
                    of the agency? The whole matter of publications came up. We had a publication
                    called America that we distributed in the Soviet Union for years. Most of the
                    publications were disbanded or ceased to exist. For a few individual ones in
                    India and in Japan, the country budgets themselves continued to fund the
                    publications, but most of them were abolished over the anguished cries of people
                    in Africa who said they don't have television sets and we need publications. It
                    was an action which continued to be debated.</p>
                <p>There was then the whole question about whether USIA will cease to exist at all,
                    or will it be absorbed into the State Department, or will it be divided between
                    its information arm and its cultural arm? First was the effort by Senator Jesse
                    Helms, who with the Republican control of Congress became the chairman of the
                    Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who wanted to bring AID, USIA, and ACDA all
                    into the State Department and cut them back considerably as well. At first the
                    administration's decision was that this wasn't going to happen, and then
                    subsequently with more pressure being brought to bear, AID was brought more
                    directly under the control of the State Department, ACDA was absorbed, and USIA,
                    as of October 1, 1999 will be folded into the Department of State, which it was
                    before 1953.</p>
                <p>Q: Was the feeling that Jesse Helms' idea of cutting back USIA and putting it in
                    State Department was it just government efficiency or was it that he didn't like
                    USIA?</p>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Number one, I don't think it is false to say that Helms is concerned
                    about government efficiency, and that less government is better. I honestly
                    think that Helms has less esteem for AID than he does for USIA. I think that
                    Senator Helms' remarks about “give away” programs and U.S. foreign aid in
                    supporting foreign countries, as opposed to legitimate concerns about social
                    reform programs in his own country, are more strongly reflected in his attitudes
                    than a feeling of a continuing need for the United States government to have a
                    voice overseas. I think it was sort of half a loaf for him to win the battle for
                    ACDA and USIA and to only get a certain degree of control of AID, moved into the
                    State Department. I think Senator Helms probably has in mind that AID too will
                    go that way in the future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This must have been a rather difficult time morale wise
                        wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: Yes, it truly was especially in Washington. I think that in whatever
                    agency, esprit de corps, morale, is always higher overseas. You are on the front
                    lines whether it is a difficult post like Rome or a relatively easy post like
                    Moscow that you are dealing with. I think in DC you are dealing with more
                    bureaucratic things, and more administrative things. Yes, you do see the budget
                    cutting back. You see the whole rationale for USIA being questioned.</p>
                <p>Among people who worked at USIA, it was certainly not whether it would be
                    abolished or not; I don't think anybody was in favor of that. Those of us who
                    joined this agency appreciated and thought it had quite valuable the information
                    and cultural-educational programs. The question was whether it would go into the
                    State Department or not.</p>
                <p>Once again you had a spectrum. You had the diehards of “never, never,” and those
                    who felt this was the future and let's go full steam ahead. Many of us saw that
                    it was going to happen, that that is the way Congress was going to vote, and
                    after the administration had done a couple of flip flops, it was going to
                    support that.</p>
                <p>I think our basic concern was to what extent the culture of the Department of
                    State would be receptive to the kinds of programs that USIA ran? The concerned
                    attitude was, “State Department people are always crisis oriented; they are
                    always looking at the issue of the moment; they tend to focus on a political
                    solution and they don't look at the long run. They don't think about the
                    long-term impact of educational and cultural programs, and the need to have
                    those.” The fear is that if resources need to be shifted then they will be
                    shifted away from those longer-term efforts.</p>
                <p>The positive attitude is that the appreciation for long-term and short-term
                    political, cultural, economic educational programs will all stay in place and
                    that the argument for a more consistent policy in carrying out U.S. foreign
                    policy under one roof will make logical sense and also bring about some fiscal
                    savings, which I think the Congress was certainly looking for.</p>

                <p>CALLAWAY: I had experience in Latin America and had enjoyed tremendously being
                    the cultural attach� in Rome, and the cultural attach� position in Madrid was
                    coming open. I had some high-ranking contacts at that time so I said that's
                    where I want to go and that's what I want to do. In the summer of '95 I went off
                    to Madrid as the cultural attach�.</p>

                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>CALLAWAY: I was there from '95 to '96, one year. Several things were happening.
                    This was the year, as you will recall, that the government closed down. It was
                    yet another year in which, as we had mentioned earlier, the resources and
                    programs of USIA were being curtailed greatly. What we were doing was closing
                    down cultural centers, closing down libraries, letting loyal and faithful
                    Foreign Service national employees go. When the crisis of the government totally
                    closing down around the end of '95/'96 happened, I was actually the acting
                    public affairs counselor. My immediate boss was back on home leave in the States
                    and I was suddenly dealing with all this stuff. I went home one day and said to
                    my wife, “I am dismantling everything I have worked for years to build up.
                    Before I become a bitter old man, I think I am going to retire.”USIA had been
                    offered a transition course, what was called a career transition course at the
                    State Department. They had informed us that because USIA was probably going out
                    of existence, this would be one of the last times that we could opt for this
                    program. There was a friend of mine that I had worked with in educational
                    exchange programs, who was back in Washington and who had set up a private
                    organization, and he said, “Why don't you come back and work with me?” I told my
                    wife, “It looks like the stars are crossing.” Reluctantly, from the point of
                    view of Spain which we enjoyed tremendously, and the programs which we were
                    cutting back, I decided now is the time to retire. It was 30 years and a few
                    months. I announced reluctantly to my boss who told me, “You go tell the
                    ambassador. I'm not going to tell him that you are leaving.” I came back in the
                    summer of '96 and retired from the Foreign Service and went to work with
                    FEMA.</p>
