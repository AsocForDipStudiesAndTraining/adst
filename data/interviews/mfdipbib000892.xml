                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: May 19, 1992</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you'd give me a bit about your background?
                        Where and when you were born, and about your education.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Yes, I was born in Washington, DC, one of these rarities. So the idea of a
                    government career came rather naturally. I attended local universities, George
                    Washington, American University, and Georgetown University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You almost touched all of them, except Catholic University
                        ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Exactly. Actually, I got my B.A. from American, and my Masters degree in
                    History from Georgetown. I decided early on that I wanted a career in the
                    Foreign Service. However, before doing that I went to work for something called
                    Foreign Broadcast Information Service, FBIS, and served a two year tour overseas
                    in the early 1950s, 1951 to 53. Served in Japan with the Foreign Broadcast
                    Information Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an integral part of the Foreign Affairs
                        establishment. What was your impression of the FBIS operation in Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>OWENS: Well, it was a rather effective organization. As you know, the Foreign
                    Broadcast Information Service was subsumed by the Central Intelligence Agency,
                    and it was by the time I joined it. Our essential duties there were to listen to
                    the foreign broadcasts from the communist transmitters in Beijing, Moscow, and
                    Pyongyang, North Korea. We had translators who would translate the broadcasts
                    and we would try to make sense out of them in terms of indicating what communist
                    Soviet or Chinese intentions were. It was a relatively raw and undeveloped
                    science, if one can call it that, at that time. I think the genesis of the
                    program was the invasion of Korea by the Chinese army in 1950, after the US
                    troops had approached the Yalu River, at which time the Chinese, Beijing forces
                    entered the fray. In retrospect, it was felt that had the US been more closely
                    following the signals from Beijing, it would have been understood that there was
                    a very serious threat of Chinese communist intervention. So, the purpose of
                    monitoring their broadcasts was to determine patterns, changes, and themes, and
                    any indications that there were harbingers of developments to come. So while I
                    was there, however, I took the Foreign Service examination in 1953 at the
                    American Embassy in Tokyo. We, who were working in an organization such as FBIS
                    were very envious of our State Department colleagues who were able to discuss
                    what they were doing, lived in a seemingly open world of diplomacy in contrast
                    to the more covert type of activities we were engaged in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a three and a half day exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I took the same one in Frankfurt. I was ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: In '53 also?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '53 I was a GI in the Air Force as an enlisted
                        man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: In what year did you come in then?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I came in in '55.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: That's what I did, actually. I had not realized that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, going back. You were in Washington, what was your
                        family involved in. I was wondering, to give a feel for the ...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>OWENS: Yes. My father was a government worker. He had worked for the Veterans
                    Administration. Very traditional, an 8 to 5 job. He was an immigrant from
                    Ireland, actually. He had come as a very young man to the United States, studied
                    for the priesthood in Ireland, and washed out for whatever reason, and came over
                    about 19, and worked various jobs for the government. He had a job as an escort
                    officer for the Immigration and Naturalization, the equivalent of that time. One
                    of his jobs was ferrying prisoners or people who were being expatriated back to
                    their home countries, and studied at night, and so had a very ordinary immigrant
                    history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you come in to any State Department contacts at all
                        when you were in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Not really, very little. I guess my greatest exposure was in Tokyo. This
                    was during the American occupation of Japan. So it was still under military
                    control. General MacArthur had just turned it over to General Ridgway by the
                    time I arrived. But I was caught up socially with diplomats as well as with army
                    people, so I became rather fascinated by the diplomatic service. I can't say
                    that I knew very much about it before...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came in to the Foreign Service in '55. You came in
                        with training...a junior officer class...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: I was one of those who unfortunately did not join a class. There was a
                    need for officers, junior officers in the refugee relief program which was going
                    on at that time, and there was a clamor from Germany, from Italy, and from other
                    places, for officers to come out and issue visas. So I was immediately
                    dispatched. I had about a maximum of three weeks in the Department, just going
                    through processing, then was immediately sent to Naples into the “visa
                    factory.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain a bit about what the refugee program was
                        and the atmosphere of how you were dealing with it in Italy which was not a
                        site of major escaping from other places?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>OWENS: That's true. Italy, as you know, had suffered terribly during World War
                    II. The US and German forces fought over Italy in 1944, and into 1945. I guess
                    '43 was the invasion of Sicily, if I'm not mistaken. It seemed to us who were
                    young American consular officers, that, if they could, the entire population of
                    Italy would have moved to the United States. It seems strange to look back at it
                    from the vantage point of 1992, it is a very prosperous country, very high
                    standard of living, able to offer its citizens pretty much everything the United
                    States can today. But at that point, Italy was still not completely recovered
                    from the damage of war. The economy, although already starting to improve
                    significantly by the mid-nineteen fifties when I went there, was nevertheless
                    still not completely over from the wartime sufferings. So that we were working
                    with...actually there were thirty-five Vice Consuls assigned to Naples. I
                    remember a friend of my family's who lived in France, came to Naples. My family
                    was very proud that I'd become a Vice Consul in the US Foreign Service, and
                    asked for the Vice Consul, thinking that there was a Vice Consul, a Consul, a
                    Consul General...So the Italian receptionist looked at them and in a bored voice
                    said: “Well, which one of the thirty-five do you mean, Sir?” which he related
                    when he came into my office. And I say my office...we all had desks in large
                    offices. We were not in the main consular building, which you later...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think it was even built at that time...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Yes, I think it was, it was just about that time. We were up on Via Orazio
                    at that time, in something called the visa annex, which was a several story
                    building set up against the hills quite up the Via Orazio, and there we
                    interviewed the Italians who were hoping to go to the United States...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was called the Refugee Relief Program, and I speak
                        from the historian's viewpoint, because I was doing exactly the same work in
                        Frankfurt at this time. It implies that these people were refugees from some
                        place. How did you rationalize...you were in Italy and these were people who
                        were refugees, and they were in Italy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: That's true, and as was the case in Germany, so many homes had been
                    destroyed that it was easy to get ... this was a requirement that you submit an
                    affidavit that your home, or farm, or rooms, in which you lived had been
                    destroyed during the war, and that you were not able to recover that property
                    intact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that you were taking a law which
                        was designed essentially for refugees, really talking about people who were
                        fleeing the Soviet behind the Iron Curtain, and were twisting it in order to
                        meet the imperatives of political life in the United States, i.e. a
                        Congressman who had Italian constituents and all that...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>OWENS: I think in retrospect, yes. At the time, I was not particularly conscious
                    of that. It just seemed that it was the job we were assigned to do and we wanted
                    to carry it out in the most effective way possible. We all, I think, knew that
                    we would not be in the program for too long because it had an expiration date,
                    and as a matter of fact by 1956 most of the junior officers at the Consulate
                    were transferred, as I was. By the end of '56 we all received orders to more
                    normal Foreign Service assignments. But, at that time, I would say at least for
                    myself, we weren't thinking in those broader foreign policy and domestic policy
                    terms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe it was more obvious, when I was in Frankfurt or
                        maybe the spirit was, but I developed, it probably is not the right term, a
                        certain, if not contempt for the law, at least a feeling, well there are
                        laws and laws, and I thought we were doing good work, because I thought
                        these were obviously people who needed to go somewhere, but at the same time
                        you didn't look too closely at the letter of the law and in a way it served
                        me well later on, but you can always lead to trouble, if you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: That's very true. But, as I say, at least I didn't think too much...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came to a more traditional place. Your next
                        posting from 1956 to about 1958, was where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Maracaibo, Venezuela. That was a more traditional posting. I was the No.2
                    officer in a 2 or 3 officer post. A small consulate on Lake Maracaibo. There was
                    much more protection and welfare, and American passport duties there. We had a
                    large number of people working in the oil fields around Lake Maracaibo, very
                    little visa issuance. There was another officer, he was a staff officer at the
                    time, as a matter of fact, he was Walt Silva, that you may or may not have
                    known.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, he was in Naples as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: He was taking the Foreign Service exam to become an FSO at the time. But
                    he was doing the visa work, and I was doing welfare and protection, and American
                    passports, and then we had a Consul who was in charge. But as luck would have
                    it, after the third position was eventually abolished, and then the Consul went
                    on home leave which was extended for a reason which I don' know, I was in charge
                    of the post for a very long period of time. This would be in 1958, at which
                    point a revolution occurred in Venezuela against the dictatorship of Perez
                    Jimenez. So for the first time in my then three-year-old Foreign Service career,
                    I had a chance of doing some political reporting. We were pretty well cut off
                    from the Embassy in Caracas. It was a rather exciting time because the Perez
                    Jimenez junta had established a curfew, a dawn to dusk curfew. It was rather an
                    exciting time and I enjoyed it immensely.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, here you are, a relatively junior officer, and
                        you're in charge of a post, and all of a sudden you've got the thing that
                        every Foreign Service Officer dreams of, a coup! I mean, we love coups. What
                        were you doing and how did you operate at this time. What was the
                        situation?</hi>

                <p>OWENS: Well, one of the problems was of course the large American community
                    there. One of the first issues was to provide for their safety and welfare,
                    which we were not in a particularly strong position to do. The oil companies
                    themselves were very strong institutions. They had their own security forces,
                    and their own infrastructure, but I did meet with the regional managers of the
                    various oil companies to pass on what little I knew, which was not very much. In
                    those days, we used a system of either couriers to take classified traffic up to
                    Caracas, which was then sent up to Washington, or commercial telegrams. In any
                    event, the Embassy was very interested in what was going on, so I sent a couple
                    of reports to Caracas, the very first political reports I had done in my career.
                    They seemed to like them, so I became more and more enthusiastic about that.
                    That was the focus of my activities. I had to, in a number of cases, move at
                    night during the curfew and I was given an identity card, a free pass which
                    enabled me to go through the lines of the troops. On a number of occasions I
                    came across road blocks where the troops were either illiterate and couldn't
                    read Spanish. I would explain—I spoke only fair Spanish—but I would explain that
                    I had a free pass, etc.. I remember the time when I had the first inklings of
                    danger when the troops who stopped me couldn't read and were eyeing me
                    suspiciously and were fingering their rifles. Fortunately, on one occasion, an
                    officer came on and looked at the pass and said: “Go on.” These were heady
                    times, and I enjoyed them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the result of this coup. Was Jimenez...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: He was ousted, and an interim government came in, Admiral Larasabo, and
                    later there were free elections, and Venezuela was launched on democracy. The
                    previous American Ambassador, Dempster McIntosh, who had been a political
                    appointee, I think he was the head of Westinghouse International, had gone to
                    great lengths in previous years to embrace Jimenez, and say that he didn't see
                    any evidence of corruption, or of despotic tendencies on the part of Jimenez,
                    but Jimenez was very unpopular with the Venezuelan people. It was during that
                    time, when I was in Maracaibo, when Vice President Nixon came to Venezuela and
                    was mobbed and almost didn't make it in one of his motor vans. That did not
                    directly impact us in Maracaibo, that was the far away capital. Road
                    transportation was twelve hours away. Of course, those were the years of piston
                    engine planes, there were no jets.</p>
                <p>In any event, as exciting as it was from reading about it in the press, (the
                    Nixon incident) it didn't have any impact on us.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OWENS: We had American sailors, since it was a port, a number of the sailors
                    would get into problems. We had to visit them in the jails, that was
                    interesting, and make sure they were treated as a Venezuelan citizen would be,
                    which in fact I would try to get a little better treatment than a citizen of
                    Venezuela would be given, since there were very few civil rights under the
                    dictatorship. In those times, maybe you still do, I don't know, we had to do the
                    inventories of the possessions of people who died without family there. There
                    were a number of Americans who would just sort of wash up on the shores and who
                    lived there for a number of years, older men who were drinking heavily and who
                    had Venezuelan girl friends. On a number of occasions, I remember, people in
                    that category died.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OWENS: They did. They did. That was my first identification with our knowledge of
                    the oil companies' operations. They, at that time, were trying to bring
                    Venezuelans into the work force and into the executive work force. I think that
                    was an early affirmative action program. I think they saw the handwriting on the
                    wall, and realized they would have to move to bring Venezuelans into the top
                    management. That was going on at the time.</p>

                        there was a terrible situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Yes. It was terrible. As you know, from being a consular officer yourself,
                    the Consulate always seemed to get the short end of the stick. Although we felt
                    the cost of living in Maracaibo was higher because there was less choice than
                    there was in Caracas, nevertheless, the per diem rates and the COLA, the cost of
                    living allowance, were much higher in the capital than they were in the
                    provinces. There were a couple of Consulates in Venezuela. There was one other,
                    I should say, in the east, at Pugrito la Cruz. But I think that all of the
                    Consular people felt that we were treated less favorably than the Embassy
                    personnel. So, it was extremely expensive. The allowances were not sufficient,
                    even for the hotels that were there. We were quite unhappy with the financial
                    arrangements. In fact, that was one of the reasons I wanted to get out. I stayed
                    only a year and a half. I was supposed to move to the ... Because I'd got to
                    know the people, the Deputy Chief of Mission and the Political Councilor in
                    Caracas at the time, I was supposed to move to the Political Section of the
                    Embassy. But when I came back on home leave, I found that I'd been detailed to
                    Greek training.</p>

                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>OWENS: That's right, Greece did. And I would say, even today, that was the high
                    point of my career in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this Greek training out of the blue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: No, I think I had, in the April fool's list, as we used to call it, the
                    April 1st's preference, you were asked to put down posts. I knew very little
                    about Greece, but I'd read a number of accounts of the Greek civil war, which
                    rather fascinated me. And I saw a Greek film at one of the oil companies in
                    Venezuela while I was serving there, of modern Greece, and it looked to me to be
                    a rather fascinating blending of east and west, at least what seemed to me then
                    of east and west. So I became rather interested, and put down that as a
                    preference. To my great surprise, because I came back, my effects were packed
                    when I left Maracaibo for transshipment to Caracas. When I got back in
                    Washington, I was told no, that assignment was canceled and I was going into
                    Greek training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For your first job, you went to Thessaloniki, is that
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Yes. Now I went through two years. At that time, they were having Greek
                    language and area training. The second year, my predecessor had decided that,
                    rather than go off to a university, which was the program, he would like to stay
                    and work in INR and on the desk, and get a year's experience as a trainee,
                    rather than go on to a university. That happened for me as well. It seemed at
                    the time and in retrospect, a lot of time spent in training, two years.
                    Particularly since you didn't have, in my view, the advantage of a university
                    year which would have been a change. But spending two years in Washington as a
                    trainee seemed a long time. As a result, though, my Greek was quite good when I
                    went to Greece, because the advantage of the second year was that you were, half
                    time, still a student at FSI. I was very pleased with the training program at
                    FSI.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OWENS: I think I was the only FSO. There were a couple of people from the Agency
                    who were going to either Cyprus or Greece. At that time, it was a very small
                    program. They were training really one FSO a year. I replaced someone in
                    Thessaloniki who had moved on to Athens. The job was called Deputy Principal
                    Officer and Political Officer. It was a fairly large Consulate General.
                    Actually, it wasn't fairly large, it was five officers. Compared to Maracaibo,
                    it seemed large.</p>

                        from '60 to '62. What was the situation there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Well, at that time, it was the conservative government of Constantine
                    Caramanlis that was in power. I would say it was a relatively, from a political
                    point of view, for the first year or so, was a rather tranquil time. Greece was
                    moving ahead economically. One could see the beginnings of prosperity compared
                    to what I had understood to be the situation in Greece in the '50s and late part
                    of the '40s. However, in October of 1961, there were elections which again were
                    won by the conservative party, the ERE party. But the opposition which was led
                    by George Papandreou charged that it was won by fraud and violence. That
                    undermined the stability of Greek life, because the opposition refused to accept
                    the validity of the elections, and they boycotted the...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the official American impression of the
                        elections?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: I think the official American impression was that there was no more fraud
                    and violence than there had been in most Greek elections, in fact probably less.
                    And even to this day, it's hard to say to what degree. I think actually,
                    whatever the validity of the opposition's claim by hammering away at this theme
                    for the next year and a half, they were able to undermine the stability of the
                    government and its credibility. George Papandreou was a very determined man,
                    very eager to become Prime Minister again before time ran out on him. He was in
                    his late sixties at that time. I attended many of the rallies that were held in
                    Thessaloniki and in northern Greece at the time, and there was no evidence then
                    of any coercion. The opposition political leaders were able to move freely and
                    to speak out against the government, and there were enthusiastic crowds. I think
                    the general feeling in the Embassy and shared by us in the Consulate General was
                    that the elections were a fair reflection of the feeling of the Greek public. As
                    it turned out, the Conservatives got, I don't remember the exact figures, close
                    to 50% of the vote and the opposition got 35%, which was an improvement over the
                    1955 elections, and the Communists, the EDA party got 15%. That seemed to us to
                    be a fairly accurate reflection.</p>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>OWENS: I would say it was more conservative. The rural influence was heavier. It
                    was also influenced by the number of Greeks who had fled from Turkey in
                    1922.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Yes, that's right. They were pretty well integrated into Greek society,
                    but it took a long time, and World War II, really, to do that. I would say, in
                    general, it was more conservative than the rest of the country, except in the
                    cities, such as Thessaloniki which did have a liberal opposition mayor. The
                    governor of northern Greece who was appointed by the Athens government reflected
                    the conservative party. It was a very interesting assignment. I was occupied
                    pretty much full time with political work for the first time. I didn't do any
                    consular work there, although the Consul General at the time went on home leave
                    and then was assigned to selection board and was gone six months.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude towards the neighbors? You had
                        Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and of course Turkey there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Yes. Well, at the point that I arrived, the Cyprus crisis was in one of
                    those periodic quiet periods that it would go through for a year or two years.
                    So the thrust was towards the north and the fear of the Slavs, particularly the
                    Bulgars, who were ... And usually the Bulgarians would be mentioned as the
                    greater potential threat as the enemy then. It was felt very strongly by the
                    people in northern Greece, more so than by the people of the south because of
                    the two Balkan wars and the legacy of World War II, when the Bulgarians were
                    allied with the axis powers and had occupied parts of northern Greece. So there
                    were feelings stronger against the Bulgarians than they were towards the Germans
                    by this period in history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feeling there...I say this because in 1992
                        now we're having a flare-up of the so called Macedonian problem which is
                        always around. Was there a feeling about Macedonia? I'm talking about the

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>OWENS: I would say not. The border was very calm. That was 11 years after the end
                    of the civil war in Greece and of course during that period the incursions from
                    Yugoslavia before Marshal Tito closed the border had been quite serious. The
                    communists in 1947 had used that as a sanctuary to move freely between Greece
                    and Yugoslavia. But I believe it was 1948 that Marshal Tito closed the border
                    and as a result the communist guerillas moved into Bulgaria rather than
                    Yugoslavia. So relations with Yugoslavia itself were good. There was this fear
                    as I mentioned of the Bulgarians, but any kind of Yugoslav Macedonian minority
                    was not an issue at the time.</p>

                        trumped up from Athens, to keep the pot boiling rather than a local

                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Perhaps, a little paranoia on the part of the Greek government. Not being
                    there today, it's hard to understand this excitement, and the refusal of the
                    Greek government to accept that a state could have the name of Macedonia since
                    there is a part of Greece called Macedonia. To me, it certainly seems like
                    overreaction, as it does to the members of the European community, and the NATO
                    alliance. How much of it is trumped up, how much of it is, what I would call,
                    the Greek paranoia which can be strong at times, I don't know. I suspect it is a
                    mixture of both. But it was not really an issue at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something was (doubling) away there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: No. It was not. There were complaints from the Turkish minority from time
                    to time that they were discriminated against in Thrace rather than Macedonia, in
                    the area closest to the Turkish border.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you moved to Athens, where you were from '62 to
                        '66?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Right. I replaced Monty Stearns who had been in the political section. I
                    had done a lot of political reporting, as I mentioned, in Thessaloniki, and I
                    got to know the people in Athens. So when that opening came up, they asked me if
                    I would be interested, and I was, so I moved down there. Dan Zachary, whom you
                    know, who had been in the economic section came up to replace me. And so for the
                    next four years I was in Greece doing...</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>OWENS: During a very exciting time. I might mention generally that of course it
                    was a wonderful time to be an American diplomat in Greece. The degree of our
                    influence was great. The prestige of being an American diplomat was great. There
                    was almost no or very little violence of any type in Greek political life, and
                    certainly very little in the social life as well of the people. The occasional
                    shootings by family members over land or over love affairs, but very little
                    crime. Greece itself was prospering, and it was a good time to be there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had two Ambassadors when you were there. First Henry
                        Labouisse from '61 to '65.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Yes. Actually, when I was in Thessaloniki, it was Ellis Briggs who was the
                    Ambassador, whom I knew only slightly. I had gone to the Yugoslav border to meet
                    him when he was coming back to his country of assignment. I visited him a couple
                    of times in Athens, but it was Henry Labouisse and Phillips Talbot during the
                    period that I was in Athens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe their style of operation, that you
                        observed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Yes. Henry Labouisse was of course a high powered executive who was very
                    interesting to work for, very intense person. His wife was the daughter of Marie
                    Curie, a French scientist. She had been very active in the French resistance
                    during World War II. A very impressive, very handsome woman. Henry Labouisse,
                    though, had a style, I think he was from Louisiana originally, somewhat
                    deceptive laid back southern style because he could be very tough and very
                    sharp, and he was. I became eventually his interpreter when he would call on
                    George Papandreou, who during our time there became Prime Minister. It was a
                    good time to be there. One of the advantages, as you know of when you're a
                    younger officer, often in an Embassy, the younger officers in the political
                    session work on the opposition. For instance, I never got to know Caramanlis, I
                    never was included in anything. And of course often the conservatives, the party
                    in power, speak English and so the senior Embassy officers move with ease with
                    them. When the opposition came into power, as it did during my time there,
                    George Papandreou, we, particularly the Greek speakers, were at a premium. But
                    more than that, the fact that we cultivated the opposition, and they were very
                    eager when they were in the opposition to have contacts with the American
                    Embassy, we really came into our own, because we had known them when they were
                    out of power. I think that's true generally for Foreign Service Officers. I
                    would say that's a rule applicable to most.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did George Papandreou come into power?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>OWENS: Well, in the elections of '63, I believe it was either October or November
                    of '63, he won a plurality, but not a majority. Somewhere in my files I have all
                    of this, but he had a slightly greater number of votes in the Parliament. The
                    Parliament was three hundred, and he had a slightly greater number of votes than
                    did the conservative party. However he did not have enough to operate a
                    government unless he accepted the support of the communist party. And he did a
                    very clever thing, he insisted that first he should receive the mandate, since
                    he had the most number of votes, and secondly that, although he should receive
                    the mandate, that he wanted elections within sixty or ninety days because he
                    felt that he didn't have a sufficient majority. So he received the mandate and
                    at the same time his demand for elections was accepted, so he ran the country
                    for let's say a hundred days, and he did a good job. It was generally said that
                    one of the things he did was to approve the purchase of a new plane, airplane,
                    for the royal family, which Caramanlis, for budgetary reasons had refused to
                    approve when he was Prime Minister. Caramanlis, after the King agreed to give
                    the mandate to Papandreou, left the country and went to sulk in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where he stayed until 1970?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: That's right. He came back to lead the conservative party, ERE's election
                    in April of 1964, which Papandreou and his Center Union Party won with a true
                    majority over 50% of the vote.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Embassy impression of Labouisse and the
                        reflections you get of George Papandreou, because he became a very important
                        figure in later events?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: I think there was a skepticism about him. He had, I would say, before,
                    even more than Ambassador Labouisse, the No. 2, Tapley Bennett viewed Papandreou
                    with great skepticism. I do think that the management of the Embassy accepted
                    too literally the evaluations which were coming from the upper levels of the
                    conservative party, the evaluations of the political scene. I think they
                    accepted the concept of Papandreou as being an excellent speaker, a great
                    orator, but of no substance, a blowhard as a number of them referred to him. And
                    it was clear to those of us who were doing the reporting that people at the top
                    in the Embassy, and I don't mean only the Ambassador, were very strongly hoping
                    that the conservatives would be returned, and had difficulty adjusting to the
                    idea that the opposition was going to win, and did win. We even found that our
                    reports which began to give a more favorable impression of the Center Union, or
                    the likelihood that the opposition would win tended to be toned down to make it
                    less likely than we, the drafting officers thought probable.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Greece is an interesting example. I served there as Consul
                        General from '70 to '74. At that time, I felt that there was really a
                        pernicious influence, and that was of the US military, particularly the
                        Greek Americans who were in the US military, and of the CIA, of having a
                        very close to the conservative military side of things. Did you find that
                        this was so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: It was certainly very true of the military, and I guess I developed
                    certain prejudices about the military, and the military attach�s, and the
                    military aid programs from those years, because I saw the ease with which, I
                    felt, they were taken over, our military people, were taken over by the military
                    brass in Greece. The CIA, it was a more complex situation, because, as you
                    mentioned, they were mostly Greek Americans, some of them were conservative,
                    which is more of an agency bias, you might say, but some of them were not. I did
                    feel that it was unhealthy the degree to which the CIA officers were involved in
                    the Greek scene. We used to joke among ourselves, in the political section, that
                    the only difference between us was that we didn't pay for our information. We
                    did have representational allowance and we could take Greek politicians to
                    lunch, and our standing at the time in Greek society was such that it was
                    prestigious to be invited by an American Embassy officer to lunch and to be
                    seen. So we did have some resources. But I used to feel uncomfortable about the
                    fact that my job was, when I went to the Embassy in Athens, to cover domestic
                    political affairs. A colleague of mine, John Day at the time, handled the
                    foreign affairs, Cyprus, relations with Turkey. So I tried to delve as deeply as
                    possible into Greek domestic politics. But I was about to say that going to
                    parliament watching the session at night, which I did most evenings, because
                    usually they would start about six, right after the Embassy closed, and I would
                    go down there and spend a couple of hours, particularly at the more interesting
                    times, as they did become during the time I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seemed to be in later days, when the Embassies were
                        known as aid Embassies, and other ones were known as oil agents, Embassies,
                        this one was known as a CIA Embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: I could see that. Now, I do think that the State Department made a very
                    wise decision to develop a number of Greek speakers that it did. That happened
                    after my time. We were still in a vast minority. Also, I would say at that time,
                    that it was not something the most ambitious officers would have sought, to
                    study Greek, and go to Greece. Later on, I think, it did become much more the
                    case. But, again I think, I could say that I am an ethnic American myself, I
                    don't believe it is a very wise policy, perhaps it is a reactionary viewpoint,
                    to go back to your country of origin to work...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It doesn't work too well, there's a dynamic going on there
                        that's not good. We've done this with Ambassadors, we continue to do this
                        for domestic reasons and personal feelings.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: It seems so natural to Americans. “Oh, you were born in Italy. Well, you
                    should go as an Ambassador to Italy.” It seems so natural.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's considered sort of an insult to the other country.
                        Here's somebody who's left, and then chooses to come back, and there's a
                        tendency to feel they are lording it over the natives. It doesn't work too
                        well. But also there is a tendency to get absorbed by the more conservative,
                        the wealthier people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: That's right. And there's a conflict of loyalties there. If you've been
                    raised, let's say, you're Greek, and you're going to Greek Sunday school, and
                    been inculcated with Greek culture, and so you have deep feelings toward your
                    country. Whereas those of us who were not of that nationality were able to view
                    it a little more dispassionately, and to love Greece, but at the same time
                    realize that we were there as representatives of the American government, and
                    our primary, only loyalty, really, was to the United States government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the role of the Greek
                        press?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Very irresponsible. In those days, I used to think of the American press,
                    and to some extent the British press, as being models. I'm not so sure today,
                    but certainly in comparison with the Greek press, with its sensationalism, the
                    lack of reliance on fact, and appealing to some of the worst emotions. And that
                    was one of the criticisms of George Papandreou, that he, and as it was to be
                    even more so I think, of his son, Andreas Papandreou, that it played on the
                    worst emotions of the Greeks. Their nationalistic passions, rather than the more
                    long term constructive values. And I think George Papandreou was not above
                    playing that card from time to time himself, and under the influenced of his
                    son. But that gets us into a whole different period of Greek history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about when Papandreou was there. Did you
                        feel that there was more of a division in Greek political life, was this
                        causing more of a polarization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Yes, I would have to say so. I should mention, I've written a chapter for
                    a book on modern Greece, I think it was called: “PASOK in Power.”</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>OWENS: That was the party of Andreas Papandreou. But I did a psychological study
                    of Andreas Papandreou for that book. The reason I mention that is one of my main
                    themes was the entrance of Andreas Papandreou in the spring of 1964 in Greek
                    political life, upped the stakes and intensified the polarization, which had
                    always existed to some degree in Greek political life, in fact which had existed
                    very strongly back in the '30s and '40s and earlier periods, but which had been
                    somewhat dormant during the '50s and '60s. I think Andreas upped the stakes and
                    made it either us or them. It turned it into a zero sum game, so that
                    eventually, I think that by working that issue, he convinced the power structure
                    that it was not possible for Greece to endure an eventual Andreas Papandreou
                    government. George Papandreou always was felt as, well, many consider him
                    superficial, but nevertheless there was a feeling that he was a man of ultimate
                    moderation, that he was a politician of the old stripe, wanted to stay in power,
                    and therefore he was not going to do extremely irresponsible things to upset the
                    applecart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, here was Andreas Papandreou who'd been an American
                        citizen, taught in American schools, etc...served in the American navy.
                        We're trying to go back to the time. You were there when he turned into a
                        Greek again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Yes. Exactly. I knew him well. He lived down the street. I lived on Odos
                    Gizy out in Palio Psychiko, and he lived also on that street. Our children
                    played together. I met him through Monty Stearns when I was still in
                    Thessaloniki because Constantine Caramanlis, the leader of the conservative
                    party, had brought him back in 1959, I believe, to head an economic research
                    center, if I remember well. I think it was to Caramanlis's credit that he
                    recognized the need for a scientific approach to improving the Greek economy,
                    that he brought back the son of the opposition leader, George Papandreou. He
                    brought back Andreas Papandreou. Of course, as you mentioned, Andreas, at that
                    time, had a Ph.D. from Harvard, had served in the US Navy, had become a US
                    citizen, taught at Northwestern University, and later became chairman of the
                    Economics Department at Berkeley. No one knew that he might harbor any political
                    ambitions, and I got to know him quite well when I took up the contact that
                    Monty had had when I came down in '62. We became, I thought, rather good
                    friends. He was an utterly charming man who seemingly understood the American
                    political scene, and also had a scepticism about Greek politics, and indicated
                    that he would not get into it. However, when the situation changed, he didn't
                    enter into the 1963 elections. He was smart enough, although his father had
                    tried to persuade him to join the party, he declined to keep his position.
                    However, after George Papandreou won a plurality, he decided to throw his hat in
                    the ring in 1964. Of course, it was a sure thing because he ran in his father's
                    old constituency of Patras and was elected overwhelmingly to the seat. So he
                    became a member of Parliament, was immediately appointed to a senior position in
                    his father's cabinet. I would say that's when the situation changed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OWENS: In looking back, I think some of us, certainly I began to examine more
                    closely his behavior in the United States, and one noticed that in 1948, rather
                    than supporting Harry S. Truman, he supported Henry Wallace, which suggested a
                    not just liberal politician.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Henry Wallace was the...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Henry Wallace was the so-called progressive party who was identified,
                    although not a communist himself, was considered...Papandreou had supported
                    Henry Wallace, a leader of the then progressive party, who was against the
                    Marshall Plan, aid to Greece and Turkey. Although later Andreas returned to the
                    more traditional democratic fold and supported Adlai Stevenson in '52 and '56
                    against Dwight Eisenhower, and took an active part in those campaigns. But I
                    think that Andreas's wife, Margaret, in her book which I believe is titled
                    “Democracy at Gun Point,” describes the fact that Andreas did have a dual
                    personality. On one side, he was a dispassionate American scholar, and on the
                    other hand he became a very emotional Greek, completely subjective, and a
                    believer in the Greek reality. So, there was this war within him, and Andreas,
                    as I mentioned, I'd been personally reasonably close to him, as had a number of
                    other members of the Embassy staff, and shortly after he became a member of his
                    father's government, he began to distance himself from us, so that by the summer
                    of '64, he took an extreme position towards the then head of USIA, a gentleman
                    by the name of Vincent Joyce, and claimed that Vince Joyce, when he had called
                    on him in connection with the American broadcasting in Greece, had pounded on
                    his table and said: “You will do certain things.” All of which, we on the
                    Embassy staff, thought to be very dubious. Joyce was in the United States at the
                    time when these charges came out, but although the government of George
                    Papandreou never did declare Vince Joyce persona non grata, they did indicate to
                    us that...the Foreign Minister of the time told us that Vincent Joyce would not
                    be welcome back in Greece. He also had a Turkish wife, and the Cyprus question
                    had erupted again. To make a long story short, he left Greece shortly
                    thereafter, assigned to another post. This was Andreas's first ... He had been
                    accused in the Greek press of being too pro-American. That was the accusations
                    of his enemies, and I mean his enemies not just on the right, but his enemies
                    within his father's party, the Center Union, as it was called at the time.</p>

                <p>OWENS: Yes, beginning in 1964, that's correct. And not only the United States,
                    but the power forces of Greece, by that I mean the army, the throne, the crown.
                    Greek businessmen began to note that Andreas, more than others, tended to go for
                    broke.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OWENS: That's right. He showed a certain stridency, inflexibility, rigidity, and
                    soon divided his father's own party, and we soon learned there was a split which
                    they tried to paper over between father and son. It's one of the modern traumas
                    of Greek life, the split between George and Andreas Papandreou. Because the
                    father felt that Andreas was beginning to undermine his government, and so by
                    the time an actual split in the party did come in the summer of 1965, a large
                    group of the party bolted from George Papandreou.</p>

                        with the opposition. George Papandreou who was trying to run backwards to
                        keep away from the Americans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: When you say “deal with the opposition”, this was actually the
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not the opposition, but the split in the ruling
                        party.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Well, the Greek were quite willing to talk with us. I knew, for example,
                    George Papandreou's private secretary, a man, and we became very good friends.
                    He disliked Andreas. And then, other members of the government disliked Andreas,
                    so it was easy to get the anti-Andreas line, from within the party, of course.
                    Then there was the opposition, the former conservative party, but they were
                    outside the loop, you might say. Then, we were easily able to get the Andreas
                    Papandreou line, not from him personally. He tended to avoid identification with
                    the Americans. As I say, I think this is one of the factors that triggered this,
                    the accusation that he was too closely identified, that he was more an American
                    than a Greek. We felt, initially, that this was just an effort on his part to
                    disprove that, but it turned out to be much deeper than that.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>OWENS: Well, the communist party was considered an agent of Moscow, and there was
                    always the extreme right wing fear that there was a link between Andreas and the
                    communists, which was very nebulous. I mentioned earlier that we began to look
                    at Andreas's background, earlier back, when we were trying to understand the
                    reason for his behavior. He had been, as a young law student in Athens before
                    World War II, very active in the campaign against the then dictator Metaxas, at
                    one time, was arrested by the agents of the dictatorship, and reportedly
                    tortured, and informed on a number of his colleagues. It was shortly after that
                    that his father, because of the impending crisis in Europe and then the German
                    invasion, wanted to send him to the United States to continue his education, as
                    many other prominent Greeks did. They sent their children to the United States,
                    particularly their sons for education to keep them out of the war. Andreas was
                    the most prominent among the group that did return to Greece in the '50s and
                    early '60s who had established, became professors, for instance in American
                    universities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about the communists? Did we have any dealings
                        with them at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: We did not. Our policy was to, had been the policy all the time that I had
                    been in Greece and remained that way for a long time, not to have any dealings
                    with the communist party, not to treat them as a legitimate opposition party,
                    and so they were never invited, we were discouraged from having any social
                    contact with them. The only things we would get would be the CIA reports of
                    third party, you would say, that various communist figures said this or that. So
                    that was our knowledge, really of the communist party, that, plus reading the
                    AVGI, which was the communist mouthpiece. But in a sense, that was pretty much
                    left to the agency to follow. We dealt with what was considered the legitimate
                    political parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There might be an official feeling, but within the
                        Embassy, within let's say the political section, what was the feeling? Where
                        were the Greek communists. Some of the communist parties are very much a
                        tool of the Soviets and other ones have a real root within their own
                        country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Yes. You have to remember, in the '60s, most of the communist parties of
                    Europe were still under the control of Moscow. The Euro-communist was something
                    that, at least in my experience, didn't really appear until the late '60s or
                    early '70s.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OWENS: That's right. And I think that was the feeling about the Greek communists.
                    Obviously there were factions within the party, and there were tensions with
                    Moscow, but since we weren't able to follow them, really weren't very aware of
                    those.</p>

                        they grab people in, and you become partisan one way or the other. Could you
                        talk a bit about some of the personalities within this and how they played,
                        because you were in an interesting position?</hi>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>OWENS: Alright. You mentioned the attitude of the leadership, the Embassy
                    management I should say towards the political scene. I think we, at the working
                    level, if I may use that term, the middle level reporting officers, felt that
                    our leadership, our Ambassador, the DCM, and even the political Counselor who
                    was H. Daniel Brewster at that time, were much more sympathetic towards the then
                    government in power of Caramanlis, and it got to the point that, when we were
                    reporting on the elections and how things were going, we were constantly doing
                    sort of wrapups of, “Well, this week it seems that ...” Greece at that time did
                    not have opinion polls at least not reliable ones. You really had to go out and
                    do your soundings and follow the press, and follow the debates in Parliament,
                    and we would say: “It looks as though Papandreou has momentum.” And so you would
                    do a piece, and reporting that, and it might pass through the political
                    counselor, then it would get to the DCM and he would say...”Well, let's say
                    Papandreou used the 'pie in the sky' approach...” And I remember this has stuck
                    in my mind, “seems to be gaining some adherence.” “Gee, this isn't an expression
                    I would use.” “Well, put that in.” Then he'd go through the despatch or telegram
                    and soften the criticism of the government and weaken any suggestion that maybe
                    there were legitimate grievances that Papandreou was (exploiting). So, it was
                    clear, and one of the things that always struck me, particularly on the social
                    level, the Ambassador and the DCM were, so to speak, hobnobbing with the wealthy
                    families in the society who, and almost always, not completely, but usually,
                    were conservative and supported the Caramanlis government, which later became
                    the opposition. Now I say there were some exceptions because some of the liberal
                    families which supported the Center Union party also were quite monied, but they
                    were the exceptions. Generally, the upper income businessmen, executives, top
                    professionals, not all, but generally, also supported the conservatives. These
                    were people who spoke English fluently, who did have the resources to entertain
                    in their homes. Most, and this was interesting, most of the Center Union people
                    tended to be much more likely to have come from humbler origin, either blue
                    collar or rural, and who felt more comfortable with us on the lower level of the
                    Embassy hierarchy as well, since we were not living in the grand houses that
                    Embassy management was living in. But, the Ambassador, I think, felt quite, he
                    became quite...</p>

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>OWENS: Labouisse. I'm talking now about the period '63 to '65. Henry Labouisse
                    became quite friendly with Caramanlis. He did become quite friendly with one
                    opposition leader who was not really of the left, and this was Spiros
                    Markezinis, who led the small Progressive Party. And I remember now that we
                    would all get together on election night, and follow the returns, usually at one
                    of our houses, and the Ambassador would come, the Chief of Station would come,
                    the DCM. I remember that Markezinis, when it became clear that night, not only
                    did his party suffer badly that night, but he himself was not going to be
                    reelected, that a wife of one of the officials present made a disparaging remark
                    about Markezinis and the Ambassador stormed out furious. He was just angry that
                    anyone would criticize his good friend. So, I think that there became a sense of
                    personal involvement, which was as important as any ideological involvement.
                    These were their friends, and they did not like to see them defeated.</p>

                        Papandreou came into power? What was your feeling about the desk? You were
                        in the Near-Eastern bureau at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: We were in the Near Eastern bureau, and it was sort of the stepchild of
                    the Near Eastern bureau. There was very little interest in Greece. Greece had
                    had a certain sex appeal simply because it had been in the front lines of the
                    struggles against communism back in the '40s. That was no longer the case. The
                    US was gradually withdrawing its heavy AID package to Greece. We were still
                    continuing military assistance, but it was felt that Greece had reached the
                    take-off point, and like Taiwan, I guess Singapore at the time, it was felt that
                    these were emerging countries that had passed the development stage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The take-off point was very much an In thing with Walter
                        Rostow, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: That's right. Those were the buzz words of the early 1960s, and so that we
                    no longer needed the paternal, the kind of direct economic grant aid that had
                    characterized earlier periods. Greece was not in the forefront of Washington
                    policy thinkers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, really, the dynamics were coming, on policy, what
                        there was, was really from the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Yes, you see, the desk pretty much monitored it, and the desk officers
                    were usually middle level to lower senior level people, so you had much more...
                    The dynamic was right at the Embassy itself, and so the Embassy pretty much set
                    the policy. It was a case also where the State Department was together with the
                    Agency, was running things, because you didn't have a great deal of White House
                    interest, at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, I take it that Greece was not looked upon as an
                        absolutely critical ally in a military sense, except for the fact that we
                        had some bases that we wanted to keep.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: The bases were important, and it was important for the cohesiveness of the
                    NATO alliance. But obviously Turkey always loomed a little larger in our
                    calculation because of its much larger population and hence more significant
                    defense capability. So, I think it was three times larger than that of Greece,
                    as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know you've been doing some studies about how the
                        Foreign Service should operate right now in 1992. But you, the dynamic,
                        you're reporting about the more senior officers being sort of co-opted more
                        into the conservative society because they speak English, and the junior
                        officers were more likely to be language officers, being, you might say,
                        more skeptical of conservative forces. This is not at all unique within
                        Embassies, this is one that often goes on, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Oh yes, I think that's the case. I suspect that it pervades other aspects
                    of American life. Probably your newspaper publisher is going to be more likely
                    to be a golf playing friend of the big corporate executives, whereas the more
                    junior journalist is going to be dealing with the radical... So it's quite a
                    natural division of labor. In a sense, we were left the crumbs from the table,
                    and they were generally the opposition. If we reported on the government in
                    power during the pre-Center Union days, it was usually sort of a second hand
                    from what the political counselor, or the Deputy Chief of Mission would come
                    back from a dinner, and tell us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a practical measure, from what you're saying,
                        Washington really did not have a firm policy. This later became very much a
                        point in a conspiracy theory of what we did later on. It sounds as though
                        we're reporting, yes, but we're reporting almost to a vacuum back in
                        Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Relatively little interest back in Washington. Greece had to be monitored
                    because it was considered a volatile society, and since it was a member of NATO,
                    something you had to keep your eye on, but it was not by any means on the front
                    burner. It was not causing major problems until 1965, so that I would say for
                    the first five years of my tour there, Greece was relatively tranquil. The State
                    Department had pretty much its own way, and the Embassy in particular set pretty
                    much the policy, essentially not to rock the boat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also the Greek-American community was not as mobilized as
                        it became really after 1970 on, in the United States, and its great power in
                        Congress. You didn't feel it as much, did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>OWENS: Absolutely. We met the AHEPA officials when they came out, but they were
                    not a major focus of the Embassy. In other words, the Ambassador knew that he
                    had to entertain them when the AHEPA, the American Hellenic Society in the
                    United States came. Their leaders were of course given proper respect, but they
                    were not a major force because they were not making themselves felt politically
                    in the United States, to the extent they did later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were no particular issue to galvanize them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Many Greeks continue to be split on the Greek political scene, although
                    the Greek-American has been more partial, in general, towards the conservative
                    government, and less partial towards the Papandreou, father and son.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do we talk now of the after '65 development, the
                        development after the split? What was the George Papandreou party
                        called?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: It was called the Enosis Kentro, which in English translates Center Union.
                    The two parties were the ERE party of then Panayiotis Kanellopoulos, the
                    successor to Caramanlis, because Caramanlis had sulked in Paris, and George
                    Papandreou led Enosis Kentro. We want to talk also about the royal family and
                    their role in this.</p>
                <p>Today is Bastille day, July 14, 1992. This is the second interview with John
                    Owens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As we mentioned at the end of the last tape, there are two
                        things that we ought to talk about. One is the political events of 1965 and
                        the other is the role of the monarchy. Which would you like to tackle
                        first?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: I think you can intertwine them, because it was in '65 that the government
                    of George Papandreou was forced out of office. Essentially it was the King who
                    forced him out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have been ... Which king was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Constantine. Constantine, was still very much influenced by his mother,
                    Frederika who was the widow of the late King Paul who had died in 1964.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political section's analysis when the King
                        died and the ascent of the new king Constantine who was still relatively
                        young.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>OWENS: I think it had been felt that he had been somewhat of a playboy, and he
                    had never buckled down to serious issues, had not finished the university, was
                    most known for his touring around town in a convertible and always with
                    attractive women. However, he settled down after he ascended the throne. I think
                    he was very devoted to his father and was deeply shocked by his death. As often
                    happens in the Embassies, the royal family, while not off limits to those of us
                    in the political section, was pretty much the province of the Ambassador and
                    DCM, certainly not lower than DCM, and perhaps the Chief of Station. But whereas
                    we felt very comfortable with the political figures of the day with whom we had
                    excellent contacts, our knowledge of the royal family was filtered through what
                    we got from the top and what our political contacts told us about the royal
                    family. It was clear that the royal family was displeased with George
                    Papandreou, not so much with George as by the antics of his son, Andreas.</p>
                <p>The King was informed by the Minister of Defense, Garoufalias was his name, that
                    there seemed to be a secret organization called “Aspida” within the Greek
                    military, and that it seemed to be loyal only to Andreas Papandreou. That it was
                    a radical, or at least seemingly socialistic type of organization, made up
                    apparently of only a few officers. Nevertheless, it was very disturbing to the
                    royal family which considered itself to have a special relationship with the
                    armed forces, and any tampering with the armed forces would be viewed with great
                    alarm by the monarchy. So, in the summer of 1965, the King called for several
                    private meetings between the King and George Papandreou. Papandreou in the
                    summer of 1965 announced that he was resigning. Then the King attempted to
                    establish a new government. Of course the Center Union had a majority in the
                    Parliament, so there was no way he could get members of the conservative ERE
                    party to form a government, since it wouldn't have enough seats, even if it
                    combined with the communist party, which it would not do in any case.</p>
                <p>So what happened was that efforts were made to obtain defectors from the Center
                    Union. It was known that there was a large group within the Center Union which
                    was dissatisfied with the policies of George Papandreou. Again, not so much with
                    George Papandreou as with Andreas, and this was particularly the Minister of
                    Finance, Constantinos Mitsotakis, who considered himself the heir apparent to
                    George Papandreou, and who had been groomed as the next successor, the next
                    Prime Minister, until Andreas entered the picture with his entry into Greek
                    politics, in 1964. So that made Mitsotakis uncertain about his own future. He
                    and Andreas, during '64 and '65 indulged in a rather public feud as to the
                    future leadership of the party.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>In any event, three efforts were made to form a government during the summer of
                    1965, first by Athanassiadis Novas, who had been speaker of the government and
                    also a member of George Papandreou's party. Then another effort, later in the
                    summer by Elias Tsirimokos, who had been a minister also and in Papandreou's
                    party, and then finally by Stephen Stephanopoulos who was the Vice Premier, the
                    Deputy Prime Minister, and he succeeded in forming a government based... There
                    were some thirty-odd defectors, as they were called from the Center Union party,
                    who formed a government with the support of the conservative ERE party which
                    gave them a bare majority. I think there were 300 seats in the Parliament in
                    those days, and the ERE party had approximately 120. So they were able to get a
                    bare majority of 151, I think. 151 or 152. But the conservative government
                    deputies did not actively participate in the government. So you had a government
                    composed of the thirty-odd defectors of the Center Union and such people as
                    Stephanopoulos, Mitsotakis, Tsirimokos, etc. Of course, Mitsotakis is today the
                    Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>It was said at the time that these people who had defected would never be
                    accepted again by any party, that they would be permanently branded with the
                    label of traitor because they had left Papandreou. But they were able to cloak
                    under the guise, legitimate or not, of national salvation, that the country was
                    in a terrible state. Although many of the people who participated in that
                    government are deceased by now, are retired from politics, Mitsotakis is still
                    very much in the picture. During that period of '65, it was a very exciting
                    period for those of us in the Embassy, certainly for me covering the Greek
                    domestic political scene, because Papandreou was determined that the new
                    government would not succeed, so each time that they would have a vote of
                    confidence on these three successive tries over those months...in fact I can't
                    recall what month it was finally voted in, I think it was late September. Each
                    time Papandreou would have his followers outside the Parliament building in
                    downtown Athens, chanting for Papandreou, denouncing the defectors as traitors,
                    putting a lot of pressure on them. There were a number of violent street
                    demonstrations during that time. The political tempers really heated up. I
                    remember going to one rally which got out of hand and the police fired tear gas
                    and I got a whiff of it, which I didn't like very much. So it was an interesting
                    period, we would go back to the Embassy at night, and type up the cables, even
                    if no one was paying much attention in Washington, it was very exciting for
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there a feeling in the Embassy that this might move
                        into civil insurrection?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>OWENS: Yes, I think even dictatorship. We knew that the military was uneasy about
                    the course of events. They felt that you were really in unchartered waters now.
                    The king had forced a government out, and created a government that was not
                    really a popularly elected government, even though these people had all on their
                    own been elected, but under the Papandreou banner. Andreas Papandreou, of
                    course, who was never reluctant to indulge in extreme rhetoric went even further
                    and talked about the sinister forces, in which he would include the United
                    States, the crown, the army, and far beyond what his own father wanted. In fact
                    I remember that after the coup, Andreas Papandreou tells in his own book, that
                    when he first saw his father, after they had both been arrested by the Junta, a
                    couple of days after the coup d'etat, that the father accused him, “You brought
                    this on us by your antics, by your extreme ways.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had we gotten any information/warning from the military,
                        or the CIA, as it came to you about Andreas and his dealings with
                        Aspida?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Actually, very little. Well Aspida was investigated even during the time
                    of the Stephanopoulos government which ruled throughout the rest of '65, and
                    then throughout '66, but nothing conclusive ever came out of it. Even the Junta
                    was unable to really prove these charges. There was something, and this is only
                    a surmise on my part, that it was a loose association of like-minded, shall we
                    say, progressive officers who looked to Andreas Papandreou for a new Greece,
                    more modern type of government. So, it seemed to have been much to do about
                    nothing. But beyond the specifics of Aspida, the king and the conservative
                    establishment generally were disturbed by Andreas. George Papandreou after all
                    was from old cut of typical politicians. Many conservative Greeks thought he was
                    all talk and no action, a blowhard. He was an excellent orator and a very
                    charming person, but certainly one who was not going to endanger the republic,
                    the Kingdom I should say. Andreas Papandreou, though, with his American ways and
                    his militancy which he had developed during the course of being in the civil
                    rights movement and also he supported even within the American political
                    spectrum, was far to the left, he supported Henry Wallace rather than Harry
                    Truman in '48, which suggested that he was quite far to the left.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at the King again, realizing that this was not
                        your contact, but in your reporting, what were you getting from the
                        Ambassador and the DCM, as far as the King and his relations with his
                        mother, on the political side?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>OWENS: Well, I think two things. Certainly that the mother was very influential,
                    that she paid a great deal of attention to Greek politics, probably too much,
                    and that the King was somewhat unsure of himself, but had become convinced that
                    the Papandreou were a threat, if not directly to the monarchy, certainly to the
                    Greek conservative traditional establishment, let us say. Andreas, if he were to
                    come to power, because his popularity increased dramatically after this, and
                    there was a feeling that if elections were held that Andreas might...although it
                    would still be led by his father, that the father might step down or in any case
                    might die since he was I think at the time '77 or '78 when he was forced out.
                    There was a general feeling that they could live with George Papandreou and with
                    the rather traditionalist, if slightly more liberal members of the Center Union
                    who were in the George Papandreou government. They could not live with an
                    Andreas Papandreou type of government. I think this is the most important fact,
                    that Andreas represented forces and ideas, possibilities, which the powers that
                    be generally felt that they could not live with. But the monarchy itself...from
                    the Ambassador, first it was Henry Labouisse, then later Phillips Talbots, were
                    getting indications from their meetings with the royal family...and also we did
                    have contacts further down the scale. Norb Anschutz, the deputy chief of
                    mission, used to meet with Major Arnaoutis who was the Chef de Cabinet of the
                    King, then a young army officer, who was a good contact, and Norb probably
                    talked to you about that. So, then I think that Norb had a good feel for...</p>

                <p>OWENS: That's right. Anschutz was completely open and displayed no biases, we

                    where they may.</p>

                <p>OWENS: Definitely. He was a very popular DCM, and I certainly admired him. I felt
                    that he had an excellent sense of judgment, and wanted us simply to get the
                    facts, unpleasant and unpalatable as they might be.</p>

                <p>OWENS: I was there four years, and I'd been two years earlier in Thessaloniki. So

                </p>
                <p>OWENS: I thought they looked very ominous. I did do a paper and I think it was
                    for Elizabeth Bracken. You mentioned Elizabeth Brown, so they've had two women
                    Political Counselors in Athens. I had forgotten that. Anyway, Elizabeth Bracken
                    succeeded Alfred Vigderman who had succeeded Dan Brewster as Political
                    Counselor. I did a paper saying that my contacts...I had got to know a General
                    Saicellariou who was Chief of Staff of the Army. I'd known him over the years
                    because he had been in Thessaloniki while I was there, and he had been Deputy
                    Commander of the 3rd Army. He was speaking rather ominously that he was
                    concerned over the way things were going. My own feeling, and I think it was
                    shared by many in the Embassy, was that there was a danger of a coup, but that
                    it would come from the Generals. This was a belief I had...</p>

                    proceeded, I might say, to the desk, and I was on the desk at the time of the
                    coup.</p>

                </p>

                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>OWENS: Very unstable. We were worried about what was going to happen. And indeed,
                    the Stephanopoulos government finally fell. I believe it was in December '66, at
                    which time it was replaced by a minority government headed by Panayiotis
                    Kanellopoulos who had been the Deputy to Caramanlis and who had led the ERE
                    party while Caramanlis sat in Paris. Caramanlis was still in self-imposed exile.
                    And the King promised to take the country to elections, which as you know were
                    scheduled within a month from the time the coup occurred.</p>

                    that was April. 6 or 7 hours ahead. We got the word at about 8:30, 9 o'clock at
                    night. I remember rushing back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to that...You had this peculiar thing of
                        Greece being plunked down to the Near-East within the Washington
                        bureaucracy. It was part of the Near-Eastern Bureau at that time and we've
                        alluded to this before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: We were outside the mainstream.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OWENS: That's correct. I would say that earlier when I came to the desk, it was
                    then the Greek Country Directorate. However, the year before and for the
                    previous many years, it had been an office called the Greece, Turkey, and Iran,
                    the GTI, which also included Cyprus. We tended to be grouped then by a DAS who
                    was in charge...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Deputy Assistant Secretary of State?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>OWENS: Deputy Assistant Secretary of State who was Stuart Rockwell, who had
                    served in Iran, and I think also as Ambassador to Morocco. He knew the Islamic
                    world quite well. He was less familiar with Greece, but was nevertheless a very
                    astute individual. We were not in the mainstream.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were talking, I assume when you were reporting on
                        this, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but you had interesting
                        stories to tell, but there was no essential rapport there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: That's right, and at the big staff meetings, the attention given Greece
                    was minimal. Director H. Daniel Brewster generally attended, but sometimes it
                    fell to me. I handled the political side. Milnar Dunn handled the economic side.
                    When I went there, I noticed people would listen patiently and then ask few
                    questions. The word was from Dunn to be brief, because they weren't terribly
                    interested. Now, once, later, when the coup did occur, then interest suddenly
                    peaked. It was quite intense. So you're absolutely correct. We were out of the
                    mainstream and not of great interest to the Near-Eastern Bureau which was headed
                    by Luke Battle, Lucius Battle who was the Assistant Secretary of State. They did
                    what was necessary. If a prominent Greek came to town, the Foreign Minister,
                    they would trot out and attend the luncheon that the Greeks would give. We would
                    usually be able to get the Greek Foreign Minister. I remember going to see the
                    Deputy Secretary who was called the Under Secretary, I think. Nicholas
                    Katzenbach, with the then Foreign Minister. But generally there was minimal
                    interest, a very limited interest in Greece in those days.</p>

                        Papandreou, under the auspices of his father George, wins the elections, the
                        PASOK, so what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Well, I thought that Andreas was taking an increasingly anti-American
                    line. I did feel it would be inimical, disadvantageous to American interests if
                    Andreas Papandreou were elected. Yes, I did, looking at it coldly from the point
                    of view of US interests. US bases, Greek participation in NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you think really this would be at issue. In a way,
                        Greece was in NATO with its bases for one reason and one alone really, and
                        that was for Greek interests to balance off Turkey. If Greece opted out, we
                        just moved in greater numbers to Turkey.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>OWENS: Well, I think there were a couple of factors there, through. I agree it
                    was definitely in Greece's interest to be in NATO, and later to be in the EEC.
                    But Andreas, as I considered him a somewhat irresponsible leader, was certainly
                    not beyond doing a disservice to Greek interests as well. I think states often
                    do things that are opposed to their long term interests to satisfy the passions
                    of the moment. But actually, the reason was a little deeper than that. It was
                    the feeling that the Greek democracy was of some fragility and that it would
                    probably not hold together if Andreas came to power, that maybe the right wing
                    might move in a way as we talked earlier of a General's coup, that somehow
                    autocratic forces would come, that you would have instability, and possibly a
                    rightist takeover. So, it was not only the thought that if Andreas came into
                    power, he would take Greece out of NATO. It was clear that the power forces of
                    Greece would not permit that. That before he would succeed, he would probably be
                    overthrown. So we saw that this was leading probably to chaos. So we hoped, if
                    not a conservative moderate victory, at least a stalemate, so that Andreas would
                    not be in power and checked. But I certainly felt that we should not support any
                    extra-legal activities.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Yes, that was clear. I felt that all during the time I was there. We used
                    to joke, and I'm sure it was said at other U.S. missions, that they paid for
                    what we were getting free. But somehow, the fact that it would come in as from a
                    confidential source, and you as political officer might get it directly, say
                    from the Prime Minister's secretary or from a leading member of a party, didn't
                    seem to have quite the same mystical appeal that the agency reports would from
                    undisclosed sources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's pernicious. I had the same thing when I was in Athens

                <p>OWENS: Well, I did a paper about fifteen years ago on the coup and on the
                    perspective of what happened in Washington. I sent it to the Department about
                    five years ago for clearance and it recently came back. Most of the juicy parts,
                    including the exchange of cables with the Embassy during the first days, and so
                    on, were all deleted. Much of this as you know is still classified.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Well, I would say that the impact was one of shock. I remember being
                    called down to the Op Center. Dan Brewster and I were both called down. I think
                    Stuart Rockwell came in. Later on Luke Battle came wearing a black tie. He had
                    been at a dinner party. So, we had gotten a curt message from the Ambassador
                    saying that he had been unable to get to the Embassy and that there were troops
                    in the street, etc. Later on during the night it was confirmed that there had
                    been a coup. He had been able to talk with several people, several political
                    leaders, and he learned that Kanellopoulos, the conservative prime minister had
                    been arrested. That the colonels had gone out to see the King who had first told
                    them to get lost, but eventually agreed to talk to them. It was a sleepless
                    night in Athens, and also for us back in Washington. Then the question became
                    one of what we should do, some of us advocating a tougher line, not giving any
                    recognition to the junta, others saying the old justification of a dictatorship
                    that at least we won't have Andreas, and things will get done efficiently. We
                    decided on a cool, but correct policy. We drafted the message which was
                    subsequently issued by the Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we go back. “We decided on a cool, but correct
                        policy.” How was a policy decision like this...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Well, it was hammered out. First we would meet, let us say, with Stuart
                    Rockwell who was the Deputy Assistant Secretary in charge of our area. That is
                    Dan Brewster, Milnar Dunn and myself, then we would be joined by the INR people,
                    and then later we would go to further meetings with agency personnel. Then it
                    would sort of leave that level and Rockwell would go up and discuss it with
                    Battle, and it would go up to the Secretary. I think that State had initially
                    the lead on this. Whatever State wanted to do at that time, in the early first
                    couple of days probably would have prevailed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was coming in from the Embassy? What role were they
                        playing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>OWENS: Well, a tough role. Now, the King did seek our support, and there was some
                    thought we could maybe even make a landing, bring in the marines to overthrow
                    the junta. This was not formally proposed, but it would have been rejected out
                    of hand. We had after all, the Dominican Republic fiasco, and it was the sense
                    that we didn't want to go down that road again. But it certainly showed that the
                    King initially, in fact throughout this time, disliked the junta, did not
                    support it, and as you know, tried eventually to mount a counter-coup in
                    December which failed, and he was forced to flee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that there might be a right wing
                        coup by the generals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Yes, that had been feared. The King and our Ambassador had gone in before
                    the coup, saying that he was hearing these rumblings. We wanted to make it clear
                    that we would not support any kind of forcible overthrow of a democratic
                    government. We weren't thinking that they would overthrow Kanellopoulos, the
                    fear was that maybe just at the time of elections, or as soon as they saw the
                    results, the right wing effort might be undertaken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think our reaction might have been different, had
                        this been generals rather than these sort of unknown colonels?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: You mean less strong?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Less strong, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: No, because I don't think it was that strong, from my own point of view.
                    You know, our “cool, but correct” policy gradually mellowed. Once things were
                    set in place, and it was clear that the junta was in power, then the pressures
                    began to come from the military, and because we halted some shipments of
                    military assistance which was going to go. And of course, the military were
                    saying...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about our military?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>OWENS: Our military. US military shipments to the Greek government. The
                    Department of Defense immediately took the line: “We're only hurting our friends
                    if we do this, (take a tough line towards the junta) Greece will be weakened in
                    NATO, who knows maybe Moscow might make points in Greece if we took a tough
                    line...” The agency took that line too. Unfortunately, our leadership, I felt,
                    was not strong in maintaining a demand for a tougher line. So, as often happens,
                    State gradually caved. We agreed within a few weeks not to intercede with Litton
                    Industries which was negotiating a major project, an agreement to construct a
                    major project in the Peloponnese, Patras, I think. This was a coup for the
                    Papadopoulos government because it showed that it was gaining respectability.
                    And so gradually, the tough line eroded.</p>
                <p>Now I left the desk by the fall. I was pretty disgusted. I felt that in any
                    event, I'd spent seven years on Greece, either in Greece or... Well, really
                    eight years, since I had spent a year studying the language. So I had involved
                    eight years of my career in Greece and it was time to move on. But I was
                    dissatisfied with... I felt, in those very early days, that we, even at the
                    country directorate level, because of our knowledge, we were dealing with a
                    situation where we knew Greece and most of our superiors did not. They were very
                    dependent upon us. People acquired superficial expertise then very quickly in
                    the months that followed. Suddenly there were a lot of instant Greek experts as
                    interest in Greece intensified in the Congress as Papandreou supporters in the
                    general American academic community, and to some extent in the Greek American
                    community which began to get fired up and put pressure on Congress to do
                    something, first of all about Andreas Papandreou, but also about the junta.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to play the media off, at least as much as
                        you could. This was very unpopular both in Congress and in the media. No
                        matter what it is in the academic world, Greece and democracy go together,
                        it is a Greek word? So this one hit close to home. Also within Europe too,
                        you might say that the whole intellectual academic community and the
                        media...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>OWENS: Well, I thought it was a great opportunity lost. We would be on the side
                    of the angels. The tough guys always seem to prevail in this kind of a
                    situation. I went to a number of meetings... (end of side 1 of tape 2)You didn't
                    have to be particularly perceptive to realize that eventually the chickens would
                    come home to roost and we would pay a price for this and that we would be blamed
                    in Greece and I was thinking also, historically, blamed by the world if we
                    supported the junta and therefore we should take a very tough line. They (the
                    apologists for the junta) would answer, “well, the military and the agency have
                    teamed up on this” and they would say: “well, all well and good” the implication
                    was that an anti-junta line was rather Pollyanna-ish, that you're dealing in
                    impractical idealistic terms, the point that Greece is a NATO ally, we need it,
                    the Greeks have done it to themselves, it's not up to us to determine the
                    justness of it, and it is in effect the government that's in power, and
                    therefore we should go along with, work with it and we can influence them,
                    supposedly, by working with them, that line... To me it was so clear that we
                    would pay a price and that we had a chance. I feel that a great moment of
                    opportunity was there, had we had strong leadership in the Department, I think
                    it could have prevailed, because I think the top leadership, I mean the
                    government leadership, the US government could have been persuaded to take a
                    tougher line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking...it sounds like the real decision making
                        was the Department of State, the Pentagon, and the CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it wasn't the Johnson White House weighing in that
                        particularly area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Not particularly. I certainly was not aware of that. There were
                    Greek-Americans who were influential in the Johnson administration, but
                    presumably some of them would have been against the coup as well. I think,
                    generally, the Greek-American community was split, the majority disliking
                    Andreas Papandreou, but with a minority supporting him. But in any case, the
                    junta was not popular, particulary initially. So, I think the one thing that was
                    anticipated, the Johnson administration would not support any enterprise which
                    would involve military intervention. It was never tried, but I remember when
                    this proposal came in, and I thought, “Hey, you know that's an interesting
                    idea.” It was shot down immediately by people at a much lower level saying that
                    this would not fly, and we were told to draft a cable telling the Embassy to
                    make sure that the King understands that there is no, repeat no possibility of
                    military intervention, in case he was thinking of it.</p>

                <p>OWENS: Yes, I'm not saying that there wasn't a valid intellectual argument for
                    not doing that. But in any event, whether we might have done something less than
                    military intervention but a much tougher line, it seems to me we would have
                    protected our long term interest in Greece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could comment. It seems that there's two
                        roles, there are different roles. One is, the State Department is supposed
                        to look at the long term political implications. The military has a tendency
                        to look at the very short term, and the CIA also tends to look at the short
                        term. Was this your impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Yes, I would say so. Their fear and perhaps a basic conservative bias on
                    the part of the agency, and particularly the military. I think the dislike of
                    Andreas and what he represented was much stronger there, inside the agency, and
                    certainly among the military because they were getting this from an anti-Andreas
                    line all the time from their counterparts in the Greek military. So, they
                    considered it (the coup) unfortunate, but not that great a tragedy, and probably
                    thought of it as the lesser of two evils that a right wing dictatorship took
                    over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I arrived there in 1970 and there seemed by that time a
                        rather close marriage with both our military officers, many of whom were of
                        Greek extraction, and of the CIA, with the Papadopoulos regime. It was not a
                        distant relationship. I'd say probably our Embassy was odd person out on
                        that, in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: That's right. But we had had, as I mentioned, we had excellent contact
                    with the previous government, the Papandreou government, and also with the
                    government of Stephanopoulos, because they had been the outs for so long that
                    many of us had cultivated close relationships with their people, [and who were
                    at the height of power when they were overthrown], whereas we didn't know the
                    military at all. I had no military contacts, except this one general whom I
                    knew, but that was unique.</p>

                <p>OWENS: I was the senior staff assistant for the Assistant Secretary for
                    International Organization Affairs, who was at that time Joseph Sisco.
                    Naturally, Joseph Sisco, being Joseph Sisco, had two staff assistants rather
                    than just one. I was in that office for actually a year, almost precisely, yes.
                    Pretty much as the chief paper shuffler, and making sure that the various
                    branches of IO got their papers in correctly and on time to Joe Sisco and also
                    to Arthur Goldberg who was our Ambassador to the UN at that time. It was an
                    interesting year. Joe Sisco is not the easiest person to work for, but I found
                    it interesting. I wouldn't have wanted to do it for more than a year. Joe Sisco
                    is a very hard driving, very ambitious man. We never became close during the
                    time we were there. Dave Popper was his deputy, whom I liked very much, later
                    Ambassador to Cyprus, who was, quite in contrast to Joe, easy to work for, quite
                    understanding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Sisco...what was his method of operation? I heard
                        many Sisco stories. I was wondering whether you... He was very much the
                        Washington operator.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Yes. He was, as you know, a senior Foreign Service officer who had never
                    served abroad. He had a rather autocratic style at early staff meetings, he was
                    very hard driving and had an encyclopedic-type mind. Seldom smiled, drove the
                    staff rather hard, but I thought, ran a crisp and efficient operation. He was
                    very tough on bureaucrats, although he was a master bureaucrat himself.
                    Actually, there are very few interesting stories that I can tell about Joe
                    Sisco, except I was disillusioned my departure from the organization, because at
                    the end of the year, after serving loyally, working ten, twelve hour days almost
                    continuously during that time, he said one day to me the final week: “You know,
                    we've got to have lunch and talk.” So I said: “Fine, anytime it's convenient to
                    you.” So, finally the last day that I was to be there, he said: “OK, this is it,
                    we're going out to lunch.” And then he said: “Look, why don't we have lunch at
                    my place instead of going out to a restaurant?” I said, “OK, fine.” So we got
                    over to his house in Westmoreland Hills, just outside the district, and it turns
                    out that nothing's prepared and Joe began rummaging through the refrigerator and
                    says: “Gee, I forgot to get anything,” and finally he got a jar of peanut
                    butter, and a couple of stale pieces of bread and then we sat down to have
                    lunch, and after about fifteen minutes he said: “Gee, I promised my wife” (who
                    as you may or may not know was a Vice President of Woodward &amp; Lothrop's, a
                    very successful career woman) “I promised her I'd take our dog to the vet.” So,
                    after a very brief lunch of peanut butter and bread, we went to the
                    veterinarian. I waited outside while Joe took the dog in. That took about twenty
                    minutes or so. So then we came back, and he said: “Well, we'd better get back to
                    the office.” That's probably the thing I remember most about my leaving the

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>OWENS: Yes, I would say that Joe Sisco treated him with a degree of respect that
                    he didn't accord most people. They seemed, at least on the surface, to have a
                    pretty good relationship. As you say, Goldberg was a power in his own right.
                    Although I was closely associated with him on a work basis, I never got to know
                    the inner Joe Sisco, so I don't know. He never took me into his confidences. So,
                    I never knew what he really thought of Goldberg, but he treated him with
                    considerable respect and seemed to have an harmonious relationship.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OWENS: That's right. I opted for Finnish training, and from '68 to '69, I was in
                    Finnish training, and then went as Political Counselor to Helsinki. The
                    Ambassador had been Tyler Thompson, but by the time I arrived it was Val
                    Peterson, former governor of Nebraska who had been in Eisenhower's cabinet. He
                    was a very interesting and jovial politician whom I liked. I served there for
                    two years. The government in power was a center party, primarily agriculturally
                    based and the president was Urho Kekkonen. I served there two years and then
                    went to Princeton for senior training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the American interests in Finland at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: It was quite a contrast after serving in Greece, where we were so much in
                    the picture and such a power behind the scenes. In Finland, you'd have to say
                    that it was the Soviet Union that had considerable clout and was a power behind
                    the scenes. It took some adjusting to realize that, although we were important
                    symbolically for Finland, we didn't... Since Finland was not in NATO, Finland
                    was a neutral country. It had a treaty of peace and friendship with the Soviet
                    Union, and had to mind its p's and q's very much with the Soviets, their big
                    neighbor to the south and east, so that it was an interesting experience to see
                    the contrast. We were of course important for the Finns, not so much in trade,
                    but as a kind of symbolic other force which served as a counterweight to the
                    Soviets. The Finns themselves were not at all pro-Soviet, as one might expect,
                    having had a number of wars with the Soviets, with Russia and later with the
                    Soviet Union. Two times, they fought during the World War II period, a Winter
                    War and then a Continuation of War which they lost, although I believe they were
                    one defeated country during World War II which was not actually occupied. So,
                    that was a great benefit to them. Although the Soviets did occupy a couple of
                    bases, they did not occupy the country as a whole, and take over the government.
                    In the years after the war Finland did a remarkable job of meeting the Soviet
                    reparations requirements, which in term freed up the base areas that the Soviets
                    occupied. So the Finns, in private, were extremely friendly and quite
                    pro-American. It is interesting to note...I remember reading the statistics at
                    the time, that of the numbers studying foreign languages, (other than Swedish
                    which is not considered a foreign language) that 85% studied English, another
                    5%, German, and 4%, French, and then less than about 1% studied Russian, which I
                    think was an indication how people felt.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>It was a rather uneventful tour. It gave me an inside into Scandinavian,
                    specifically Finnish politics. It had none of the excitement of service in
                    Greece. In fact, as I look back now, as we talk, I guess that the high point of
                    my career was really serving as a junior officer in Greece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think that this is true for many of us. You take
                        your peaks and lows where they come for the excitement level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any flak from the Finns regarding the Vietnam
                        War? The Swedes were adamant on this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>OWENS: Relatively little. As you probably know, I served subsequently in Sweden
                    as political counselor, in Stockholm, so I was able later to make a contrast.
                    No. In contrast to the Swedes who did not have a Soviet problem, the Finns had
                    this problem of coping every day with the Soviet Union, trying to maintain their
                    neutrality against Soviet pressure. Finland was not the rich country that Sweden
                    was, to afford the kind of luxury of worrying about South Africa and Vietnam. We
                    did have an occasional, listless type of demonstration outside the Embassy. It
                    never got out of hand, never a major problem. And the Finns were very scrupulous
                    at the United Nations, in sitting on their hands on every dispute between East
                    and West. They would not vote with the Soviets. They generally abstained on
                    East-West issues. They handled the Korean problem for example by not recognizing
                    either regime when I was there. It was not until a Social Democratic government
                    came in some years after I left that they eventually did recognize both Koreas.
                    We had very little flak from the Vietnam War. I think most Finns wished us out
                    of there primarily for our benefit and the world benefit of our being
                    disengaged, but they were not critical of us, at least, not except from a pro
                    forma basis. The Finnish diplomatic interest during that time was focused on
                    convening a conference on security and cooperation in Europe, and that was
                    something for which they pushed very hard, and which they eventually were to
                    realize. The Foreign Minister, Ahti Karijalainen, was very keen on building up
                    Helsinki as an international center. This was very important for them to make
                    more legitimate their neutrality. They wanted to achieve the status of Geneva,
                    or Vienna, for Helsinki, because they felt that their neutrality was...while
                    they were firmly persuaded of it, committed to it, that the Soviets might not
                    always respect it. They wanted to build up a kind of international acceptance of
                    Finland's neutral role. I remember often presenting the Finnish case to our
                    people in the European bureau. Although Finland was part of the European bureau,
                    since it was not a part of NATO, it was really pretty much out of the center of
                    action. My job was trying to persuade them to look benignly upon Finnish
                    requests to enhance their neutrality. There wasn't a great deal of interest,
                    particularly among people rather who took a very hard line and felt that anyone
                    who wasn't a hundred percent with us was against us. It was after I left
                    Finnish, and the year of Senior Training at Princeton, that I became desk
                    officer for Finland and Sweden.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this from '72 and '74. What were the main

                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Sweden was the main issue, again. It was during the period that we
                    interrupted our relations with Sweden. We didn't actually break off relations
                    with Sweden. In '72, during December 1972, the B-52s bombed Hanoi. Olaf Palme
                    was then Prime Minister of Sweden, denounced this as an atrocity, worse than the
                    massacre at Sharpeville.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which happened in South Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>OWENS: In South Africa, yes. I remember a Saturday afternoon in December being
                    called in to the State Department, along with Scott George who was our Office
                    Director of the Bureau of Northern European Affairs, and with U. Alexis Johnson,
                    and we called in the Swedish Ambassador, De Beche, who was planning to leave in
                    just a couple of weeks. We had to search all over for him. He turned out to have
                    been at a shopping mall doing his Christmas shopping. That would show the exact
                    date, I would say the 17th of December. He was to leave in two weeks. So the
                    poor fellow was summoned in to the State Department and then Alexis Johnson, who
                    was the Acting Secretary, read him the riot act and said that obviously Sweden
                    did not value its relationship to the United States, judging from the
                    intemperate remarks by Olaf Palme. Therefore, Johnson continued, the Ambassador
                    who had already been named by the Swedish government, De Beche's successor,
                    would not be welcome in Washington. Moreover, that our Charge who by chance
                    happened to have left on leave, John Guthrie, would not be going back to Sweden
                    which would leave the mission in the hands of the third man, the political
                    counselor who would act as Charge. So, for the next year and a half, my work was
                    primarily devoted to damage control in Washington, trying to prevent the
                    administration, which was the administration of President Nixon, from completely
                    putting our relationship with Sweden down the drain. The word from the White
                    House was that no one above an office director level could see the Swedes. So
                    lots of people the Swedes had been calling on suddenly closed their doors to the
                    Swedish mission. So Scott George and I were the ones who dealt exclusively with
                    the Swedes, with the Charge. His name was Leif Leifland, who later became
                    Swedish ambassador to Great Britain. It reached absurd lengths during that year.
                    Nixon, apparently, personally felt very strongly about this. Kissinger was his
                    National Security Advisor, and William Rogers was the Secretary of State, and
                    the word coming out of the White House was: “Be nasty to the bastards.” So,
                    Scott George and I drafted a paper, which proposed, and this was accepted, a
                    “cool but correct” policy towards the Swedes, (reminiscent of our initial policy
                    towards the Greek junta) and we would not disrupt any of our ongoing military
                    relationships with the Swedes, but that no high level visitors could go to
                    Sweden, that in Washington, no one higher than the Office Director would receive
                    them, until such time as the Swedes showed that “they valued” their relationship
                    with us.</p>
                <p>So that's how we went throughout most of 1973. Now, things began to change for a
                    couple of reasons by the fall of 1973. Kissinger became Secretary of State, but
                    before that during his questioning by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a
                    couple of Senators said: “Hey, what about relations with Sweden. This isn't good
                    for us to be having this so-called 'cool but correct' relationship. We share a
                    lot in common with Sweden, they're an important neutral, etc..” It was clear
                    that the Swedes wanted a normalization of relations. Palme was
                    uncharacteristically quiet during 1973. In addition, Kissinger met Liv Ullman,
                    the Norwegian actress, but who played extensively in Ingmar Bergman films...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, she was with the United Nations Children's Fund. So
                        she was a major personality and an international figure, not just the
                        movies.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>OWENS: That's right. She met Kissinger at a dinner party in Los Angeles, or
                    Hollywood, I guess it was, and came on very strongly for returning to normal
                    relations with Sweden. But I think the pressure of Hubert Humphrey and Claiborne
                    Pell who both had Swedish connections, Humphrey because of Minnesota, and Pell,
                    I can't recall, but some family member came from Sweden, and he visited Sweden
                    frequently. So, there was pressure on the Senate from the Democratic side, and
                    the White House wanted to keep the Senators happy. We knew that eventually
                    relations would be restored to normal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think I heard a story to the effect that a Senator asked
                        Kissinger at a hearing: “Why won't you see the Swedish Ambassador?” and he
                        responded, sort of off the cuff: “Well, I'll see anybody. Of course, my door
                        is open to anybody.” And all of a sudden, relations had changed because he
                        had committed himself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Well, he did. He assured the Senators in the hearing that he would look
                    seriously into this question. I can't recall the specific statement you alluded
                    to, but that would be along the lines that relations would be getting back to
                    normal. As I mentioned, it reached ridiculous lengths. In 1973, the US held a
                    competition for high school students throughout the world, to write “What the
                    landing on the moon meant to me.” Some students, one or two, I can't recall,
                    from Sweden were among the winners, and the winners were to receive a piece of
                    moon rock, which the astronauts had brought back from the moon. So, we sent a
                    paper over on that, that the Swedes would also be receiving this, and we would
                    send it to the high school in Sweden. The answer came back: “No, no moon rock
                    for the Swedes,” which was incredible how small the thinking was. These were the
                    cronies...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ehrlichman, and the Nixon administration...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: But once Kissinger got on the bandwagon, and particularly once he became
                    Secretary of State, it was inevitable that we would get back to normal
                    relations. I do remember that when Hubert De Beche, the former Swedish
                    Ambassador left, that Scott George and I were the only ones who went out to the
                    airport to see him off. There was no one there from even Protocol. And during a
                    cold winter day, he departed. Then by the spring of 1974, when we did agree to
                    exchange ambassadors, Wilhelm Wachtmeister was made Ambassador to Washington,
                    and again Scott George and I went out there to meet him. I often thought, in
                    later years, Wachtmeister became quite a social person in Washington. He
                    eventually became dean of the corps, playing tennis with Bush and others. I
                    still think of Scott George and myself, and then Wachtmeister invited my wife
                    and me over the next day for lunch, then to see him twelve years later, the lion
                    at social functions, because he stayed on then from 1974 until two years ago. He
                    became dean of the corps. So then, after service on the desk, I went to Sweden
                    as Political Counselor with Strausz-Hup�.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Well, they were pretty well intimidated by the political heat from the
                    White House, and they took a low profile. However, the military was able to
                    continue. We did discourage high level military visits. They were also included
                    in the ban, but the existing military commitments not otherwise spelled out were
                    to go on. Now, as far as the Swedish military were concerned, they were very
                    pro-US. They knew they were never afraid of ever having to defend against the
                    United States. They knew who their potential adversary would be. It would be the
                    Soviet Union. So, they depended upon us for research in their own weapons
                    industry, particularly the aircraft industry. They had their own plane, the
                    Viggen. Even though they depended in part on engine technology, Pratt Whitney
                    and General Electric from the United States, they nevertheless competed with us
                    for the sale, the major sales of the '70s, the weapons sales of the century was
                    to sell to various countries, the fighter aircraft...</p>

                <p>OWENS: That's correct, the summer of '74 and that was when Robert Strausz-Hup�
                    was appointed there, I think I mentioned that some years earlier, Strausz-Hup�
                    was going to Sri Lanka as Ambassador, and picked the Consul General in Athens,
                    Peter Petersen, to go with him as DCM. Strausz-Hup� was a republican stalwart,
                    conservative, and supported Barry Goldwater in his campaign. We were at
                    loggerheads ideologically most of the time I was there. I still remember, when
                    Nixon was forced out of office, that he insisted we cancel all social
                    activities, to go into a kind of mourning. He thought this was a great tragedy
                    for the American republic. Ironically, just to conclude that note, a few years
                    later, when the Democrats came in in 1976, he actually wrote to Vice President
                    Mondale saying that he would like to continue on as Ambassador to NATO, which he
                    was. Rather ironic for someone who had been such an open partisan of the
                    Republican Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Strausz-Hup�'s method of operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Strausz-Hup� is physically a very tiny man. Have you met him? But with a
                    massive ego and he had earlier been Ambassador to Brussels, to the kingdom of
                    Belgium. I remember reading his cables when I was on the Scandinavian desk, in
                    Washington, where he kept saying that Belgium had a unique role to play as a
                    bridge between East and West, etc., and it seemed that wherever he went, he
                    wanted to make it the center of action. So we used to all smile indulgently when
                    we received these cables. So then, when he got to Sweden, he wanted to make
                    Sweden the center, and developed a relationship with Olaf Palme. I used to
                    generally go along with him to his meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How could these two people, conservative and Palme was
                        sort of from the bleeding left?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>OWENS: That's true. But Strausz-Hup� was nothing if not practical, pragmatic. He
                    knew it was to his advantage to be able to say: “I spoke with Palme, today, and
                    he confided to me the following...” I drafted all his cables, he didn't draft
                    himself, but he would give the thrust of what he wanted to say, and he would
                    obviously be in the center of the action. Palme, who was eager for a friendly
                    hand from the US, because he was attacked from the center and right for having
                    jeopardized Swedish relations with the United States. I think most Swedes felt
                    unhappy at the fact. It did bother him a great deal that we had cut off
                    relations. On the one hand, you have this moral fervor, the conscience of the
                    world syndrome that the government had and which was shared by many Swedes,
                    particularly of the left, at the same time, the awareness that whatever happens
                    in the US, happens a few years later in Sweden, because everything from their
                    popular music to their fashion, to their thinking, is completely western.
                    Fortunately, they never imported the violence that we have in our society,
                    unless it was by outsiders. So they felt very unhappy. Even Palme recognized
                    that it was important for him to shore up his right, that the conservatives were
                    very unhappy at this break with their natural ally. So they developed, I would
                    say, a rather good relationship. It was a little difficult for Strausz-Hup�, and
                    for us who were doing the drafting, because while he wanted to emphasize his
                    intimacy with Palme, at the same time, he wanted to show that he was following
                    the party line and being appropriately tough, and chiding the Swedes
                    continuously, because their positions in the UN and elsewhere often differed
                    from our own. He became very interested in Sweden's role in the socialists'
                    internationale. The fact that Sweden and its social democrats were important
                    figures in the socialist movement, but not the communist socialist movement, we
                    played on that a great deal. Strausz-Hup� had a massive ego. He was quite
                    jealous of the contacts of his staff. We in the political section worked very
                    hard to develop our contacts, but we had to be very careful, because
                    Strausz-Hup� was very jealous that anyone of importance be his contact rather
                    than anyone else's.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>We had, during the time I was there, a visit from Kissinger. It was a major
                    event. I recall that there was a plan of the left to demonstrate against
                    Kissinger's coming, and we got a call from Oslo. Kissinger was traveling through
                    some of the other capitals. It was a big event in Stockholm for Kissinger to
                    come. It was, I believe, Bob Funseth who was traveling with him as one of his
                    entourage. “Well, you know, we think we're not going to come to Stockholm, we've
                    heard about these demonstrations that were planned.” So we assured him that
                    nothing would get out of hand, and they said they wanted assurances from the
                    government to that effect. And, moreover, they wanted the Prime Minister out at
                    the airport to meet them. So I relayed that to my Swedish colleagues who had no
                    problem with giving assurances that the Swedish government would control the
                    crowds, but were aghast at the idea of the Prime Minister going to the airport
                    which violated international protocol. To me, it was rather symbolic of the
                    Kissinger ego. So we said: “Gee, we'll do everything to assure there's no
                    problem, but that Mr. Palme cannot go out to the airport. The Foreign Minister
                    would go out there.” Well, they finally agreed. But behind the scene, they were
                    constantly making disparaging remarks about the Swedes, and about Palme.
                    Nevertheless, the visit went rather successfully. It was a major coup for Palme
                    and for the Social Democratic government of Sweden to have gotten Kissinger
                    there. But it was really a non-event in terms of US foreign policy. There was no
                    real rapport between Kissinger and Palme, because of the past. That's why I was
                    quite surprised to see an article written by Kissinger after Palme's death, when
                    he was assassinated, talking about their close relationship. This was a shock to
                    me, after the nasty and mean things that had been said, at least during those
                    years. Kissinger may have changed once he left State. I suspect he did after he
                    went into business and these contacts became necessary for him. So those were
                    the main events of my stay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was, once you got away from these personality
                        problems, your evaluation and impression of Olaf Palme? He played such a
                        major role.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Yes. Well, I think he was quite a brilliant man, ascetic, very austere
                    type of personality. He lived quietly, and was a very shrewd politician and
                    intellectual, really. I think he had a first class mind. I was impressed by him.
                    I used to sit there and take notes, I didn't get to know him personally, but
                    observing him and dealing with people who did know him intimately. He was hated
                    by the conservatives in Sweden. He was born into a well-to-do family, and his
                    wife was considered an aristocrat by Swedish standard. So he was like FDR, a
                    traitor to his kind. I found it a little grating this “conscience of the world”
                    syndrome, but it seemed to be in inverse ratio to the proximity to Sweden to the
                    location of the issue. As some Swedes will remark today that what was going on
                    in Romania, the horrible things there, was never discussed, whereas US bombing
                    of Vietnam, what was going on in South Africa, particularly South Africa, or
                    Spain until Franco was overthrown. So it was a selection type of conscience.</p>

                        Swedish feelings about the Soviets? This was a period, wasn't it, when the
                        Soviet subs were sneaking in and out all the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: It got much worse later, actually. But there was never, in neither Sweden,
                    nor Finland was there ever any affinity for the Soviet Union. I think that the
                    Finns, for example, were fearful of a Soviet invasion. In the case of Sweden,
                    much less, because the Finns had experienced this twice in modern times. In the
                    case of Sweden, there was not that direct fear, but there was very little
                    sympathy for Russian communism. The communist party of Sweden never got more
                    than a small percentage of the votes, 5% was usually its maximum. There were
                    other issues, the Wallenberg case. Oh, that was one other issue that we
                    did...that I worked on in Washington on the desk, to find out what we could
                    about what happened to Raoul Wallenberg.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what that was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Yes. Raoul Wallenberg was in Budapest during World War II, heading the
                    Swedish mission. He had been personally responsible for helping the flight of
                    thousands of Hungarian Jews out of Hungary, and resisting the fascist
                    government, as well as the Nazis, and taking some chances to assist the Jews in
                    fleeing. When the Soviet troops came in to Hungary, they seized him, or rather
                    took him into custody. He has never again been seen. The Swedes made repeated
                    efforts—this was at the end of the war, and the years following—to locate him,
                    and finally when Khrushchev came to power, he said that it turned out that
                    Wallenberg had died in 1947 during one of the excesses of Stalin. They blamed it
                    all on Stalin. Nevertheless, there were rumors by various defectors, people who
                    had been in prison in the Soviet Union, who claimed to have seen a person
                    answering Wallenberg's description. So the Swedes asked us after we began to
                    improve relations, to give them what we could, and we'd check with our sources.
                    At first the White House was reluctant. We had to get their OK. But the White
                    House finally said: “OK, you can do it.” We checked with the agency, and they
                    had reports of people who had been in prison. One fellow who had said that he
                    had been a cellmate, or rather a person in the next cell to his, and that one
                    prisoner had indicated that he was a Swede, tapping on the wall to each other.
                    He seemed to answer to Wallenberg's description. It was pretty vague, nothing
                    very substantial. I personally felt that it was true that he had died if not in
                    1947, probably many years ago. You know there is a group of people in the United
                    States, many of them American Jews, who have formed a committee to save
                    Wallenberg, and are convinced he is still alive, all facts to the contrary, and
                    have been constantly pressing to put pressure, first on the Gorbachev, and then
                    on the Yeltsin government to release details on this, but I think it is a lost
                    cause.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you sort of got out from under Strausz-Hup�. You went
                        to Goteborg from '76 to '78 as Consul General?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>OWENS: Yes. Actually, Strausz-Hup�, to give him his dues, was responsible for
                    getting me that job. The US government decided that it should be opened. In
                    fact, it was Hubert Humphrey who pressed for this. It had been closed in '69,
                    and the Swedes lamented the closing, and also in political terms, it was a sign
                    of the cooling relationship between Sweden and the United States. So Hubert
                    Humphrey made it almost a personal mission to get it reopened. And over the
                    Department's objections it was reopened, and I went down to reopen it with a big
                    ceremony, with the Ambassador. By this time, Strausz-Hup� had left, and David
                    Smith had been appointed by President Ford to be the Ambassador to Sweden. He
                    came down. He was a distinguished Washington lawyer, very affable, very nice
                    man. We both went down and reopened it, to much fanfare. It was a big event in
                    Sweden. Hubert Humphrey was supposed to come, but didn't. A couple of his
                    staffers came out, represented him. There was much excitement in the Swedish
                    press, and so on. This sort of was the icing on the cake, symbolizing the return
                    of full US-Swedish traditionally good relations. That was a fairly uneventful
                    two years for me, however it was very pleasant there. Personally I missed the
                    excitement of dealing directly with the Foreign Ministry. I realized more than I
                    had before how much the action in Sweden was focused in Stockholm. Goteborg was
                    going through a recession at the period. Ship construction was dominated by the
                    shipbuilding of the Koreans and others, and shipyards were closing. Shipping
                    generally was in a recession during this period, so it was rather a sad town. Of
                    course, it is the headquarters of Volvo. I got to know people like Volvo
                    chairman Gyllenhamer, etc. But I found that being a big fish in a small pond is
                    not necessarily as rewarding as being a smaller fish in a much bigger pond.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A more active pond?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: A more active pond. I enjoyed doing the reporting that I could, and the
                    consular work, that we did, the excitement, for the first six months, of setting
                    up a new post. Everything had to be reestablished. You start from scratch. But
                    once that was accomplished, it became just a maintenance operation. So I felt
                    that two years was sufficient. Then, we had a new Ambassador in Stockholm when
                    Ford was defeated. Jimmy Carter appointed Rodney Kennedy-Minott, the California
                    professor who had helped the Democratic Party in California. You know that the
                    Democrats did not win California in '76. In any case, he had been co-chairman of
                    the Carter campaign in California. So he became the Ambassador, we had very
                    amicable relations. So it was a very uneventful two years.</p>

                        women are well represented, that minorities, we're talking mainly of
                        Hispanic and blacks, are represented. What was your impression of how the
                        Foreign Service tried to reach this both to get an elite and, at the same
                        time, to get a fully representative Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: It was a true dilemma. While trying to maintain the classic elite
                    standards, at the same time to make the net as broad as possible to bring in
                    people of different backgrounds, and particularly of different ethnic groups,
                    primarily as you say blacks and Hispanics, because the percentage, particularly
                    of blacks, but that's also true of Hispanics, who had passed the written exam
                    was tiny. I think usually less than three percent of those who took it would
                    pass it. So all kinds of devices were developed, to try to manipulate the system
                    to bring minorities into the service. There was tremendous pressure. I was there
                    first time during the Carter administration, and there was tremendous pressure
                    from on high to bring in more minorities. We were constantly given pep talks
                    about why we had to bring more minorities while at the same time we had to
                    maintain standards. So something had to give, and it usually meant the standards
                    gave. Did you serve on the board of examiners?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes I did. A couple of years before when the pressure was
                        heavy, but not as heavy as when you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Well, they tried various devices. One was something called near-passers.
                    They would take those minority candidates who had scored, let's say that the
                    passing score was seventy, those who had gotten sixty, and bring them forward.
                    But, there weren't that many of them who had near passing scores. So eventually,
                    I forget the word they used, but they created a hypothetical score for them in
                    the written examination based on a look at their college records, and it got
                    pretty basic. If you had a BA, and it was a BA in most any social science,
                    economics, history, or political science, that would say give you a seventy-five
                    or an eighty. So therefore that would be the number you'd take in to the final
                    review panel for their score on the written. Now, the examiners, those who gave
                    the oral examination, never knew who had passed the written and who had not.
                    Quite properly, this information was not given. So that in the oral examination,
                    which as you I'm sure know is no longer three on one.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually I've done both. I came back for a short spell
                        during the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: So you know about the group exercise, the assessment center. So, even
                    there though, the minority candidates did not do as well generally. So there was
                    pressure there at that stage of the process perhaps to give the benefit of the
                    doubt to those who were visible minorities, to perhaps decide in their favor in
                    terms of passing them. Then of course there would be a final effort when you
                    went to the final review panel, in which you took the scores, where you had all
                    the information including the security file. Sometimes for some minority
                    candidates there would be incidents in their past which, if the candidate were
                    not a minority, you would not consider him to be appropriate material to
                    be...such as a conviction, etc. There would be pressure again to overlook these
                    “childhood pranks.” Often they were not childhood pranks, but there was pressure
                    all along to bend the rules to bring in as many candidates as possible. As you
                    know, the procedure today is to reduce the cut score down in order to get a
                    total of, instead of the usual two thousand passers, they get four thousand
                    passers. That way they have caught up a greater number of minorities but
                    unfortunately not very many, very few minorities, at least black candidates,
                    actually took the most recent examinations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It has brought in more women, but not...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: I think the woman issue is settled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think so. I addressed a class of Foreign Service
                        officers of thirty-two, and sixteen were women.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Right, and I'm told that the most recent class of, I think it was
                    forty-one, and twenty-one women, and twenty men. So, I think that issue is
                    settled. Women, generally now, under the new examination, which gives greater
                    weight to verbal skills, do just about as well as the men on the written, and I
                    think do better in the assessments in the oral examinations. So I would think
                    that you're going to have at least one fourth to one third of all appointments
                    going to women which is probably disproportionate to the number of women who
                    take political science, economics, and history, which are the natural studies in
                    examinations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you all react to the pressures from the
                        minorities? You're like a judiciary. At a certain point, there you are, and
                        you come out with a skill that you find, you see what you would consider a
                        marginal, if not a rather weak candidate but who is obviously a minority
                        class. How does this seem to work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>OWENS: Well, speaking for myself, I certainly did not pass someone who I didn't
                    feel was qualified. I thought we should be colorblind. Others did not. We would
                    argue about this. I had other examiners say to me that they thought they felt
                    they had a mandate to pass, but it was never spelled out that clearly to make it
                    a mandate. It was always implicit, rather than explicit. But I think of several
                    cases of a few examiners who told me that they would always bend over backwards
                    to try to bring in minority candidates. I felt that that would be unfair to the
                    non-minority candidates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, there is a problem of bringing in people who really
                        were not up to speed, because in the long run the Service is going to spit

                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Spit out, but after long and torturous grievances. It's a painful process,
                    as you know. Most do not go quietly.</p>

                    means life is miserable for their superiors and colleagues while they are going
                    through that period. I've had many officers on active duty say to me: “How could
                    you people have passed this particular person?”</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>OWENS: That's right. From '80 to '82. It didn't turn out to be a full two years
                    because, after I'd been there about a year and a half, a congressional
                    delegation came down led by a White House functionary by the name of Max
                    Friedersdorf, who was the White House liaison to Congress, and he had been very
                    instrumental in getting the AWAC purchase, the aircraft sale to Saudi
                    Arabia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's the Early Warning Airborne military aircraft?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>OWENS: That's right, for the Saudis, which was considered very important for the
                    administration, and for our defense interests in the Middle East. I remember one
                    of the Congressional staffer saying: “Pay attention to this man. He's very
                    important.” And so, as one does with Congressional Delegates, wined and dined
                    them, and made everything very pleasant for them. Had parties with the Premier
                    and others. In any event, some months later I suddenly got a call from Alan
                    Holmes who was the Deputy Assistant Secretary of EUR. “Oh, I've got some bad
                    news. The White House has decided to politicize the Bermuda position and Max
                    Friedersdorf wants it. The White House is going to announce it. “Well, how can
                    that be? It's always been a career officer... I still have my tour to finish.”
                    “Well, sorry about that. We've argued against it, but the White House is
                    adamant. We want to give you this advance notice, but we don't expect this
                    imminently.” Well, that afternoon I got a call from CBS saying: “What's your
                    reaction? We heard that Max Friedersdorf is going to make this a political
                    position.” So I said: “Too painful to talk about. I don't want to talk about
                    it.” That evening on CBS, it stated that the present Consul General, John Owens,
                    when told that he was leaving his fourteen acre estate, on the beach at Paget
                    Bermuda, said that it was too painful to talk about. Someone in AFSA picked this
                    up, and said, “How could you say this?” I certainly didn't say that it would be
                    painful for me to be leaving this fourteen acre estate. I obviously did not want
                    to dispute publicly the politicizing of that position. AFSA did make a weak
                    protest, however. They were assured by the then Deputy Secretary that this was a
                    one time affair because of the unique services that Max Friedersdorf had
                    performed, that it would return to the career officer position in the future. Of
                    course, that did not happen. As a matter of fact, the White House did a rather
                    atrocious thing. After Friedersdorf had been there a year, he accepted a
                    position as chief of international public relations for Pepsi Cola. But he said,
                    “You know, this might not work out, so...” They kept the seat warm for him and
                    sent a succession of Acting Principal Officers, none of whom could be actually
                    certified as Consul General. It would be the British Government which would
                    grant that since Bermuda is still a colony. So eventually after about a year and
                    a half, it didn't work out with Pepsi Cola, and Friedersdorf came back for
                    another year or so. And then after he left, it was given to another
                    semi-political appointee, Jim Medas who was a California lawyer who had helped
                    in the Bush campaign. And now, it is held by another political appointee,
                    Ebenezer Gaines, a golfing companion of Dan Quayle. So, I suspect, unless the
                    administrations change, it will never go back to the career officer
                    position.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OWENS: Well, the principal concerns were...And I found being Consul General in
                    Bermuda rather, I could even say exciting. We have had and still have, a Naval
                    Air Station which was very important in tracking Soviet submarines in the south
                    Atlantic. There was a movement for Bermudan independence. You know we occupy
                    that base because of our 1940 agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Destroyers for bases?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>OWENS: Destroyers for bases. The lend lease agreement. The US considers that
                    agreement will run till 2039, ninety-nine years of that agreement, but the
                    Bermudans who are pushing for independence said, “No, we would want to
                    negotiate.” So, this movement was of considerable interest to us, which made it
                    from a political point of view, an interesting post. The racial makeup of the
                    island, unlike the Caribbean islands, is only 60% black and 40% white, and
                    traditionally the power lead which had been mostly white. That changed and the
                    change accelerated during my time there. The Premier became a black and most of
                    the cabinet became black as well, the key positions, like the chief of the
                    Bermudan regiment, the chief of police, etc. all were black. It was a fairly
                    harmonious relationship, fairly harmonious, more so I would say than in the
                    United States' black-white relations. So I would consider it a relatively
                    successful multi-racial society. The Bermudans used to speak of themselves as
                    multi-racial, because they also have a large Portuguese colony there, from the
                    Azores, who had originally come in as gardeners and then moved up the
                    socio-economic ladder. It was an interesting make up. The base gave us a
                    military defense aspect to our relationship in Bermuda. It was small enough,
                    it's a small country of sixty-four thousand people. I enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems with tourists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OWENS: There were some assaults, some muggings, a few rapes. As you know, we have
                    a pre-clearance, formal consular officer arrangement with the Bermudans, we had
                    INS inspectors, and customs inspectors stationed in Bermuda, so we had a fairly
                    large INS and Customs contingent. We had NASA stationed there. Bermuda, although
                    nominally British, with a few British traditions, and a British legal system, is
                    very American because something like 85% of the tourists who go there are
                    Americans. The movement between the United States and Bermuda is tremendous.
                    Most Bermudans spend some time in the United States, many are educated there.
                    Every once in a while you see, because they don't need visas, many of them come,
                    stay for an indefinite amount of time, go to universities here, do not bother to
                    get student visas, and since they speak English perfectly, have no trouble being
                    absorbed into the local community. I noticed that a Bermudan woman recently gave
                    birth to quintuplets, or quadruplets in a Washington hospital. The thought
                    occurred to me, “I guess the US is paying for this.” In any case, our relations
                    were excellent. We would have probably had to sign some sort of agreement,
                    defense agreement with the Bermudans. That's the way it looked when I left in
                    '82. Of course the changes in the Soviet Union have lessened the importance of
                    that air station there, the monitoring of the Soviet submarines.</p>

                    earlier for greater minority representation were even more intense. Since then
