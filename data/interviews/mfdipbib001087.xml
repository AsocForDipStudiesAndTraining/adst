                <p>RICHARD SMITH</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Thad Lively</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: November 14, 1989</p>
                <p>Copyright 2003 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: I understand you went to ag school at the University of New Hampshire.</p>
                <p>SMITH: That's right. I got my undergraduate degree in agronomy in 1957, and then
                    I went on for a couple more years and got a master's in ag economics in
                    1959.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you raised in New Hampshire? Is that your home
                        state?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No. I have a rather different background. I was actually raised in Cuba as
                    a child. My father worked for the United Fruit Company in the sugar business,
                    and I was born there. But he was from New Hampshire; my mother is from
                    Louisiana. She's actually a Cajun from Louisiana. So I've time in both parts of
                    the country, but New Hampshire is really kind of home in the United States. I
                    went to high school, college and we still have a place in New Hampshire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the fact that your father worked in an agricultural
                        area havanything to do with the fact that you chose agronomy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. In fact, my father also graduated from the University of New
                    Hampshire in poultry science and went into the poultry business. But the
                    Depression and a few other things caused him to relook his career and he got the
                    opportunity to sign up with the United Fruit Company and went to Cuba. My uncle
                    also graduated from the University of New Hampshire and he went on Michigan
                    State and got his Ph.D. and returned, and he was the head of the horticultural
                    department at the University of New Hampshire. So I've got quite a long ag
                    background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that you went to high school in New
                        Hampshire. Wayour family living there at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>SMITH: No, I had to go to boarding school. It was a small school in Wolfeboro,
                    New Hampshire. It's a private school called Brewster Academy and I did my four
                    years of high school there. In Cuba I went to a one-room schoolhouse; we had all
                    the grades in one room. The most people we ever had in the school was probably
                    15 students. There was no high school there so that's why I had to go to
                    boarding school. I went to boarding school and then I went to the University of
                    New Hampshire (UNH).</p>
                <p>Q: So I guess that's similar to the FAS arrangement if you happen to be in a
                    country that doesn't have facilities for, say, high school aged children.</p>
                <p>SMITH: I think the tendency now is that in most posts they have, or sometimes
                    they send you to regional schools, although you have the option of sending your
                    kids back to the States if you want to.</p>
                <p>Q: I also went to boarding school. I'm from a small town in Kentucky. I'm the
                    youngest child and my parents felt that - my two older sisters had gone away to
                    boarding school and they felt that it was important that we get out and do that,
                    and so if it came down to it at some point in my future at FAS that that was
                    necessary, I probably wouldn't have the negative association that I think a lot
                    of people do about putting their kids in boarding school.</p>
                <p>SMITH: My experience was a very positive one. Wolfeboro was a very small
                    community, people were very friendly and nice. I did miss my parents but that
                    sure made it a lot easier, and it was very positive. In fact, I've never been
                    back to my college reunion, but I did go back to my high school reunion last
                    year and it was wonderful meeting all of my old classmates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have a lot of them stayed in New Hampshire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: They're all over the place. Actually, one of my good friends came all the
                    way back from California with his family. But most are in New England.</p>
                <p>Q: Your undergraduate degree was in agronomy and then you made the switch to ag
                    econ for graduate school. Was that a conscious decision to move more towards a
                    business-oriented career?</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>SMITH: It was two things. I really got interested in economics my last couple of
                    years of college. And the way I got into FAS is kind of an interesting story.
                    Clint Cook at the time was the branch chief for the fruit and vegetable
                    division. Bill Stewart and Bill Rubel - two well-known FASers - were a division
                    director and deputy, respectively. Clint Cook and my uncle had gone to graduate
                    school together at Michigan State. Clint was from Post, Texas, and my uncle was
                    from Guilford, New Hampshire, so you can imagine the difference in backgrounds,
                    but they became very, very close friends. After college they both went their
                    separate ways and hadn't seen each other for about 25 or 30 years. Clint took
                    his family up to New Hampshire for a visit and looked my uncle up. I happened to
                    have just graduated from UNH and was trying to figure out what I wanted to do.
                    Clint convinced me to fly down to Washington to interview at FAS, which I did.
                    And there I found out that getting ag economics would be useful, and I had
                    already thought about it. So, basically, I think that influenced me more than
                    anything to go back to graduate school, and I was fortunate to get an
                    assistantship that paid for most of it and I earned my master's and I came back
                    directly to work for FAS. I think it was a very good decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is an interesting story. There still are some stories
                        like that, but more and more I think— For instance, in my case, I was
                        recruited by a current JP who came to the University of Wisconsin on a
                        campus tour, which I think may be more common.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I think that reflects the maturing of FAS. When I came into FAS, I
                    was in the first junior professional group - I think we were the first or the
                    second, but we were the first really large junior professional group. This was a
                    conscious effort to recruit people out of college. At that time, they weren't
                    very organized in terms of going to schools and picking schools and interviewing
                    people. It was kind of happenstance. But they did set out to hire some people
                    who would be put through a special training program and the idea was that they
                    would make a career at FAS.</p>
                <p>Prior to that, FAS was a new organization. Most of the people had been hired from
                    other agencies within the Department of Agriculture, AID and so forth, and they
                    really had no organized grassroots-recruiting program. Of course, over the
                    years, it's evolved and it's now gotten to be a rather organized,
                    well-structured recruiting program, which is very good, very necessary.</p>
                <p>Q: I think the feeling around the agency now is it's been hugely successful as
                    well. A number of people have been recruited in the last 6 or 8 years. My
                    impression of my fellow JPs is that they're really very capable people and the
                    agency has done a very good job of finding the people who had the kind of
                    backgrounds that meshed well with the career.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>SMITH: A lot of time and effort went into that. During my career at FAS, I was
                    deputy assistant administrator for ag attaches, and then I was assistant
                    administrator for management. All during this time, we put a lot of effort into
                    doing the best job we could to find really good, qualified people. And we had a
                    good product to sell, so that helped a lot. I agree with you. I think FAS, in
                    comparison with other U.S. government agencies, probably has as capable a group
                    as any.</p>
                <p>Q: I had heard from other people - I heard it from Norm Kallemeyn, perhaps, that
                    a number of you were recruited at that time in the late '50s. You came I believe
                    in '58 or '59, and I can't remember which year it was that he said that he came,
                    but it was the biggest class that they've ever had.</p>
                <p>SMITH: That is correct. It was quite a large class. Yes, it was '59 that I came
                    to FAS and we must have had close to 20 junior professionals. People like Dick
                    Bell were in that group. I don't know if you know Dick, but he got to be an
                    under secretary and is now president of Riceland Foods. Jim Ross, Harry Bryant,
                    several people are still in FAS. Since then I think there's been a class of
                    junior professionals every year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did most of the people who came in at that time have
                        backgroundsimilar to yours?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. Mostly ag school or ag economics or marketing. I think that was the
                    first conscious effort to recruit that type of individual for the agency.</p>
                <p>Q: So you told me how you found out about FAS and how you got there. The other
                    question is, what was it that was attractive? I mean, was it in part due to the
                    fact that you had been raised overseas and thought that working overseas would
                    be interesting?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, I clearly had as an objective to go overseas. Prior to meeting Clint
                    Cook, my whole focus was on the private sector, to get with some private company
                    in some capacity. I always had an interest in public policy in college, so when
                    Clint talked to me it attracted me. I went in to FAS with the idea of probably
                    only staying a couple, three, four years to get some experience and maybe try to
                    move to the private sector. But once I got into the agency, I just really
                    enjoyed it and all my assignments were positive and I was always moving forward.
                    Of course, I hit one of the most interesting periods in American agriculture at
                    a time when, all of a sudden, the whole focus changed from an inward domestic
                    looking policy towards an export-oriented policy. And all of a sudden FAS was
                    thrown into the forefront of agriculture, and I just happened to hit it at the
                    right time - very interesting period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to your entering class - we're now called
                        junioprofessionals. Was that a term that was used back then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. JPs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an organized, structured junior professional
                        traininprogram?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Absolutely, yes. It was the first one and we went on field trips, had
                    presentations by the various parts of FAS and other agencies. It was a very well
                    done program to instill in us what the mission of the agency was and what the
                    current issues were, and I thought it was very helpful.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the things that I want to elicit your thoughts and opinions on as we go
                    through in each stage of your career is, the FAS I know is the one with the dual
                    personnel system: foreign service people and civil service people. And clearly
                    the thrust of the recruiting effort the last 5 or 6 years, at least at the
                    professional level, has been to get people who wanted to go into the foreign
                    service. But there was no distinction made, overtly anyway, the time that you
                    were in the agency.</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, it was a selling point. I think most of the junior professionals who
                    came in with me came in with the objective of going overseas. I mean, that's why
                    they selected FAS over a domestic agency. And in its recruiting, that point was
                    always made. But it was a lot less formal arrangement. The notion of going
                    overseas in the ag attach� service that existed at that time was a very informal
                    system. It was almost guaranteed that any JP who wanted to go overseas was
                    eventually going to get an opportunity to go overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I now know why - or I assume I know why you went into the
                        fruiand vegetable division. I mean, that was where your contacts were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It tended to be that way whoever recruited you, got you. Sthat's why I
                    ended up with Clint Cook.</p>
                <p>Q: Thinking back on your experience as a JP, if you could describe in general
                    terms - it was 30 years ago - what was your principal responsibility as a JP and
                    how did that change in the time you were at FAS?</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>SMITH: When I first came into the fruit and vegetable division, they were
                    organized more along commodity lines than functional lines. Even though it
                    showed organizationally on the chart an analysis branch, a competition branch,
                    and a marketing branch, they were in fact organized based on the commodity
                    experience that the individuals had. For example, Clint's specialty was
                    basically vegetables. Stan Maer, another branch chief, had all the tree nuts and
                    dried fruit and so forth. And Bill Stewart did the deciduous fruits. We had a
                    fellow named Henry Burke who was famous around the world as citrus expert, and
                    he did that work. And that's how we were organized.</p>
                <p>Working for Clint, I pretty much concentrated on the vegetables, and I got
                    involved in some analysis work, collecting data, getting to know the business.
                    There was great emphasis in understanding the U.S. industry, which I think is
                    essential. All of the people who were at FAat that time in the fruit and
                    vegetable division came from AMS originally. So they all had strong backgrounds
                    in the domestic programs, be it marketing orders or inspection service, and so
                    forth. So they were outstanding trainers. I think I felt that they were
                    excellent in training you on what the U.S. interest was in these fields. And
                    once you knew that, then you could go overseas and apply your trade because,
                    after all, that's what FAS is supposed to do. I felt that that was very, very
                    well done.</p>
                <p>For example, shortly after I arrived, there was an AID team from Chile that came
                    to the United States to study the California fruit and vegetable industry. Clint
                    wrangled a deal with AID for me to be an assistant leader of the group. The
                    leader of the group was the former president of Diamond Walnuts and retired. He
                    had worked in California agriculture from one end of the state to the other. We
                    spent 9 weeks on a school bus all the way from San Diego to Seattle, Washington,
                    every day visiting various aspects of California, Oregon and Washington
                    agriculture. That was almost like a master's degree in horticulture. It really
                    helped me understand how this industry was organized from production to
                    marketing.</p>
                <p>One of my main assignments was handling the division's work on Mexican winter
                    vegetable competition. At that time Mexican vegetables were really starting to
                    take off and become a major factor in the U.S. market, and I went to Mexico to
                    study the industry and write reports. I was fluent in Spanish because I grew up
                    in Cuba so that was helpful, and I got to become Clint's chief assistant on the
                    subject. I also did some circulars on bananas, I did a study on Mexican
                    strawberries. That was kind of the work I did at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>In fact, one of my most memorable experiences was my first field trip that I made
                    when Clint sent me to Mexico. I had to fly down to Mexico City and meet with the
                    ag attach�, and the embassy people, and all of that. And from there I went to
                    represent the United States Department of Agriculture at the annual meeting of
                    the Mexican Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association. I remember getting off the
                    plane and having all the press interviews and everything, and this was my first
                    visit to Mexico. I remember Burl Stugart was the agriculture attach� at that
                    time; he was quite an interesting guy. I spent some time there and then went on
                    to the actual area with the growers and spent a week and stayed at the home of
                    one of the Mexican growers and got to go around and see how they grew the
                    tomatoes, how they packed them, how they picked them and got to really
                    understand the trade. I got a lot of good information and data and came back and
                    did a report that was published, which was basically of interest to Florida
                    producers who wanted to know how much acreage Mexico had and what commodities
                    and what the outlook was. And after that I continued updating that
                    information.</p>
                <p>Q: That sounds like great experiences. I'm wondering, from where you sat with
                    FAS, how do you perceive the relationships have changed between the agency and
                    the horticulture sector?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I think it's much more complicated. To me the biggest change that's
                    occurred in my years in agriculture - when I first went to work for FAS, and
                    that probably was true up through the early '70s, the rest of the U.S.
                    government really didn't care about agricultural exports. So you operated very
                    independently. You rarely had to go get other agencies to approve anything you
                    did. I mean, it was just almost automatic. The Congress was very supportive of
                    FAS. For the most part, given the strong Congressional support and political
                    power agriculture had, nobody messed with agriculture. So it was a lot simpler.
                    You had one set of objectives and we basically related to whatever it was the ag
                    industry you were working with wanted, and that's what you set out to do.</p>
                <p>That all changed dramatically with ag commodity inflation. When food became a
                    major factor in the CPI, much was made in the press about the so-called grain
                    robbery by the Soviet Union. The Soviets came in and bought a lot of grain and,
                    before we knew it, cornered a good part of the U.S. market supply. As a result,
                    the CPI started going up, and it was blamed on that. All of a sudden, Treasury,
                    and the State Department, and all of these other agencies got very involved in
                    the agriculture business, and since then it's just become more and more so. So
                    trying to operate at FAS is a lot more complicated and a lot more demanding now
                    than it ever had been, in my opinion. You can't just decide something on the
                    basis of what's best for your ag constituents. You really have to work with the
                    whole U.S. government system and that makes it much more complicated.</p>
                <p>Also, with the growth in consumer and environmental movements, the role of
                    agricultural exports has changed dramatically, too. So I would say it's just
                    much more complicated to get things done than it was before.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse my ignorance for a moment. Was the cooperator
                        program iplace at the time you came to FAS.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. Basically, FAS was created as a result of a perception in the
                    Congress that the State Department always put agriculture at the bottom of the
                    list. So several key senators who were very powerful in those days, committee
                    chairmen were exceptionally powerful in those days - just set out to create an
                    agency at the U.S. Department of Agriculture that would be independent of the
                    State Department. The State Department fought that pretty hard but, given the
                    clout that agriculture had in Congress, it was passed. One of the major
                    differences I think between what was done for agriculture versus the foreign
                    commercial service was in the case of agriculture, the whole function was
                    transferred to FAS, including economic reporting, trade policy, trade promotion,
                    the whole sphere was brought in, whereas in the foreign commercial service all
                    they had was trade promotion.</p>
                <p>That was a very critical move because it gave USDA the whole ball of wax, which
                    gave them a lot of clout. At the same time there was a large surplus of
                    agricultural commodities in the CCC and they were trying to think of ways to
                    handle cost. The notion came up and Congress thought “why don't we take this
                    abundance and ship it overseas, and those countries that don't have foreign
                    exchange, let them pay for it in local currencies and then we can reinvest those
                    local currencies in the country.” And PL 480 came out of that. One part of PL
                    480 was a section that allocated a certain portion of those funds for market
                    development. Initially, almost all of the market development work was in the
                    local currencies. Eventually the whole program was converted over to the regular
                    budget.</p>
                <p>Yes, it existed in those days. One of my jobs when I was in the fruit and
                    vegetable division, was to work on an agreement between FAS and a couple of
                    fruit and vegetable coops that wanted to do some overseas market development
                    work. I went through the whole process of setting up the agreements. This
                    program has been very successful over the years in my view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that a big part of what was being done in that
                        division athe time - working closely with the cooperators?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No. The interesting thing was, our particular division leaders were very
                    conservative toward the whole concept of market development and giving all this
                    money to the private sector to spend. They were a very conservative group, and
                    we probably had the lowest level of spending at the time in our agency. But I
                    must say as a result of that, the projects that we did were all very successful
                    because they were very well thought out and our bosses required the industry to
                    really come in with good information. Plus, I think that the fruit and vegetable
                    industry is very good at marketing. They've had a lot of experience, so they
                    really know the business.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Most of the division's interest was in overseas competition and economic
                    analysis, information, and trade policy issues. Those were the focus of the
                    division when I was there. It was basically trade policy, trying to get access,
                    giving information to the trade, and then finally working on competition,
                    finding out what the competition was doing, both in their markets and
                    competition in the United States. Market development had less emphasis than
                    today.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned that the organization's breakout at the time you were in the
                    division - I think I've heard other people say this about the agency as a whole
                    - was analysis, competition, and marketing, whereas now it's analysis and
                    marketing. I'm not sure exactly where competition fits in. Do we have a trade
                    policy program area?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. The way FAS was organized when I first came was by commodity
                    divisions with competition, analysis and marketing branches. I don't care what
                    they are called, the fundamental functions are still there. When new
                    administrators come in, they get different ideas on how to organize FAS.
                    Eventually what happened is analysis and competition were kind of merged into
                    the same function. That's fine because they tend to be pretty much the same.
                    Trade policy was always a major function of FAS, but separate from the commodity
                    divisions.</p>
                <p>I think that Ray Iones, who was one of the first career administrators and lasted
                    quite a while in FAS, is very, very capable guy. He took trade policy and really
                    brought it to the forefront mainly because of the European Community being set
                    up in the '60s, and he foresaw a lot of the problems that we are dealing with
                    now. So that's what really got the trade policy issue at the forefront - the
                    European Community and agriculture's concern about what implications that would
                    have to future U.S. trade. I don't think anybody even came close to imagining
                    the problem that it would be, but everybody sensed that as the EC closed its
                    borders that internal EC production would increase and that the U.S. would
                    probably lose markets. I don't think that anybody ever dreamed that the EC
                    would, in fact, become a major exporter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you've said what this adds up to mean is that a
                        junioprofessional today has had a very good training experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: And according to the information that was given to me, you were given your
                    first overseas assignment after you had spent just over two years in the agency,
                    even though there was a hiatus in the middle for military service.</p>
                <p>SMITH: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that the Berlin crisis? What was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: At that time they had different types of programs that you could sign up
                    for in the Army. I signed up for one where you went through only six months of
                    active duty, and after that you had to spend a number of years in the active
                    reserves going to weekly meetings. My hiatus in FAS was during my active duty
                    service. I graduated from college, joined FAS, got married and went into the
                    army all in about a 60-day period. Then I came back to FAS in the same job and
                    just continued on my career.</p>
                <p>Q: Today I would guess the norm for JPs coming in would be to spend four to five
                    years in Washington before going out. Was your experience fairly common for that
                    time?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Oh, yes. In fact, there was a major effort to try to get young JPs out as
                    fast as they could. There was no problem at all. FAS was expanding overseas and
                    it was natural - contrary to now where you have a contraction of positions
                    versus and expansion of professionals. We had the opposite. New posts were being
                    opened all the time and they were hustling around trying to get people. So I was
                    very fortunate to hit it at that time.</p>
                <p>Q: Part of the thinking must have been that there is no substitute for the
                    training you would received at post. You could spend so much time in Washington,
                    but you're still never going to get a perfect-</p>
                <p>SMITH: It wasn't an easy transition at the time because the fruit and vegetable
                    division was fighting pretty hard to keep all the people that it recruited. They
                    kind of felt that they had recruited all these people and trained them, and they
                    really weren't all that ecstatic about having them leave and go overseas. But
                    they also recognized that that was part of the attraction of FAS. My feeling was
                    it was just a question of the ag attach� service needing to fill positions and
                    looking for whom they felt was the person that would do the job. And most of us
                    were going out as assistant attaches to work for senior ag attaches who were out
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a structure at the time for postings? That's the
                        nexseries of questions I have. You had Spanish, so-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It was very loose. Basically, an area officer would talk to you and say we
                    want to send you to - in my case, Bogota, Colombia. Once the decision was made
                    that you were going to go, you went through the fundamentals. You had to have a
                    medical. You needed to be cleared medically, and then when that was done you
                    were put into FSI training for language if you needed it. In my case, I didn't
                    because I was fluent in Spanish. But then there were some courses you went to
                    which were sort of the introductory to foreign service life, and these types of
                    things. There was also some area studies on the part of the world you were being
                    assigned to.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>And then they had what they called a consultation period where, in essence, you
                    visited all the divisions and they briefed you on what they were interested in
                    in the country. It was very loosely structured. It's nothing like it is
                    today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of your assignments were in Latin America.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that the result of some design on your part?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No. I never asked for a post in my life. I was told where to go. Colombia
                    came up and I accepted it, and I was there two years. When El Salvador was open,
                    I was asked if I'd go there, and I said sure, so I went there. And then Bogota
                    opened again so they sent me back to Colombia. And then from there I was brought
                    back to be the deputy assistant secretary for ag attaches and after that I went
                    to Mexico. When I came back from there I was assigned to be the assistant
                    administrator for management, and from there to administrator. I just think it
                    was one of those circumstances where you're at the right place at the right
                    time. FAS expanded very rapidly, and there were great opportunities for anyone
                    who wanted to take them. I just happened to be lucky at the time.</p>
                <p>Q: The next question I have written down here is, did your earlier overseas in
                    Colombia and El Salvador live up to your expectations? And how did your wife
                    take to living overseas and being a diplomat's wife?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I enjoyed it. I loved my overseas assignments. I can't say anything
                    else. I was particularly fortunate in Colombia when I went. It was a time when
                    Colombia was picked by the Kennedy Administration to be the key country in the
                    Alliance for Progress Program in Latin America. So there was quite a large
                    embassy contingent and very highly motivated and qualified people there. And I
                    got to be very friendly with many of my State Department colleagues. And
                    agriculture was a very key sector, and I really got to work, not only on the
                    traditional FAS work of market development and so forth, but I was able to
                    really get into the whole policy side of the embassy work. I worked very closely
                    at times with the DCM, economic officer and that type of thing. It was a very
                    interesting and exciting time. So I enjoyed it enormously.</p>
                <p>My wife had never been overseas. We didn't have children at the time, so she took
                    it upon herself to go to an intensive course at the University of the Andes in
                    Bogot� to learn Spanish. She became quite fluent. In fact, they asked her back
                    to teach English. So she really got into the language and culture. Once that
                    happened, she was just fine. She really enjoyed it very much, too. We enjoyed
                    all of our overseas assignments.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Q: In general, I'm wondering what the political environment was like and how that
                    affected your day-to-day work. You mentioned that you were able to take part in
                    some of the policy-related work that was going on in the embassy.</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, as I've said, the whole focus of the mission in Colombia at that
                    time was development. There was a huge AID contingent and my challenge was to
                    keep the U.S. ag export interest up front. But I felt in order to do that, it
                    had to be presented in terms of the overall policy of the mission in order to
                    get country team support. I was very fortunate to have some very good people
                    there who were quite interested in agriculture, particularly the ambassador. So
                    I got involved in a lot of assignments while I was in Colombia.</p>
                <p>For example, coffee - I ended up doing most of the coffee work across the board,
                    not just reporting the numbers but actually writing the reports on the impact on
                    development on foreign exchange and the economy. I had the opportunity twice to
                    go with the ambassador to meet with President Lleras just to talk about coffee
                    issues, and I did a lot of reporting on thathat type of thing, which I thought,
                    was rather great for a young guy to be doing those types of things. I got
                    involved in a lot of briefing sessions and things of that sort.</p>
                <p>El Salvador was totally different because it was basically a competition post at
                    the time. It was a small country. I also covered Nicaragua. It was even a lot
                    less formal than Colombia. You got to know everybody in the country, all the top
                    officials. In El Salvador, everybody knows everybody else and it was really
                    quite an interesting assignment. And agriculture just about dominated the whole
                    scene at that time. And the ambassador was a guy called Raul Castro, which was a
                    rather interesting name for a U.S. ambassador. He was a former judge out of
                    Arizona who had quite a bit of interest in agriculture, and we got along very
                    well so I just spent enormous amounts of time working with all factions of the
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>I guess the point I'm making, I was very fortunate that they were willing to
                    allow me to function as truly the agricultural man rather than just the FAS man.
                    In other words, almost anything that came up with agriculture they would think
                    of me, have me included, most of the times assign it to me and let me
                    coordinate, that type of thing. That made it quite interesting because you got
                    involved in all kinds of things that were a lot broader. So I felt that it was
                    really pretty good training, not only in understanding all of the programs at
                    the Department of Agriculture, but you really got to understand a lot of the
                    other agencies' interests and what they were trying to do with foreign policy,
                    and trade, and economics. I think later that was helpful to me in jobs back here
                    in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Mexico was a totally different post. Mexico is, in my view, one of the most
                    interesting posts you can have at FAS. I know a lot of people like Europe and
                    they like Japan. But Mexico is a big market, so you have all of the market
                    development aspects. In fact, it is one of our largest importers of agricultural
                    commodities now. It's an enormous competitor. You have all the border issues
                    that are going on daily. In addition, USDA has an enormous non-FAS presence down
                    there, with programs to eradicate screwworm, and to eradicate hoof and mouth
                    disease, all your plant quarantine issues. So it's really, I think, a
                    fascinating place. And I think the potential in a country like Mexico is great.
                    So I just loved Mexico. We really enjoyed that.</p>
                <p>My only downside is that they didn't let me stay awhile. I would have liked to
                    stay a lot longer. Kenneth McDaniel retired and David Hume replaced Ray Iones as
                    the administrator. Dave had a vision and that whoever was going to go into job
                    of management had to have had overseas experience. Dave felt that that was
                    essential in order to be able to understand all of the problems that the
                    overseas people had and to be able to adapt the management people to them. And
                    he very persuasively convinced me to come back and take over the job. I probably
                    would have preferred to stay in Mexico. In fact, I probably would have taken a
                    demotion and salary cut to stay there.</p>
                <p>But I've got to say that I enormously enjoyed the job after I got into it because
                    I think if there's one way you really want to understand an agency in the U.S.
                    government is to get into management. It's not the most exhilarating job, but it
                    really gets to the heart of U.S. government, how it operates, how it functions,
                    and I think that it's very useful. When became administrator, that experience
                    probably helped me more than any other experience I had.</p>
                <p>Q: Thinking about El Salvador and Colombia in particular and to a lesser extent
                    Mexico, one of the questions that enters everybody's mind today is security. Was
                    that as much of a factor then as it is now?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Oh, no. Colombia was always a problem because Colombia had a history of
                    violence. There were certain parts of Colombia that you couldn't travel to. In
                    Bogota itself, personal security, robberies and that type of thing were always
                    the norm. Kidnapings of children were also a real problem. So Bogota was not
                    very pleasant place necessarily, although it was nothing like today. I mean, you
                    never worried about driving around in a car or doing stuff like that. That was
                    not a problem. You just didn't go to certain areas of the country and you took
                    certain precautions in your house and with your children.</p>
                <p>The difference between El Salvador and Nicaragua then and today - I like to tell
                    the story - I used to drive by myself in a Jeep station wagon once a month from
                    San Salvador to Managua and never gave it a second thought. Can you imagine
                    trying to do that today?</p>
                <p>Q: The survival rate would be low, I would think.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>SMITH: There was absolutely no problem. I used to cross Honduras, I used to cross
                    three border points. If I ever had any problem with the car, there was always
                    somebody to help you. I mean, there was just never any thought of personal
                    danger doing something like that at that time. So you can see how dramatically
                    that's changed.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the issues that I want to try to bring up at several points in this
                    conversation in the effect that computers and other forms of mechanization have
                    had on the work that is done in FAS. During your time in the '60s when you were
                    out in Colombia and El Salvador, what was the stage and the status of computers
                    in the agency? Did we have any computers at all? And how did we survive without
                    them? It's hard to imagine today running that agency without a computer.</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, you couldn't today. As I said, the role was much reduced and a lot
                    less complicated. When I first came to FAS, we used to have what they call a
                    statistical pool in each division. You basically had, for the most part, women
                    in there. And the first year I was in the department there was no air
                    conditioning. So you can imagine sitting in Washington in August with the heat
                    and humidity, literally going through every single trade publication they could
                    get from whatever countries were important in trade and horticulture products -
                    most of Europe and Asia. The ag attaches would send those things in, normally in
                    foreign language, and these women would sit there and by hand take the data and
                    put it on sheets, cards, and those became the file. And if I wanted to go in and
                    get what were the U.S. exports of 'x' product to Mexico, they would go in and
                    bring out a card and they would write it all down and give you a card with it.
                    And if you wanted to look up the imports, that's how it was done.</p>
                <p>By the time I came back from overseas, there was a unit set up at FAS that was
                    your first data systems. And they started with very simple types of computer
                    work. Most of it was on trade data, actually being able to get the trade data, I
                    guess, on tapes and converting it to long sheets and that type of thing. It was
                    difficult to get people to start thinking of moving from the concept of the stat
                    pool, manual operation to this mechanized aid. A lot of people felt threatened.
                    Everybody was convinced that computers were not going to work, but it just
                    slowly started taking hold and I would guess in the middle '70s it just
                    mushroomed all of a sudden.</p>
                <p>I had two things happen. The people we hired to bring in were trained in them.
                    They were trained in school and understood how they worked. When I went to
                    college, we didn't have that. But they expected it. All the people who came in
                    wanted to work with the computers and the mechanization and understood how they
                    worked. So it just, all of a sudden, started snowballing and before you knew it
                    we had what we have today. Even to the extent that when I was administrator, we
                    were the lead agency in developing the use of satellites and computers to
                    identify crop conditions and production in key countries like the USSR and
                    China. When I was the assistant administrator for management, we started
                    spending a lot of money on getting the computer center put up, working with ASCS
                    and had some people like Dick Cannon and others who really took the lead in it
                    and believed in it and really built it up to what it is today.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I take it without computers the way that information
                        watransferred from the field back to Washington was basically by pouch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, correct. There were these cards that you filled up with reports and
                    you just mailed them. And when they came in they were taken off. That and, as I
                    said, a lot of official documents. The ag attach� in London, for example, would
                    send the UK agricultural import statistic book published by the UK
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left that up to the people back in Washington to-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: To take them all off and get them into whatever system they wanted by
                    commodity. Another thing was we always subscribed to Reuters, which had a lot of
                    information on it, too. It was just any source you could get data, and you built
                    up a file on what apple imports were, from what countries, months, and it was
                    just rows and rows and rows of file cabinets full of sheets that had this
                    information on it. And any time you wanted anything, somebody had to go and
                    manually do it. It would take forever.</p>
                <p>Q: Your first stint overseas, the two times in Bogota and Colombia and one period
                    in San Salvador, what do you think during that period is your greatest
                    accomplishment, both personally and in terms of the mission of FAS?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I felt that from a personal standpoint, I gained an enormous amount of
                    experience in the business of international agriculture. I really did. I was
                    very fortunate to work with some very outstanding people from the State
                    Department and other agencies. They were outstanding people and for whatever
                    reason were willing to work with me and help me along. And I made some very good
                    personal friends, people who since went on to be assistant secretaries in the
                    State Department, and under secretaries and all of that. So there were very
                    capable people, very good, and I really felt that I grew enormously,
                    professionally during those years.</p>
                <p>And the second thing is that I really do feel that I was able to convince these
                    people that the role of FAS was important, that it was a resource that, if used
                    right, would be very valuable to the overall objective of the mission. And I
                    feel that I was successful in that for the simple reason that they did use me
                    that way. And I think that people that followed me were able to do the same
                    thing. I always felt that that's very important to the to the agency to be able
                    to contribute in the broadest sense to the embassy mission. In the countries
                    that I was in, it is very hard to point to anything that had major impact on
                    U.S. agriculture. I just wasn't in countries that could have that kind of an
                    impact. You did have a lot of success in building markets, but they were all
                    rather small markets for U.S. products.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you see this as a period, presumably, of FAS sort of
                        growinin stature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Finding its role, finding its place not only domestically,but also in the
                    USDA and overseas.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you encounter during your period overseas - and I want to include the time
                    you spent in Mexico City, as well - any problems dealing with the State
                    Department? Any sense of resentment that we had taken away what they used to
                    do?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Oh, yes. But I got the feeling that problems could be overcome very
                    rapidly if people that were assigned took the right approach. It wasn't
                    something that it wasn't possible to overcome. In fact, my experience was that
                    you were welcomed if you wanted to assume that kind of a role. There was no
                    problem. But I think clearly there was always an underlying feeling that
                    agriculture objectives, per se, were negative to the overall foreign policy
                    objectives, i.e. development in agriculture.</p>
                <p>One of my challenges was always to find the right way to explain, for example,
                    why we didn't want a particular policy, to be able to explain it in, hopefully,
                    an intelligent manner. Maybe they'd disagree with you, but at least they would
                    have to admit that you had either a solid substantive argument or a good
                    political argument that they'd have to accept. I mean, we didn't operate in a
                    vacuum. And I found that the people that we dealt with at the State Department
                    in those days accepted that as long as you made your case. You'd run into
                    problems if you just came in and said, “I don't want to do that.” They'd want
                    some explanation. I think, as a result, if you do it that way, after a while you
                    can really start having an enormous impact on the way things are done and have
                    an impact on U.S. ag interests.</p>
                <p>Q: Where we had left off last time, we had covered your time spent in Colombia
                    and El Salvador and you had had a number of examples to give from your
                    experiences there in a chronological sense. We're now up to the point where
                    you've returned to Washington to become deputy assistant administrator for
                    foreign agricultural affairs. The first question I have regarding that was
                    whether the experiences that you had overseas, did they play a big part in the
                    way you approached that job, in dealing with the attaches and making decisions
                    about and dealing day to day with the offices overseas?</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>SMITH: Clearly, the experience you obtained overseas was very critical in being
                    able to carry out that job although it turned out that there was a lot of
                    administrative aspects of it that I really had to learn. There was very close
                    coordination between that office and the personnel office in FAS and the
                    assistant administrator for management's office. So I basically had to learn a
                    lot of that side of it, which I really had not had any experience with before.
                    But in terms of trying to work with the area officers and the assistant
                    administrator in selecting individuals for posts, understanding when there were
                    problems at the posts and trying to work with the management people on how to
                    resolve them, I think having served overseas made a big difference.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the period 1968 to 1972.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was FAS growing overseas at that time or were you adding
                        postduring that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, actually, that was the first time when they started having these
                    different exercises governmentwide to cut back our presence overseas. If I
                    remember correctly, the first one was called BALPA. I can't remember what it
                    stood for; there have been different acronyms for them since then. That was the
                    first one where they were going post by post and getting the embassies to
                    recommend who should be cut and who shouldn't. And we got pretty heavily
                    involved in that and did have a ceiling put on us. It was the first time that we
                    had an actual overseas ceiling and we had to start making some choices between
                    posts. Actually, I think in relation to many other agencies we did fare very
                    well in that, which I think reflected the important of agricultural work
                    reflected in so many posts.</p>
                <p>The one thing that struck me at that time was you could almost run a correlation
                    as to where you had problems trying to keep your staff versus the quality of
                    people you had at the embassy. There was just no question that where you had
                    good people who were considered an integral part of the embassy, in fact in some
                    cases they even recommended more people. But where you had people who weren't
                    doing quite so well... So I think you find that when you get into these
                    exercises, human nature being what it is, the ambassadors tend try to get rid of
                    people that they don't think are doing the job, and it tends to be that many
                    times more than really whether the function is important or not. I'll just make
                    that as a point because I think one of the most important jobs that that section
                    has in FAS is to make sure you get really good people overseas. You can hide
                    incompetence in Washington; it's really hard to do that when you have a small
                    staff at an embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd be interested in knowing a little more about a
                        procedure thawas followed at that time for making the overseas
                        assignments.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>SMITH: There was an interagency group that made the decision. And it could be
                    appealed all the way up to the president. Fortunately, our secretaries of
                    agriculture during that period were very strong supporters of FAS and backed us
                    up strongly and as a result of that we fared very well. We took very minimum
                    cuts. There were some agencies that took pretty heavy cuts. But that philosophy
                    has continued. Periodically, you get these exercises to try to minimize the
                    people overseas and a lot of it was to give to the ambassadors more control of
                    the post. There was a problem in that; other agencies were getting so big in a
                    lot of these posts that they had a hard time controlling it. We had to make good
                    arguments post by post as to why we needed the people. We'd always make our
                    arguments, both in a substantive, overall argument about the need for increasing
                    agricultural exports and how important that is to the agricultural economy and
                    the U.S. economy, and then tried to relate that to specifically what we were
                    doing in the countries to accomplish that and why we needed these people, what
                    their functions were and why we needed them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a result of this exercise, did the agency determine in
                        ancases that maybe we really didn't need as many posts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Oh, yes. We did have to make some cuts, and plus we had been planning some
                    expansions. So when you added the expansions we wanted to do plus the cuts, we
                    had make some shifts in order to take care of the priorities. I think it was the
                    first time that we had to reduce staff and I got the main job of coordinating
                    all the data with the various entities within FAS and spent a lot of time on it.
                    Our administrator at the time, Ray Iones, was very good at making our cases
                    interagency and he got very strong support from the secretary, so I thought we
                    came out fairly well. And then the other thing that I got heavily involved in
                    was always doing the budget work in order to justify additional slots and money
                    in the budget. So I got quite involved with that. That, lots of times, was
                    competing with other parts of the agency because there were ceilings on the
                    other part of the agency. So we were constantly fighting the battle of the
                    ceilings, I used to call it. It used to be quite an exercise trying to get that
                    all established and making sure that the attach� service held its own.</p>
                <p>Q: When you came back from Bogota, did you have an particular ideas in mind about
                    what might be a good next step in your career, or were you just presented with
                    the fact that you would deputy assistant administrator?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I didn't have much choice in the matter. Obviously, it was a tremendous
                    advance and an honor to go from being an attach� in posts like Colombia and El
                    Salvador up to that job. So there was no question in my mind about doing it. I
                    had always assumed that I would go back overseas to a larger post and then would
                    eventually come back to Washington. We were very fortunate that Mexico came up
                    when it did.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Another thing that I got rather heavily involved which I think was the first time
                    FAS really got involved to this extent, was the whole issue of handling all the
                    high-level visitors to the secretary's office and doing all the briefing books
                    and papers. Some of that had been done, but it had never really been done in an
                    organized fashion. It used to be done on an ad hoc basis by different divisions.
                    Ray Iones put this responsibility in the attach� office and we became
                    responsible for making appointments between the office of the secretary and
                    outgoing ambassadors, handling the visit, preparing all the background papers,
                    making appointments, coordinating with the embassies and all that, so I spent
                    quite a bit of time on that, too. That was very helpful to me because I did get
                    a lot of exposure in the front office. I was almost constantly working with
                    Secretary Harden and his people and Clarence Palmby, the under secretary.</p>
                <p>When Mexico came open, I guess because of my broad Latin American experience and
                    my Spanish, I was asked to take that post, and I was delighted. I think Mexico -
                    I probably said this before - was one the finest posts you could have in the
                    attach� service. It's got so much agriculture and it's so close to the United
                    States and so involved in our overall economy, it's really an interesting post.
                    There was a very large USDA/APHIS contingent in Mexico. I had the opportunity to
                    head the negotiations for the screwworm agreement between the Mexico and the
                    United States working with all the APHIS people. And that was quite an
                    interesting experience negotiating that, plus all the trade issues. And the
                    agricultural attach�, my predecessor Bill Rodman, really was one of the
                    outstanding attaches we had. He had done an excellent job of building up the
                    office within the embassy. So when I got there, the ag attach� office in Mexico
                    handled anything to do with agriculture. It was a very integral part of the
                    embassy operation and I fortunately was able to continue that. I had very good
                    relationship with the two ambassadors and it was a very interesting
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned the close ties and working relationship between the Mexicans and
                    U.S. I suspect you had a number, also, because just the geographical closeness I
                    assume you had a number of visitors there that may not have traveled to some
                    other places.</p>
                <p>SMITH: Oh, sure. There was a constant flow of visitors, congressional and other
                    high-level visitors. It was not uncommon to have an under secretary visit. I
                    remember Dick Lyng, he was assistant secretary of agriculture and eventually
                    secretary. Earl Butz came down at least three times, I think, while I was there.
                    So you do have a heavy visitor load. A lot of business people come to Mexico, a
                    lot of them just off the street wanting to get information. Then you had meat
                    inspection. Meat inspection was a very big item in Mexico because they were
                    shipping beef to the States and USDA had to inspect all their plants. We had a
                    very large APHIS contingent. I guess there were probably two or three hundred
                    USDA employees in Mexico, and the ambassador and USDA expected me to know what
                    they were doing. And they were not in a technical sense responsible to me from a
                    policy standpoint; I was the person they had to deal with in the embassy. So
                    that took a lot of time and it was a challenge to make sure it all worked
                    together and no one felt that I was threatening their responsibility in any way,
                    and it worked out very well. There were some very outstanding people there.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>There were many serious trade issues at the time that we got involved in. There
                    was a vegetable issue and the famous court case on tomatoes, and marketing
                    orders was a major issue. Mexico was importing huge quantities of grain and they
                    were having trouble with the railroads and U.S. embargoed the railroads and I
                    had to get involved in a major effort to get that all untangled. It was just
                    constant interesting issues. There was also a lot of involvement with the states
                    of Texas and Arizona and California, so you were constantly dealing with those
                    officials, also, because of all the trade that was going on.</p>
                <p>And livestock was a major operation there. There was a very close relationship
                    with the National Cattlemen's Association and Mexican Cattlemen's Association
                    and all the breeders' associations, so there was a constant activity in that
                    area. So I really enjoyed Mexico very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the ambassadors during your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: They were both career ambassadors. The first one was Robert McBride, who
                    was a crusty old foreign service career ambassador. But he was just outstanding
                    and was one of those ambassadors that if you ever had an issue, you had to be
                    very careful because when you went up with a problem, he right away wanted to do
                    something. He was very supportive. I really thought he was an outstanding
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>Then he was followed by another career ambassador named John JosepJova, who was
                    an old Latin American hand. Again, he was very good, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had no problem in convincing them of the importance
                        oagriculture.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Quite the opposite. They, particularly in Mexico, knew the importance of
                    it. The key there was getting their confidence that you could handle the issues
                    property. And I think that probably continues today in Mexico - agriculture is
                    so key there.</p>
                <p>Q: I'm wondering because of your relative rank, et cetera, and I assume you were
                    more involved in diplomatic and representational activities there than you had
                    been, for example, in Bogota.</p>
                <p>SMITH: Oh, yes. We were constantly accompanying either the ambassador or DCM to
                    meetings with other cabinet officers in Mexico involving agriculture. I just
                    recalled drugs was a big thing at the time and there was a major effort to try
                    to substitute crops for drugs or work on various aspects of that. I got very
                    heavily involved in that with the attorney-general office in Mexico and with the
                    ambassador. So there was just a constant involvement.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Q: How did you find living conditions in Mexico City? Today, I think, foreign
                    agencies are finding it harder and harder to get people to go there because of
                    the pollution and the crime.</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, it was bad when we were there and I guess it's worse now. Clearly,
                    that was a problem. There didn't seem to be a lot they could do about it given
                    all the old cars and buses in Mexico and the fact that it's in a bowl. But we,
                    after a while, got used to it, and everything was so interesting that we kind of
                    tended to ignore it. We never found it to be something that really made us wish
                    we hadn't gone to Mexico. And you could get out of the city rather easily if you
                    wanted to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there from 1972 to 1974.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came back and became the assistant administrator
                        fomanagement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Right. Dave Hume who had been the agriculture counselor in London and
                    Tokyo had a rather strong opinion - he was the administrator at the time - that
                    the assistant administrator for management should have had overseas experience.
                    Prior to that it had always been a professional management type job. I guess
                    because of my involvement in management as deputy assistant administrator for ag
                    attaches and because I had had a good working relationship with management
                    types, he decided to haul me back to be the assistant administrator for
                    management. I admit, at the time, I wasn't all that enthralled about it. I was
                    happy in Mexico and wanted to stay, but there wasn't much I could do about it
                    when called. But I'm really glad I did because I think I probably learned an
                    awful lot.</p>
                <p>When I became administrator, what I learned on that management job was crucial
                    background. It really was helpful. I was very fortunate to have Lou Davis as my
                    deputy. He was a real professional management type and we hit it off pretty
                    well. And I thought we made a very good team because he knew the management side
                    of it really well and I could handle a lot of the relations with the other parts
                    of FAS. And we had some really good technicians down the line. We were fortunate
                    to have Pat Madison as personnel director and I thought that she was just
                    outstanding as were several of the other people at the agency. And I really
                    enjoyed it. In fact, after I got into it, it probably was one of the more
                    enjoyable assignments I had at FAS, particularly because of the people. I really
                    enjoyed the people in management. I think I appreciate them a lot more than
                    probably most people do. Having had to do that work, I appreciate what they were
                    doing and what they were trying to do and how they were helping the agency.</p>

                <p>Interview date: December 1, 1989</p>
                <p>Q: I assume that the assignment that you had in Mexico City was perfect for
                    coming back to Washington and assuming one of the assistant administrator
                    jobs?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, and I think for any young person who has an opportunity to go to
                    Mexico, it's highly recommended as a post for good training because you get
                    everything there, from market development to analysis, to a strong feel of how
                    the USDA agencies operate in these countries. I just feel the Mexico experience
                    was a very, very good one.</p>
                <p>In the assistant administrator job, management was very good. I also had the
                    experience of having to handle a transition of FAS from a Republican
                    administration to a Democratic administration. When the Carter administration
                    came in, after Dave Hume left, I was named acting administrator and I had to do
                    that. And that was a rather interesting experience. I think if you have to do it
                    once, it's enough, but we all survived it. But those are interesting times.
                    We've had a lot of change in administration but most of them had been from the
                    same party. But when you have a different party, it's quite an experience. We
                    ended up with Tom Saylor as our deputy administrator, and he was just
                    outstanding, a rather top-flight guy and very interested in FAS. And then Tom
                    Hughes was the administrator.</p>
                <p>That was the period in which we got offered the opportunity to enter the Foreign
                    Service. I was given the job to coordinate all of that. We had a major seminar
                    in Williamsburg and put together all the issues and had all the key FAS people
                    there to make decision whether we were going or not. We finally did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which year was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Must have been the year after the Carter administration, which I guess
                    would have been '76, '77, somewhere in that timeframe - '77 probably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that's interesting, the decision that was made on the
                        ForeigService well before it actually came into effect. Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>SMITH: What happened was, Harry Barnes who was the director general of the
                    Foreign Service - I had gotten to know him fairly well because he had been
                    ambassador to Romania and was quite interested in agriculture and had come to
                    see Secretary Butz quite a few times, and we had done a lot of work together on
                    things. And apparently they were trying to get a whole series of new benefits
                    into the Foreign Service package, and they had to reauthorize the whole Foreign
                    Service system. I think State strategy was to try to get as much political
                    support as it could up in Congress. They felt that bringing in other agencies
                    and particularly FAS, which they wanted because of the agricultural influence up
                    there. So he came to us and contacted me a couple times and indicated that State
                    was prepared to include other agencies as part of the Foreign Service, and that
                    they wanted agriculture.</p>
                <p>Initially I think our reaction was rather negative. We had always kind of liked
                    the way it was, but he persisted so we finally started having a look at it
                    rather seriously and felt that that was really an agency decision that the
                    employees ought to participate in. So we organized a seminar of all the senior
                    people - it was everything all the way down through branch chiefs, I think - and
                    went off to Williamsburg for about three or four days just to talk about it and
                    came out of there with a consensus to do it. And then we had to work with State
                    and the Congress, and we finally got it authorized. And then after that there
                    was a tremendous amount of implementing that had to be done because we were in a
                    whole new personnel system. So that's where I think Lou Davis and Pat Madison
                    and their staff did an outstanding job getting that all organized and making
                    sure that we didn't lose a lot of the uniqueness that FAS had in the process. I
                    think we were able to protect that. Like, for example, having our own promotion
                    boards and things of that sort, our own examining service. We tried to set that
                    up in a way that fundamentally FAS would control the personnel aspects of it. We
                    wouldn't get sucked up by State Department while at the same time being able to
                    operate under the system.</p>
                <p>Q: So as it was discussed at Williamsburg and back here in Washington, what were
                    perceived to be the advantages of coming under the Foreign Service?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I think the major advantage was that it afforded us the opportunity to get
                    a higher diplomat presence overseas, which I think a lot people perceived as
                    being important because it allowed us to get the counselor and minister ranks.
                    And in Washington we had career ministers. For example, when I was an
                    administrator, being in the Foreign Service I was a career minister in the
                    Foreign Service. That did help a lot because rank is important in interagency
                    dealings. And, in addition to that, a lot of people felt that the benefits were
                    better. Earlier retirement, higher salaries. There were just a lot of aspects of
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>On the negative side there was a lot of concern that you just become part of the
                    Foreign Service. But I think we were able to structure it in such a fashion that
                    that didn't happen. I don't think it's happened. But then you do also have the
                    time in-grade selection out process, which the civil service doesn't have. I
                    think that was a concern to a lot of people. But I think in the end the
                    overwhelming consensus was that the positives outweighed the negatives, so the
                    decision was made to join.</p>
                <p>Q: Of course I haven't yet served overseas, so I really don't have any intimate
                    familiarity with the embassy environment. But I would guess, for instance,
                    earlier when you discussing these efforts in the government to cut back on the
                    size of embassy community in general overseas, I'm wondering whether we would
                    have been able to make a stronger case or heard more loudly - not that we
                    weren't effective - but whether we would have been ever stronger if we had been
                    a foreign affairs agency at that time?</p>
                <p>SMITH: That's hard to tell whether that would have made much of a difference. I
                    think you're right, just psychologically, that it might help to be a part of the
                    system. Then you're not considered as much as an outsider as you were before. I
                    think the main advantages are the title and the direct benefits to employees. Of
                    course, I think it helps some in just operating overseas and integrating into
                    the embassy operation. It just makes it a little bit easier.</p>
                <p>Q: As you know, there's recently been a lot of talk in the agency about problems
                    that are perceived to stem from the fact that we're running a dual personnel
                    system. Was that something that was considered at the time that there would be
                    the potential for tension there between the two personnel systems?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. I think that that was brought up. That's always been there whether we
                    had the Foreign Service or not. When we were just civil service, when I was in
                    the attach� service, there was an enormous amount of competition and tension at
                    times between the concept of those that have overseas experience and those who
                    do not in FAS. And at the time when I first came into FAS and while I was a
                    deputy assistant administrator of ag attaches, the predominant feeling was that
                    the divisions required people who had strong expertise and a lot of continuity
                    in their commodities. In other words, that you needed someone in there who
                    basically was a grain man and had been a grain man all his life and knew
                    everything from A to Z about grain. Whether he served overseas or not had
                    nothing to do with it. That was not important, and those people moved right on
                    up. And it was a fact that most of the commodity division directors and most of
                    the key people at FAS were people with that kind of background predominantly.
                    People overseas were sort of attach�s, they would come back and forth. They
                    never really felt like they had an opportunity to get into these key jobs. And
                    there was a lot of hard feelings on that part of people overseas feeling that
                    they ought to have a shot at these top jobs back in Washington when they came
                    back, and that someone who had worked in Washington all his life really didn't
                    understand the overall mission. We were a Foreign Service agency, and you had to
                    understand the overseas part of it. And it has always been that way.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>So at that time it was felt that the so-called Washington specialists were in the
                    catbird seat and the overseas guys were kind of orphans and then things turned
                    around. And I guess from what I'm hearing now, the shoe is on the other foot. So
                    I think that's very natural. It's like a pendulum going back and forth and
                    you're always going to have that controversy in the agency, I think between
                    those that are civil service domestic and those that are overseas, and how do
                    you mesh that will always be a problem. It's always been a problem in the State
                    Department even though they don't have two systems. Even though they have the
                    same system, they still have that problem.The other thing is that you find that
                    you tend to move up faster overseas because your have more opportunity to get
                    promoted. You always have a problem of whether you put these people back in
                    comparable grades when they returned to Washington. That's always been a problem
                    - a major problem. I don't think they are ever going to go away. It's just part
                    of the challenge of managing the agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that was a problem even before we were Foreign
                        Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: There's no question about it. People are now trying to couch it in the
                    terms of being civil service/ Foreign Service. It's always been a fight between
                    basically the attaches and the rest of the agency.</p>
                <p>Q: Just to back track a bit to the time when you were still assistant
                    administrator for management. Was that the time when FAS started becoming a
                    computerized agency? And, if so, what was your role in that?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. The pioneers of computerization were some other people who started us
                    on that road. Ray Vickery who had been the director of the grain division did a
                    wonderful job and really took the initial responsibility of trying to start the
                    agency on computerization. And Eldon Hildenbrandt was still in the agency. But
                    by the time I got to be assistant administrator for management, things had moved
                    considerably beyond the initial stages. Tom Saylor who was the associated
                    administrator was a strong believer in this whole area.</p>
                <p>And another thing that helped us a lot was we got the responsibility to take the
                    lead in what was called the Lacy program which was taking the LandSat imagery
                    and trying to figure how to use it to forecast crop conditions around the world.
                    And as a result of that, there was a joint effort between NOAA, USDA and NASA.
                    We actually had an office in Houston with quite a few people plus we had a group
                    in Washington. As a result of all of that, we really got some high quality
                    computer people, and the key guy was a fellow called Jimmy Murphy who was a real
                    whiz guy in computers and a lot of experience in the military who had worked in
                    ASCS.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>We were able to combine that function with the FAS function and really expand our
                    capabilities. And Dick Cannon was put in charge of that effort and did an
                    outstanding job. I'd lay it on Murphy, Cannon, and Hildenbrandt who really were
                    the ones that pioneered that whole thing. We were able to get the funding to
                    build the computers, to get all the hardware and then there was a major effort
                    to train people on how to use it and how to integrate it into the agency. All
                    that did happen during my tenure as assistant administrator for management and
                    administrator. Of course I, too, felt very strongly that we had to do it. There
                    was just no question about it. So I supported the effort and worked hard to get
                    the funding for it.</p>
                <p>Q: Well we often comment today that we wonder how the work ever got done without
                    computers. And I think it must not have been as much final product turned out,
                    or it wasn't done as quickly. One or the other because we are completely tied to
                    computers.</p>
                <p>SMITH: You're absolutely right. When I first came - I think I may have mentioned
                    it - everything was handwritten on cards and there was a huge manpower
                    requirement to get everything done. As we exploded into the forefront of
                    agriculture, the international side became so important, there was no way you
                    could continue doing it that way. Fortunately we had some people in the agency
                    who had got us started on that before so that there was some base there that we
                    could expand on. But I'd say that from about the middle '70s is when we really
                    started expanding in a major way. And in culminated with our joint computer
                    facility with ASCS, which is a real fine facility.</p>
                <p>Q: We've already discussed the process that led up to the decision to become a
                    foreign affairs agency, and that's probably, maybe going to be your principal
                    legacy in FAS as administrator. But I don't want to overlook the other
                    accomplishments that you had during your tenure as administrator. If you could
                    talk about some of the other things that were going on during that period.</p>
                <p>SMITH: Oh, sure. I look at my tenure as administrator as a rather interesting
                    period. And the two things that I feel the proudest of are the things that I was
                    able to accomplish during that time, despite the fact that every year I was
                    administrator our exports went down. I think the agency still has a very strong
                    position and reputation because we were able to explain why it was happening and
                    people really felt the agency was trying very hard, and there were circumstances
                    beyond the control of the agency. I think any time you get into that kind of
                    situation, politically an agency is very vulnerable. And I think we came out of
                    that very well because of a lot of capable people.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Secondly, Bud Anderson was assistant administrator at the time and is now the
                    administrator. Bud and his staff worked to put together a policy paper that we
                    got approved by the President and the Cabinet tstart the process of countering
                    export subsidies. I actually went with Secretary Jack Block to a cabinet meeting
                    when we got the authority to make the famous subsidized flour sale to Egypt. We
                    basically tied up the Egyptian flour market for one year and shut down most of
                    the EC flourmills. I think that was the beginning of what is culminating today
                    in trade negotiations. It was a major effort by the United States to really try
                    to turn the EC away from export subsidies. FAS should be proud that it pioneered
                    that whole policy. A lot of people were involved and did an outstanding job.</p>
                <p>During that time, I think FAS had a key role in determining policy in the
                    Department of Agriculture. It was involved with the Secretary and had a front
                    row seat in terms of developing policy. And I think the agency had a lot to do
                    with the 1980 farm bill and getting the Congress to finally recognize that we
                    had to have flexible loan rates if we were going to compete in world markets.
                    That was a major turnaround and I think I can honestly say that the agency
                    probably had as much to do with that as anyone. We fought that issue within USDA
                    with a lot of opposition to that position. We did a lot of speeches around the
                    country pushing it. Jim Parker was one of the key guys in that effort, putting
                    all the analysis together, and slide shows and everything. We did hearings, we
                    did briefings, and we just spent a lot of time organizing that whole thing. And
                    being the spokesman for that side of the issue because there were a lot of
                    others who wanted to go the other way and keep loan rates high and just
                    basically retrench exports. I don't want to say that FAS was the only one that
                    did that, but I sure think we took the lead in it and were key in providing the
                    background that was needed in order to convince people to change. So I feel very
                    proud about that, because I think today we're seeing the positive results.</p>
                <p>We led the way in our foreign relations with both China and Algeria. In the case
                    of Algeria, when the current under secretary of state, Larry Eagleburger - at
                    that time he was the number three guy in the State Department - went into
                    Algeria following the hostage crisis in Iran, as the Algerians were very helpful
                    in resolving that issue. Up until then, there were absolutely no relations at
                    all. While he was in Algeria, he was advised by the Algerians that they wanted
                    to start developing relations in agriculture with the EU. Mr. Eagleburger called
                    Secretary Jack Block and told him we needed to get going on this ASAP. So Jack
                    called me over and we got together with the Algerian ambassador and we agreed to
                    have a group go over there and to start the process, see what we could do.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>I remember going to Algeria, and when we got there and we had no appointments
                    made. It turned out that the ambassador had no direct communications with the
                    Algerian agencies. If he wanted to communicate with them he had to send a telex
                    from the embassy to the foreign office. And then the foreign office would
                    forward it to the ministry of agriculture or other ministry. The answer would go
                    to the foreign office who would then telex the ambassador. The ambassador had
                    probably seen two Algerian officials in two years. We finally did get a meeting
                    and I took a group of cooperators to the meeting. We told them, look, we are
                    ready to start a major project with you on technology, trade and so let's get
                    started.</p>
                <p>We got to the meeting and it was obviously only very low-level Algerian officials
                    at the meeting. But about halfway through the morning, the Algerians realized
                    that we were serious. He stood up and walked out and came back and announced
                    that that afternoon I had a meeting with the number two guy in the ministry of
                    agriculture. The ambassador was very excited because it was the first time he
                    was going to see somebody at a high level. I went with the ambassador and the
                    upshot of it was we got the go-ahead to develop a cooperative agreement in
                    agriculture. The ambassador had a reception for me the next day and only our
                    group and one Algerian showed up. He was a very low-level guy.</p>
                <p>We agreed that Secretary Block would come to Algeria as soon as convenient. And
                    it was six weeks after that we went back with Secretary Block. The ambassador
                    had a reception and I think 9 out of the 12 cabinet officers showed up at it.
                    And with that, our agricultural exports to Algeria boomed. When I left as
                    administrator, we were doing almost $2 billion worth of exports per year. And
                    China was pretty much the same. So I thought that those were real
                    accomplishments that FAS took the lead on, not only from a trade standpoint, but
                    we really pioneered the relations with those countries. That was quite an
                    interesting time.</p>
                <p>I'd say those were the major ones. We did quite a bit with Mexico,too, at the
                    time. We ended up getting some programs going down there.</p>
                <p>Q: You are obviously a career administrator, but we've had political
                    administrators who didn't have any real experience or ties to FAS. If you can,
                    can you explain how that decision gets made?</p>
                <p>SMITH: It's strictly a decision by the secretary. Actually, the way the process
                    works is, the secretary is named first. Then the secretary, working with the
                    White House, picks the deputy secretary and the under secretaries and assistant
                    secretaries. The secretary always has a lot to say about who that is, but the
                    White House also wants to have a say in that. Once those are picked, then it's
                    up to the assistant secretaries (with the approval of the secretary) to pick
                    agency heads.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>In my case, I had been selected by the Carter Administration to go to London as
                    the ag counselor in our embassy. When the Reagan administration came in, I was
                    asked to handle the transition for FAS. They had me as acting administrator when
                    the Carter people left and the Reagan people coming in. The assumption was I was
                    going to be acting administrator and soon as the new administrator was named, I
                    would be on my way to London. Secretary Block unexpectedly asked me if I would
                    be administrator. I've got to admit - I mean, there was no question that I would
                    do it, but I was thinking at the time, London looked real good. I kind of had my
                    mind made up for me. But I accepted it. I might add it took quite bit of
                    pressure at the White House to get me approved. It's not easy to get a career
                    guy into that kind of a job. Despite the fact that Secretary Block wanted me,
                    the White House was having a very hard time with it. In fact, I was told twice
                    that I had been approved and then found out that somebody had gotten to the
                    White House and undone it. And quite honestly, I think the only reason I really
                    got to finally got the job was Dick Lyng who was the deputy secretary and had a
                    very close relationship to the Reagan administration - he had been Reagan's
                    secretary of agriculture in California. Nofzinger at the time was chief of
                    personnel, and he was the one that was having a hard time accepting this career
                    bureaucrat to become administrator. And Dick Lyng went in and talked to Judge
                    Clark who at the time was in the White House and, obviously, a key man. And
                    Clark finally just told him just do it. And that's how I got in.</p>
                <p>So it's a complicated process and it involves the whole political process and
                    it's not an easy thing at times to do. So I think, for example, the fact that
                    Bud Anderson is now there is great. I think, personally, that the agency works
                    better with a career person. And I think most of the constituency that we have
                    feels that way. That it just operates better because we're basically a highly
                    motivated, well-educated, well-trained group of people, and I just think they
                    respond better. That doesn't mean that you can't find a good non-career
                    administrator. There are obviously a lot of good people who are not in the
                    government who could do it. But the agency doesn't work very well when you bring
                    in a political hack. I think it works a lot better the other way.</p>
                <p>I think Tom Kay was excellent. Dick Bell was the one that assigned Tom Kay to
                    FAS. He was the assistant secretary at the time. I helped Tom get established
                    and got to respect him both as an individual and his competence, and also his
                    political skills. When I was named administrator, one of the first things I
                    asked for was to bring Tom Kay back to be the head of the legislative office
                    because I just thought he was super. They agreed to it and Tom came back and did
                    such a good job for us that Secretary Block made him assistant secretary for
                    congressional affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>When I decided to retire after 6 years as administrator, I left the Foreign
                    Service. Secretary Block wanted a smooth transition. He really liked Tom, so the
                    decision was “make Tom administrator.” A very smooth transition resulted since
                    Tom had no problem getting White House clearance. We had the unusual situation
                    that when they announced that I was leaving, they also announced who was taking
                    my place the same day. So I thought that was very well done. And I think the
                    transition to Bud was very well done, too. So I think we were very fortunate.
                    That, lots of times, doesn't happen in agencies, so that's very good and I hope
                    it continues.</p>
                <p>Q: I have a series of questions here which are more just picking your mind
                    somewhat about FAS, but also just about agriculture in general and some events
                    that are upcoming or that are already underway. I think it might be useful to
                    record these as part of this session.</p>
                <p>The first question is, now that you're no longer with FAS but still working very
                    actively in agricultural circles in the private sector, how do you find that
                    other people view the agency? Maybe people that you had not dealt with when you
                    were in FAS.</p>
                <p>SMITH: I think FAS has an outstanding reputation among the private sector and, I
                    might say, among other government agencies. It's very much respected. And the
                    people are very highly regarded. I find that all the time. There's one thing
                    that's happened to the agency and looking at it from the outside I think that
                    the '85 farm bill put an enormous amount of additional workload on the agency.
                    And, quite frankly, I just don't think it was fair to do that without giving it
                    additional resources.</p>
                <p>I think that as a result of that, I think you all know that there has been a lot
                    of criticism by GAO and auditors of the way certain programs have been managed.
                    Certain congressmen are starting to take pretty hard shots at the agency
                    recently.</p>
                <p>My feeling is the opposite - that the agency has done remarkably well considering
                    the load that was put on it with the farm bill. The EEP program and the
                    marketing loan, the dairy buyout program, all that stuff has enormous work. I
                    understand that there is some additional help coming, but I think it's a little
                    late. I think something should have been done to really help the agency. I still
                    think it needs to be done. But all in all, I think the agency has a pretty good
                    reputation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you see FAS' role in the future in international
                        agriculturchanging and, if so, how?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. I think the agency is going to have to start thinking maybe a little
                    different on how to approach this thing. I think the trade policy area will
                    always be what it is. That's not going to change a whole lot. You're always
                    going to have those issues and you're going to have trade negotiations and all
                    of that. I think the analysis doesn't change.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>I always was a strong believer that - and I used to use the analogy that you had
                    to look at FAS as a three-legged stool. If you cut off any one leg, you're going
                    to have a problem with it. The three legs were getting the market access, which
                    is your trade policy - you've got to get the access to the markets otherwise you
                    don't get anything. You've got to know where you want to get access, and how you
                    go about getting the access, and you've got to do a lot of analysis and
                    background. So the analytical function is just as important. And, thirdly,
                    market development.</p>
                <p>So I'd say that the trade policy and the analysis legs, other than more people
                    and using the latest techniques - don't need much change. But the market
                    development is where I think serious consideration has to be given as to how
                    that's approached. Obviously, the cooperator program, I think, will always be
                    there. I think there's a lot of things that might be able to be done in the
                    cooperator program to maybe change some priorities.</p>
                <p>My feeling is that the real potential for market development in the long run is
                    your less-developed countries. That's where your consumption is low. The key
                    there is going to be economic growth. As those countries grow, that's where your
                    enormous potential markets are. I think countries like the Mexicos of the world,
                    Venezuelas, the Algerias, the Chinas, those are where you're going to see the
                    tremendous growth in the future. And in your developed markets, the cooperators
                    need to phase out there and the trade take care of that. That's an ongoing trade
                    that's going to happen based on quality and price competitiveness, and
                    logistics, and transportation and al of that.</p>
                <p>Q: I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on the direction that the Uruguay
                    round seems to be taking on agriculture, and as it relates or doesn't relate,
                    and what you think might be likely to happen in the next farm bill.</p>
                <p>SMITH: In the case of trade policy, I think what the administration would like to
                    get is certainly a laudable goal. But I think it's going be unrealistic to get
                    that major change that fast. I think that, clearly, a lot of pressure is on the
                    export subsidies issue, and I think there will be something done on that. That
                    was started with the Reagan administration and the famous wheat flour sales to
                    Egypt. I think the culmination of a lot of that is that, probably, there will be
                    some agreement on export subsidies. I think it's going to be very difficult to
                    get the Europeans to do away with their variable levies and convert them all to
                    tariffs. I'm not very optimistic about that.</p>
                <p>As far as the farm bill, I don't see much change. I think people are happy with
                    the farm bill and think they will make some minor adjustments on it. It will
                    continue as it is and if, in fact, they can get agreement on doing something on
                    export subsidies and phasing them out, then I think things like the export
                    enhancement program, marketing loans - even though some people say those aren't
                    export subsidies; I think they are - export subsidies will have to be addressed
                    in some subsequent legislation.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>Sugar, which is one area that I deal in a lot, it's really at this point very
                    difficult. I don't know how it's going to come out. As far as the farm bill,
                    you're not going to see much change in the program other than I think there will
                    be provisions to guarantee access levels to the offshore suppliers and probably
                    will have to go with some marketing production controls to do that in order to
                    meet some of the gap issues that have been raised. If there is an agreement on
                    export subsidies, it will be rather interesting how sugar is handled because
                    Europeans have enormous export subsidies. It will be interesting to see how that
                    is handled.</p>
                <p>But I think there has been a change in the world to where it's starting to be
                    recognized that you can't protect agriculture to the extent that it has been.
                    There has to be, over time, a loosening up of the process. You've got to allow
                    supply and demand to work more. To the extent that you want to support farmers,
                    you've got to do it directly and try to minimize interference in the market. I
                    think these are all things that are moving. And I think, eventually, you'll get
                    there. But I don't think it will have with this trade negotiation that fast that
                    you're just going to dismantle it all overnight. But I really do think that's
                    the way it's going. I think what is pushing it is mainly budget. It just costs
                    too much to do it the other way. It's costing the Europeans a lot of money; it's
                    costing us a lot of money. So I think you will start seeing a gradual movement
                    in that direction.</p>
                <p>Q: Another futurist question: Do you see the events in Eastern Europe having an
                    effect on U.S. ag exports? And do you think FAS could have a larger role in
                    those markets?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I think immediately it wouldn't surprise me to see us becoming a major
                    food aid donor to these areas. Even the Soviet Union is having a little problem.
                    It will be quite interesting what comes out of the summit. I won't be surprised
                    to see something out of that on food aid - Poland, obviously. So I would think
                    we'll start seeing that as a major thing.</p>
                <p>I think as those economies develop - you know, you're talking about pretty
                    capable people and a history of being able to make private sector work. So I
                    think, say, 10 years from now, if those countries are really starting to hum
                    economically, they would become pretty good markets for the United States. The
                    problem is that they'll also become competitors. So it's not going to be all
                    positive, but I think net-wise it should be a major benefit to not only us, but
                    to the world. It's going to be another big source of demand for us.</p>
                <p>Q: Finally, as a closing question, if you had it to do all over again, would you
                    have spent 20 years of your life in FAS, and would you recommend a foreign
                    service career in FAS to someone starting out today?</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>SMITH: Oh, no doubt about it. I've thought about that lots of times. And if I had
                    to do it all over again, I can't think of anything I would have enjoyed more. My
                    26 years, which I spent in FAS, were great. I really enjoyed it. I was there at
                    a very key time. I thinking timing was very important because I there during a
                    period when the agency just got, all of a sudden, thrown into the forefront of,
                    not only USDA, but I've have to say U.S. government policy because exports
                    became so important in the economy.</p>
                <p>I was very fortunate to hold some very challenging and good jobs. I certainly
                    would recommend it as a career. And I think what they're dong with salaries
                    right now, if that all goes through, I think it even becomes more attractive for
                    people to go into the service. As far as going into the government service, I
                    sure would recommend it to someone very strongly. I think it's a good agency,
                    and I think there's some interesting work. I don't think that anybody that goes
                    into FAS is going to ever be bored.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, thanks a lot. I certainly appreciate the time you've spent. These are
                    valuable thoughts and reflections to record into future.</p>
                <p>SMITH: Glad to do it. It's been fun.</p>
