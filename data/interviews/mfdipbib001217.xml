                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is August 2, 1995. This is an interview with Harold
                        C. Vedeler on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies. I am Charles
                        Stuart Kennedy. I wonder if we could start with when and where you were born
                        and a bit about your family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Oh, I was born on July 6, 1903, in Waukon, Iowa. It's in the
                    northeastern part of the state of Iowa. My father died when I was three years
                    old. He was a doctor of medicine. He had tuberculosis. For his health, we moved
                    to New Mexico. He died there. My mother brought me back to live with my
                    grandparents. She and I lived with them in a place called “The Old Academy,”
                    right across from the little, brown church near Nashua, Iowa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The famous “little, brown church?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: That's right, the “little, brown church in the vale.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a famous hymn, “Come to the church in the wild
                        wood, come to the church in the vale.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: That's the church where I went to Sunday school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember hearing that hymn when I was a young boy. They
                        used to play it on a radio program in California. I used to hear it every
                        morning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: I know. Then we moved to Clear Lake, Iowa, in 1914. That's in the North
                    Central part of Iowa. I lived there until I went to college in 1922 [at Iowa
                    State University] in Ames, Iowa. I only went there for two quarters, enough to
                    know that I was not meant to be an engineer. So I transferred to the State
                    University of Iowa [in Iowa City]. I got my bachelor's degree there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you major in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Psychology and philosophy. They were in the same department there [at
                    the State University of Iowa]. I know that I had no course in history there. I
                    mention that because I wasn't certain what I wanted to do when I got out of
                    college. I didn't know for sure until two or three years later. I went to the
                    University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wisconsin. I got a Ph.D. in European History
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did you change from psychology and philosophy to
                        history?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Well, I always loved history but I always thought it was easy. There's
                    no use in taking easy courses. However, I had to do something to earn a living.
                    I liked the idea of teaching history, so that's why I went to graduate school
                    and took a major in history there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was mainly in European history?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: I got my degree in modern European history. I specialized in German
                    history and went to Germany in 1932-33 and did research in the Bavarian archives
                    and the Bavarian State Library at Munich.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was an interesting period. What was your impression
                        of Germany at that time? This was when Hitler took power. Now, you have a
                        German name and you had gone to the University of Wisconsin, which is a
                        center for German literature and so forth. When you got to Germany, what
                        were your impressions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: My name is Norwegian rather than German. A lot of the German people were
                    desperate. They had gone through the loss of World War I, followed by the
                    Versailles peace treaty, [the hyper] inflation in 1923. Then came the Great
                    Depression, as the last blow. Of course, I saw a lot of the “Brown Shirts”
                    [SA—Strum Abteilung, or “Storm Detachments”], and the various political parties
                    in Germany. I went to hear Hitler speak. I saw him a couple of times at close
                    range. He was as close as from here to that wall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking of about 15 feet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: I could see what a hold he would have on these desperate people, whose
                    pride had been wounded so severely and who had suffered financial losses. He was
                    a very dynamic speaker—very theatrical, a great actor. He said things that
                    appealed to them. That was how he got a hold on them. I disliked the “Brown
                    Shirts” then and did so ever afterwards.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>I stayed in a “pension” there, with a bourgeois, or middle class family. The lady
                    of the house had to take in boarders to make ends meet. The family which owned
                    the house was sympathetic to the Nazi cause. I wore out my welcome there before
                    I left Germany because, when Hitler came into power [in 1933], I made no effort
                    to hide my opinion that the Germans were making a great mistake if they went
                    with him.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1932 we thought that Hitler didn't have much of a chance [of
                    taking over the government]. It seemed that his position was getting weaker.
                    However, by the end of 1932 his position had grown stronger. Then he and Fritz
                    von Papen formed a coalition which got 52 percent of the vote. However, the
                    Nazis never got a majority vote by themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was there for you as a young American which “turned
                        you off” on Hitler at that particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: I thought he was preaching the wrong course for Germany. I thought that
                    his ideas were wrong about Aryan “superiority” and all that stuff. He sent the
                    German Army into the Rhineland to reoccupy it in 1936. That confirmed my feeling
                    that Hitler would be a dangerous character on the international scene.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Munich, in Bavaria, which was, of course, the
                        heart of much of the National Socialist movement. What was your impression
                        of the “Brown Shirts,” the so-called “Storm Troopers”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Oh, I didn't like them. My reaction to them was very negative. I
                    attended rallies of the Socialists, the Communists, and all political parties of
                    any size, so I had some basis for comparing the different parties. I thought
                    that the National Socialists [Nazis] were a bad influence in Germany and would
                    be bad for the international community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Communist Party at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: They were putting up strong opposition to the Nazis, and so were the
                    Socialists. So I had a certain amount of sympathy for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In beer halls and at your pension did you find that people
                        were trying to “use” you, as an American, or try to get your reactions [to
                        what was going on]?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>VEDELER: Well, not at that time. The more active the Storm Troopers were and the
                    more they exerted their power, the more arrogant they became. That's one of the
                    reasons that I disliked them. The Storm Troopers would shove people around and
                    act as if they had an ordained right to control the public. They were so
                    convinced that they belonged to a superior order of human beings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: I left there in March, 1933, after Hitler had come into power. He and
                    Von Papen had formed a cabinet in January, [1933]. Then they had elections. On
                    March 5, 1933, they had a parade in Berlin. I was there. They were in power by
                    that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you returned to the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: I returned [to the United States] in March, 1933. I went to Germany in
                    July, 1932.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this part of your studies for a Ph.D. degree?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Yes. I went to Germany to do research on the “toleration reforms” in
                    Germany during the Napoleonic period. However, I found that this was such a
                    large subject that I confined it to the “toleration reforms” in Bavaria during
                    the Napoleonic period. I did work in the State Library there in Munich, the
                    State Archives in Munich, and in all of the provincial archives in Bavaria. I
                    studied the original documents in German script. When I got my Ph.D. thesis
                    finished and had my degree, I went out to teach in Idaho and continued to work
                    on the genesis of the “toleration reforms” in Bavaria during the Napoleonic
                    period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the “toleration reforms”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: They involved religious toleration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was ironic that you were looking at something that
                        was about to undergo a tremendous change.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>VEDELER: That's right. Before the French Revolution and the Napoleonic period
                    Bavaria had been a “closed” Catholic state. By the end of the Napoleonic period
                    various [other] religions had acquired a place in Bavaria, thanks in large part
                    to the territorial changes expanding the size of the Bavarian state. So there
                    was a tremendous change in the attitude of the state and in the laws toward
                    non-Catholic [religious] denominations. That is what I worked on.</p>
                <p>Because of this work and my specialty in German history, I was called to the
                    State Department in 1943.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prior to that you had been a visiting professor, working
                        at several universities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: I had taught at the southern branch of the University of Idaho. This is
                    now Idaho Southern University. I also taught at the University of Nebraska. I
                    was brought there in 1941, where I had a position as acting Professor. I also
                    taught at the University of Wisconsin during that period before I came to [the
                    State Department].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period of 10 years between 1933 and 1943 you
                        were basically teaching in the Mid-west about Germany.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: I taught at three universities—University of Idaho, University of
                    Nebraska, and the University of Wisconsin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This area [in the Mid West] has a large German community.
                        My family on my mother's side was named Lackner. They came from Chicago and
                        Wisconsin. They spoke German before they spoke English. Did you find that
                        there was much understanding of what was going on in Germany? You had seen
                        the birth of the Hitler epoch. Did you find that you had a “cause” to
                        preach, in a way, about what was happening [in Germany].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Well, I was sure that the Nazis were a menace, not only to Germany, but
                    to other countries as well. I was afraid that war was going to come, though I
                    didn't know when it was going to come. I certainly didn't hide my opinion that
                    the Third Reich and Nazism were bad for the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: World War II started for the United States in 1941. How
                        did you end up in the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>VEDELER: Just let me mention one thing about my point of view. We had a man come
                    out to the University of Idaho, Southern Branch, by the name of Jonas. He was
                    sort of favorably disposed toward the Nazis. He and I had a conflict of
                    opinion—that shows my attitude. I was brought to the State Department because of
                    my study of the “toleration reforms” in Bavaria. I had spoken at a convention of
                    the Pacific Historical Association about these reforms. I had published an
                    article [on this subject] in the “Journal of Modern History”—the main article in
                    one issue. So the professional historians knew that I was a specialist in German
                    history. For that reason I was brought to the State Department when they were
                    assembling a group of professors to work on papers for the post-war settlement.
                    These were called “policy and analysis papers.”</p>
                <p>Along with many other professors and teachers I came to the State Department in
                    1943. Some of them had come earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By that time I suppose that you could say that the war was
                        taking a more favorable course. We certainly hadn't invaded the mainland [of
                        Europe], but things were looking up a bit in North Africa and we were moving
                        into Italy. There was a feeling that the war was going to come out “all
                        right.” Was there any particular “thrust” that you were getting from the
                        State Department about what they thought that we should do with Germany
                        after World War II?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: That's what we worked on. We prepared all of these papers concerning
                    proposals for dealing with Germany. I remember that I did a lengthy paper on
                    “Denazification” and tried to identify the various categories of Nazis—where you
                    should put the emphasis on getting them out of office and punishing them. That
                    was one example.</p>
                <p>Let me say that we had one division when I went [to the State Department] dealing
                    with these studies for the post-war settlement. Then this was split into two
                    divisions—one called the “Division of Territorial and Political Studies,” and
                    the other, the “Division on the United Nations Organization.” I worked in the
                    first of those two divisions. A lot of these studies were territorial—where you
                    would draw boundaries, what you would do with the Germans in Czechoslovakia, and
                    all that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The “Sudetendeutsche,” and all of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: The Sudeten Germans and where the boundaries should be between Poland
                    and Germany and Czechoslovakia and Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any thought, while you were doing [these
                        studies] that many of the boundaries might be set up by the Soviet Army, or
                        were we thinking in terms of how Europe might look in terms of how the front
                        lines might end up at the end of the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>VEDELER: We worked on a paper demarcating zones of occupation in Germany for the
                    Allied Powers. On that basis agreement was reached with the Russians before the
                    end of hostilities on the occupation of Germany through four zones. It was not
                    anticipated nor intended that these zones should set long-term political
                    boundaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were doing this, did the “Morgenthau Plan” come
                        up, which basically involved turning Germany into an agricultural
                        state?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Oh, yes, there was a lot of attention given to the “Morgenthau Plan.” We
                    in the State Department were opposed to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Morgenthau was Secretary of the Treasury at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Yes. We tried to resist the Morgenthau proposals for dealing with
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling in the Department? Was it felt that
                        these proposals weren't practical, that they wouldn't work, or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Well, we thought that they were too severe, for one thing. It's hard for
                    me to look back now and see what the reaction was, except that the people in the
                    State Department considered [these proposals] too severe by far and might create
                    a reaction which we wouldn't want to see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were doing this, particularly in view of your
                        experience in Germany, was the relatively harsh Treaty of Versailles [after
                        World War I] hanging over you, that [the Treaty of Versailles] was the germ
                        of what turned out to be [one cause] for the rise of Nazism? In other words,
                        if you asked for peace terms that were too harsh, you might just be setting
                        the stage for the next world war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: There was some thought along that line. When we prepared all of these
                    papers, the American Government in general—and the State Department in
                    particular—envisaged, at the end of World War II, a big international conference
                    like the Congress of Vienna or the Versailles Conference at the end of World War
                    I. [It was anticipated] that we would draw up one treaty which would govern the
                    whole of the post-war settlement. However, it didn't work out that way. As you
                    know, there was a number of different conferences which drew up the treaties and
                    agreements.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: World War II in Germany was over in the spring of 1945.
                        What happened to the post-war planners [you were working with]? Did the
                        State Department say, “Thank you very much, and now go home?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: A lot of the professors went back to their respective universities, but
                    some of us stayed in the State Department and were taken into the old-line
                    divisions [of the Department]. Like myself—I entered the Division of Central
                    European Affairs, which at that time dealt with Germany, Czechoslovakia, and
                    Austria. That happened in 1945. About the time that President Roosevelt died
                    [April, 1945] I went over to the old State Department Building to the old-line
                    political division mentioned. We had finished our special work then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the State Department in the
                        spring of 1945 as a place to work and of the people there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: I thought that it was very interesting indeed, and that was one of the
                    main reasons that I stayed there. The atmosphere in the Division of Central
                    European Affairs was congenial, and its chief, Jimmy Riddleberger, a fine
                    officer to work with, welcomed us (myself and two other university historians
                    from Territorial and Political Studies). I had had a taste of history in the
                    making and found the work interesting. I had been engaged in it for two years
                    and I decided I wanted to continue in that line of work. Yet it was a difficult
                    decision to reach, for I loved teaching European history in the universities,
                    and Nebraska had offered me a full professorship to return.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we making any decisions about, for example, the
                        Sudeten Germans and what was going to happen to them? What was done about
                        them, both in terms of planning [during the war] and in the aftermath of the
                        war? How did we view those people? In a way they had been at least an excuse
                        for Hitler to take over Czechoslovakia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: The problem then involved justice and for them to be returned to
                    Germany, since they had played such a part in the Nazi takeover of
                    Czechoslovakia. We felt that they should be sent back to Germany and the land
                    [which they had occupied] should be freed for [the use of] Czechoslovakia.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, we had a military occupation [of Germany], and
                        the military were running things. In Japan, when General MacArthur took over
                        [as the Supreme Commander, Allied Powers—SCAP], he basically cut out [any
                        role for] the Department of State. He cut out everybody. MacArthur was
                        running everything with his own people and would take no direction from
                        anybody. What about Germany? What was your view of the role of the
                        Department of State at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: The [U.S.] Army had political advisers from the State Department.
                    Ambassador Robert Murphy was there, as you may remember, as was Jake Beam. I
                    think that they had an influential role to play regarding what was done in
                    Germany after the end of hostilities. As time went on after the fall of Germany,
                    the [U.S.] Army became more and more independent in the policy they followed in
                    dealing with Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you and others have a chance to get over to Germany
                        and other areas nearby and see what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: I was in Germany for four months. I went over in August, 1945, and was
                    there until December, 1945. The State Department sent over a team to interrogate
                    the Germans concerned with the foreign policy of the Third Reich. During the
                    time I was there, my main subject was how Paul Schmidt, who was the interpreter
                    for the German Foreign Office during the Weimar period in Germany and then for
                    Hitler's government and Hitler personally, after the Nazis came into power. He
                    was a very interesting man and very capable, of course. He was extremely fluent
                    in both English and French. He could speak in either of those languages nearly
                    as well as he could in German, his native tongue. Schmidt had done a Ph.D.
                    thesis in England on Oliver Goldsmith.</p>
                <p>Not only had Paul Schmidt been an interpreter for Hitler, but he had attended the
                    big international meetings or conferences which Hitler had participated in with
                    various foreign rulers. He would be the secretary taking notes at the same time
                    that he was interpreting. We had already captured long records of these meetings
                    which Schmidt had prepared. I had copies of those memoranda when I interrogated
                    Schmidt. I worked for a whole week with him at a camp near Frankfurt, called
                    Oberursel. The irony was that Schmidt had interrogated Prisoners of War from our
                    Air Force in that same camp!</p>
                <p>He had a great sense of irony. He was not a Nazi in any real sense but only in a
                    formal way. He was kind of a bystander, watching affairs as if they were on a
                    stage and taking a very objective view of things. Long before the end of the war
                    he was convinced that Germany was headed for destruction.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you returned to the State Department after spending
                        four months in Germany in the immediate aftermath of the war, what was your
                        impression of where Germany was going at that time? What did you think was
                        going to happen to Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: I had seen what a great plight the German people were in at the end of
                    the war. Many of them depended for survival on food shipments from relatives and
                    friends or trading family treasures for food. They had no gasoline to speak of.
                    They had rigged up little contrivances using [gas derived from burning] wood to
                    drive their vehicles. Wood was the source of fuel. The Germans were in a very
                    serious plight then, but they have a great capacity for resilience. I know that
                    there were people then in the American Army who were very anti-German. Not just
                    anti-Nazi, but anti-German. Some, however, thought that we had fought the wrong
                    country. Even then, as I remember distinctly, there were some who thought that
                    we should have been fighting the Russians, and not the Germans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any opportunity to see what the Russians were
                        doing in “their” part of Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Not at first hand. The Soviets also occupied a zone in Austria, of
                    course. For some years I worked on the preparation and negotiation of the State
                    treaty with Austria. We knew, of course, that the Russians were carting off [to
                    the Soviet Union] all that they could get their hands on from their Zones of
                    Occupation in Germany and Austria.</p>
                <p>We could see how badly they were treating the people in each country immediately
                    after the end of hostilities. As time went on, the way they dealt with the
                    people in their zone in Austria compared so unfavorably with how the Western
                    powers were dealing with the Austrian population that the Russians were finally
                    prepared to enter into a treaty with Austria that would end its occupation.
                    Ultimately, they agreed to the Austrian State treaty, as it was called. The
                    negotiation of that treaty was a diplomatic marathon which lasted until
                    1955.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back a bit. You came back from Germany in
                        December, 1945, and were working in the Division in the State Department
                        which dealt with Central Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This Division concerned Germany, Austria, and
                        Czechoslovakia. This was a tumultuous time in Czechoslovakia, up through
                        1948, when the Communists took over the country. Did we see this coming?
                        Prior to 1948 you were dealing with Central Europe where the Soviet Union
                        and the United States were sort of confronting each other. From your
                        perspective, did the State Department see the Soviet Union as a potential
                        enemy or a threat at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>VEDELER: By 1946 it was already clear that we were going to have great problems
                    with the Soviet Union. That was the time when the Soviet Union prevented Poland
                    and Czechoslovakia from entering the Marshall Plan. I think that that was the
                    real beginning of the discernment that the Soviet Union was really going to be
                    difficult to deal with. I don't think that there was any conception, generally
                    speaking, that there would be a Cold War which would last as long as proved to
                    be the case. There may have been some Soviet specialists [in the State
                    Department] who may have seen farther than any of the rest of us about what
                    might develop with the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Regarding Czechoslovakia, there was basically a coup
                        d'etat, and then there were elections and the Communists took over the
                        country in February, 1948.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: That's right. It was early in 1948.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the State Department follow this situation very
                        closely and was there much concern about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Well, we followed the situation closely, but, as I remember it, there
                    was no anticipation that the Communists were going to take over Czechoslovakia
                    at the time they did. Ambassador Steinhardt, our chief of mission at our Embassy
                    in Prague who was in Washington at the time of the coup, was optimistic that the
                    democratic parties in Czechoslovakia would win the elections and put down the
                    Communists. The charg� d'affaires in Prague had a similar view. Indeed, it was
                    this prospect, we concluded afterwards, that impelled the Communists in concert
                    with Moscow to take over power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How heavily did our concern about Czechoslovakia weigh in
                        the Department of State? Was Czechoslovakia considered an important
                        country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: After the Communists took over Czechoslovakia in 1948, we were beginning
                    to have a clearer perception of what the long-range problem of dealing with
                    Communism would be. The Department broke up the Division of Central European
                    Affairs. For a time it was uncertain where Austria and Czechoslovakia would be
                    in the structure of the Department. Then Czechoslovakia was shifted to the
                    Division of Eastern European Affairs, and a separate Office of German Affairs
                    was set up. The conduct of Austrian affaires was then shifted to the Division of
                    Southern European Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which division did you stay in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>VEDELER: I stayed with Czechoslovakia and went into the Division of Eastern
                    European Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within the State Department there must have been a cadre
                        of people who had been dealing with Eastern Europe in one form or another,
                        going back to the 1930's. Did you find that there were differences of view
                        among these people? Were some of them taking a very hard, anti-Communist
                        line, while others, you might say, took a more “accommodating line”? Were
                        there differences of outlook within the Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: I think that by the time the Communists took over Czechoslovakia and
                    other Eastern European countries there was a pretty unified position in the
                    State Department opposing the expansion of Communism and the influence of
                    Communist regimes. I don't recall any differences of opinion in that regard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There had been an effort during the war, particularly on
                        the part of Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, of getting rid of some of the “hard
                        line” anti-Communists in the State Department, because we were trying to be
                        more accommodating to the Soviets. I was wondering whether there were any
                        lingering after effects of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Not that I recall or noticed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you concentrated on Czechoslovakia for some
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: That's right—Czechoslovakia in the Division of Eastern European Affairs.
                    But soon I was dealing with Poland and the Baltic countries, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our concerns at this time, in the later 1940's
                        about Poland and the Baltic countries? Obviously, the Soviet Army had
                        entered the area and wasn't going to leave. What were the major things that
                        you were concerned with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>VEDELER: In those Eastern European countries we were always trying to find a way
                    to get to the people, to keep them in touch with the West even in the isolation
                    imposed by the Communists, and to exert the influence of the democratic West on
                    the people themselves. For example, we tried to leave magazines throughout
                    Czechoslovakia. I went there later, you know, as DCM [Deputy Chief of Mission].
                    We developed Radio Free Europe as another means of access to the people
                    there—any way that we could, when we saw that this was going to be a long run
                    proposition. We tried to exert influence on the people through the various
                    channels that we could develop.</p>
                <p>When I went to Czechoslovakia as DCM...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have been in about...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: 1955. We had tables out in the Embassy grounds full of magazines. People
                    could come there and pick them up. They were much desired. We did this for some
                    time. Then the Czechoslovak government forced us to stop that. Still, we found
                    ways to spread magazines throughout the country. Whenever we took a trip and
                    stayed at a hotel, we'd leave a pile of magazines.</p>
                <p>I remember that we had a big celebration of Washington's birthday [February 22],
                    when the Embassy [in Prague] was closed. We went up to a little resort town in
                    the northern mountains of Czechoslovakia and stayed there for a couple of days.
                    We took a car full of magazines and left them all over the place. That's the way
                    we did it. Wherever we went, we'd leave magazines.</p>
                <p>Another thing we did was to bring in a [theater company]. A company putting on
                    “Porgy and Bess” came to Prague in December, 1955. This made a strong impression
                    on the local population. We had a big party at the ambassador's residence
                    afterwards and invited all of the Czechs that we were in contact with to that
                    party. It lasted until 6:00 AM. That was another way we had of trying to
                    maintain contact with the people and influence them in a democratic direction—to
                    show how well things were going in the West, compared to how the Czech people
                    were suffering under Communism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to the period before you went out to
                        Czechoslovakia, was there really any feeling that we could “do business”
                        with the Communist governments in Poland or Czechoslovakia? Did you feel
                        that these were very difficult governments to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: We had to have diplomatic relations with them. There was no point in
                    breaking off diplomatic relations. That would have cut off a channel we had in
                    those countries. We wanted to maintain a diplomatic staff in those countries. We
                    didn't like it when they declared anyone on our staff “PNG” [persona non
                    grata—unwelcome].</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>It was always difficult to deal with the governments of these countries. However,
                    we still wanted to continue relations with them. We also had some difficult
                    problems to settle with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were trying to obtain compensation for the property of
                        American citizens which had been nationalized.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: When I was there in Czechoslovakia as DCM, I carried on negotiations on
                    this subject for two years, trying to advance the possibility of a settlement
                    for those whose property had been taken by the Czech government.</p>
                <p>Later, when I was in the State Department after my tour in Prague as DCM, we
                    dealt with the Romanians and Bulgarians on the same subject and obtained
                    settlements. It was one of the principal problems we had with these countries of
                    Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe that it was a long time before we were able to
                        resolve this problem. We would not send Social Security pensions and things
                        like that until we reached a settlement on these matters. However, we
                        eventually reached a settlement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You said that you were involved with the longstanding negotiations leading to the
                    Austrian peace treaty. How did that work out and what were you doing?</p>
                <p>VEDELER: First of all, Francis Williamson and I prepared the original proposals
                    in the State Department in the form of a draft treaty. Other offices in the
                    Department and in other agencies contributed their input, and the draft was
                    thoroughly reworked to serve as our working text in the negotiations. Francis
                    went to London as a political adviser for the opening of negotiations on this
                    treaty. [Later on], I went to Moscow as a political adviser to General Mark
                    Clark, who was High Commissioner for the United States in Austria. He was in
                    charge of the U. S. delegation to negotiate the Austrian treaty. I spent two
                    months there, working on the Austrian treaty and in negotiating with the
                    Soviets. Of course, the British and the French were also involved [in these
                    negotiations].</p>
                <p>After that I went to the Embassy in London and spent a couple of months working
                    on the Austrian treaty. After returning, I was no longer dealing with Austria
                    but was working on Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of General Mark Clark at that
                        time. He was known as a rather imperious general during World War II. How
                        did you find working with him at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>VEDELER: I got along all right with him, although he was difficult to deal with.
                    Francis Williamson had had trouble with him in London. That's one reason why I
                    took Francis' place and went to Moscow [for the Austrian treaty negotiations].
                    Sometimes he was a little imperious and brusque, but I found him in the end to
                    be reasonable and to have Austria's interests very much at heart. I really got
                    along with him quite well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were working on the Austrian treaty, did we have
                        the feeling that this negotiation was really going to work? Did you think
                        that the Soviets were really interested in doing something at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: There were some articles in the treaty which we could negotiate without
                    much difficulty. However, other articles involving Soviet military interests
                    were a different matter. I remember that we had the feeling that the Soviet
                    military were holding up the completion of the negotiations on some of these
                    articles. We certainly aimed at getting a treaty that would work and thought
                    that we would, in time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it generally agreed on the American side that we would
                        settle for a “neutral” Austria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: I think so. I don't really recall any opposition [to that idea],
                    although at first we directed our efforts to obtaining a status for Austria as a
                    liberated state comparable to that of Italy. We were so anxious to get the
                    Soviets out of Austria that we worked hard to complete the negotiations on this
                    treaty. I think there were several factors which contributed to completing the
                    negotiations on that treaty.</p>
                <p>One was the fact, as I suggested before, that the Soviets were showing up in a
                    very poor light in their zone of occupation. They were failing, not only in the
                    view of the Austrians, but on the world stage as well in dealing with the
                    Austrians, compared to the way that the three Western powers were managing their
                    zones of occupation. Secondly, our “friend” who came over here and pounded his
                    shoe...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Khrushchev.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Khrushchev came into power about that time. He was more disposed to
                    dealing with the West than his predecessors had been. Thirdly, Austria was not
                    of such great importance to the Soviets as Germany was. They could afford to
                    give up their position in Austria, whereas they [evidently felt that they]
                    couldn't do so in Germany.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Baltic countries—Latvia, Estonia, and
                        Lithuania? This was part of your responsibility. They had been “engulfed” by
                        the Soviet Union [in 1940], although we had never recognized that. What was
                        the feeling in the State Department. Did we ever think that the Soviets
                        would let these countries go or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Oh, I think that the feeling was that the day would come when they would
                    be free of the Soviet Union. I remember talking to a group of people who dealt
                    with the Baltic countries up in New York on the VOA [Voice of America]. I
                    expressed my conviction that the day would come when Lithuania would be free and
                    that they should have faith in that. If we hadn't felt that, we would not have
                    maintained this policy of not recognizing the incorporation of the Baltic
                    countries into the Soviet Union. That was one of the tenets of our policy in
                    dealing with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe: never to recognize the
                    incorporation of the Baltic countries into the Soviet Union. We always
                    maintained that these “captive nations” would again be independent one day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any people in the State Department who said,
                        “Let's be realistic. These countries are gone, and let's forget about them.”
                        Was there any of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Not that I know of. You know, these countries had funds that we had
                    blocked. Their [diplomatic] missions in the United States were maintained with
                    those blocked funds. We supervised the use of those funds.</p>

                    and I would meet from time to time in the library of his residence for evening

                <p>VEDELER: He carried on his diplomatic functions there as chief of mission. A good
                    deal of his time was devoted to negotiations with the Chinese [Communists] in
                    [Geneva], Switzerland, trying to get American prisoners free. For much of this
                    time I was in charge of the Embassy in his absence. He didn't do anything in
                    “frontal opposition” to the regime [in Czechoslovakia]. He maintained a formal
                    diplomatic position, as any ambassador would in any country. Of course, he was
                    opposed to Communism in every way, as all of us were, and vigorously supported
                    our efforts to maintain contact and influence with the people of Czechoslovakia.
                    Of course, he encouraged the exercise of caution since there was always risk of
                    a contact being an agent of the secret police, seeking to entrap us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Czechoslovakia from 1955 to 1957. What was
                        your impression of the situation there? How did you regard the Czech
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: I could see how unpopular the Communist regime was with many of the
                    people there. I could see what a bad job they were doing, economically speaking.
                    There was so little electricity there that at night the lights were dim when you
                    would drive around Prague. There was very little produce in the markets. We
                    couldn't buy anything to speak of. We had to get our supplies in from Germany.
                    We brought in a truck [of supplies] every month or two months. The truck was
                    loaded with supplies for the whole Embassy staff. In our own house, the
                    residence of the DCM, we had an inventory of $1500 worth of supplies which we
                    always kept.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>There were [local employees] of the Embassy staff who [worked for] the secret
                    police. We knew that some of the local staff were secret police agents. We
                    weren't sure about some of the others, and some, we were sure, were not secret
                    police agents at all. We knew that, at times, they would have to act as secret
                    police informants. They would go along with the secret police to the extent that
                    they had to, and no more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there [in Prague] at a very important time,
                        November, 1956, at the time of the Hungarian revolt. Can you talk about your
                        experiences at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Well, there were some people who said that the same thing could happen
                    in Czechoslovakia. They packed their bags in readiness to go to the border, if
                    there were any chance to do so. That was the case of the family that worked for
                    us in our house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we doing at our Embassy at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: We were trying to find out what was happening in Hungary and what might
                    be the possibility of its occurring in Czechoslovakia. We tried to report on
                    opinion in Czechoslovakia at that time and report whatever pertinent information
                    other Western diplomats managed to obtain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice any extraordinary security precautions
                        being taken in Czechoslovakia at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Not any more so than usual in overt actions. The secret police were
                    everywhere, all the time, anyway, in the city of Prague itself. They were often
                    very much in evidence. For example, just before the musical, “Porgy and Bess,”
                    came to town, the secret police put on a campaign of strictly watching all of
                    the [official] Americans, wherever they went, except for the Ambassador. They
                    followed us around—and obviously so. They kept watch on us where we lived, day
                    and night. This campaign went on for about a week.</p>
                <p>For example, I went to a French exhibition of drawings located in a Czech
                    building. I drove down in an Embassy car, got out, and went in. There was a
                    secret police car right behind me. I went into the building and walked around.
                    Right behind me, like a shadow, was a secret police officer, wearing one of
                    those leather coats. They wore leather coats as a matter of dress. To this day I
                    hate to see leather coats! That's an indication of the kind of surveillance
                    which the secret police maintained on the people. They didn't want any contact
                    between the people and U.S. Embassy officers. Of course, we tried to have
                    contact with the people to get their views and report on them.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Whenever we talked over the telephone, we had to exercise the utmost caution
                    because the phones were probably being tapped. If we needed to make sure a
                    conversation with another Embassy officer would not be overheard, we talked
                    outside buildings or in the security room of the Embassy. We found “bugs”
                    [listening devices] in the attic of our Embassy. The secret police had rigged up
                    a whole system of bugs from a building which had a wall next to the wall of our
                    Embassy. They had bored a hole through the walls of both buildings and then
                    worked in the attic to install this system going down into the ceiling of the
                    rooms below the attic floor. Then they put in a kind of “plug” where they had
                    made an opening to get in. We only found out about this when the Department sent
                    out officers from the Office of Security to see what bugs they could find. The
                    man who discovered the hole in the ceiling was lying on a bed in one of the
                    apartments to inspect the ceiling. He looked up very carefully all over the
                    ceiling—and then he saw the tiny opening of the place where the bug was
                    installed. Then we went up to the attic and found the whole system, where it
                    came from, and where it went to an adjoining wall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As DCM you were responsible for running the Embassy. Was
                        there a problem there, with the Czechs trying to “compromise” our people?
                        Traditionally, they used “sex traps,” black mail, and all of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Yes, they were always trying to do that, one way or another. One of
                    their favorite ways was to have somebody approach us and try to give
                    information. We always had the problem of trying to determine what was genuine
                    in any approach to us or any relationship with a local person and what was the
                    setup of the secret police. That was an eternal problem, because we had to try
                    to collect information from the people to report to the Department.</p>
                <p>I remember one case in particular. An Embassy economic reporting officer had
                    developed a contact who was in touch with the secret police. They caught him in
                    a meeting with this secret agent as the latter passed information to our
                    officer. Our officer was declared “PNG” and had to leave the country. That is
                    what they tried to do whenever they could. Again a police agent seduced one of
                    the Embassy's clerical secretaries by worming his way into her affections from
                    the posed position as a driving trainer and then attempted to control her as an
                    informant in place.</p>
                <p>Whenever the Air and Army attach�s went on a trip, the secret police would try to
                    follow them. I remember going on a trip with our agricultural affairs officer.
                    The secret police had five cars traveling with us. There was one car in front of
                    us and one behind—and one on each side on parallel roads. And they also had
                    another one, for a total of five secret police cars keeping tabs on us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Prague in 1957. It must have been a difficult
                        tour, with all of this security attention.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>VEDELER: Yes, it was. Especially in view of the Hungarian revolt. I think that
                    that event scared the Czechoslovak regime. They were very alert to any sign of
                    something similar happening in Czechoslovakia. They took special precautions in
                    dealing with all of the Western Embassies and their representatives. It was a
                    difficult time right at the height of Communist control over Eastern Europe. I
                    think that the control tightened everywhere in Eastern Europe, after the
                    Hungarian Revolt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you moved to Vienna in 1957?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: I was Deputy U. S. Representative to the International Atomic Energy
                    Agency [IAEA].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for two years, until 1959.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing during this 1957-1959 period at the
                        IAEA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: During that time the International Atomic Energy Agency was established.
                    The various national missions to that agency held meetings with each other and
                    as a board. Those board meetings may have been held once a month and may have
                    been less frequent than that. I often represented the United States at the board
                    meetings. Once a year we had a General Conference [of the agency]. A delegation
                    would come out from Washington, with representatives from the Atomic Energy
                    Agency and the State Department.</p>
                <p>There was a U.S. Representative to the agency. [During my time at the IAEA] he
                    was a newspaperman, a political activist from New Mexico. He didn't live in
                    Vienna. He generally just came for the annual General Conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much activity in the IAEA during the time that
                        you were there, or would you say that this was pretty much a “holding
                        action” during this period from 1957 to 1959?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>VEDELER: So much of this activity of the IAEA and the missions accredited to it
                    was concerned with technical matters and administrative matters within the
                    agency. It was a time when all concerned were busy in shaping the structure and
                    functions of a new UN organization. There was, of course, some politics involved
                    in appointments there—to make sure that the Communists didn't get too much
                    influence in the agency. There was always the background of a difference of
                    political interest between the Soviet Union and other Communist countries and
                    the non-Communist countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have many dealings with the Soviet side—personally
                        and otherwise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Oh, yes, we did. We got along pretty well with them in dealing with the
                    specific problems of that organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I have talked with others who have dealt with the
                        Soviets in this area, many of them have said that, really, American and
                        Soviet policy were pretty much parallel in the atomic energy field—mainly to
                        keep other powers from developing atomic weapons.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Yes, we had some identity of interest in that field and also in
                    promoting and safeguarding the peaceful uses of atomic energy. We often had
                    differences about appointments [to various positions in the agency]. However, on
                    the whole we got along pretty well in that particular area. There was a Deputy
                    Representative from the Soviet Union with whom I frequently dealt. We had
                    excellent personal relations. He had served in New York in the Soviet Delegation
                    to the UN. He had come under American influence [to some extent]. I was sure
                    that this man, at heart, was not a real Communist. He was a career officer. He
                    was doing everything possible to [support Soviet policy] in the interest of
                    career and status. However, he had been deeply influenced by this assignment to
                    the United States. We entertained each other at dinner and so on. In dealing
                    with the officials of Communist states, I tried to act in a thoroughly
                    professional and generally in a personally friendly way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left Vienna and went back to the Department in
                        1959?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: That's right, to the Office of Eastern European Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You stayed there until you retired?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: That's right—for six years [until 1965].</p>

                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Foy Kohler at first, but William Tyler was the head [of the bureau]
                    during most of that time.</p>

                        think that he had served in France and Germany.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Yes, I think that he had mostly dealt with Western Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period from 1959 to 1965 what were your main
                        concerns? For one thing you were there [in the Office of Eastern European
                        Affairs] during the missile crisis [of 1962] with the Soviet Union over
                        Cuba. Did that have any effect on Central Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: I remember that during the missile crisis I was in Eastern Europe,
                    visiting all of the posts that I dealt with. I was in Warsaw at the height of
                    the crisis. From there I was scheduled to go to another Eastern European
                    country. I had to telephone the State Department to see what I should do. I
                    recall that the officers assigned to the Embassy in Warsaw were pretty edgy at
                    that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Office of Eastern European Affairs include
                        Yugoslavia at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the countries where we felt that we might make
                        some ground and gradually wean some of them away from the Soviets? Or did we
                        see any such prospect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: We did everything that we could to encourage Yugoslavia to be
                    independent of the Soviet Union. That was the pivot of our policy in dealing
                    with Eastern Europe. As I recall, we didn't see much hope for any Eastern
                    European country to become another Yugoslavia, though we tried to encourage them
                    as much as we could to show some independence [from the Soviet Union], as in the
                    case of Poland. I think that that was a pretty realistic estimate of what might
                    be done and what couldn't be done at that time.</p>

                        countries the Soviets never seemed to have gotten a tight grip on Poland, as

                        Church was always there and was always powerful. Did you have the feeling
                        that Poland was different, somehow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Yes. Poland was different in this respect. There was a more unified
                    population there in their attitudes because the Catholic Church was so important
                    in the lives of the people. About 95 percent of the Polish people were
                    Catholics, and the Catholic hierarchy in Poland had a great hold on the people.
                    The hierarchy, from priests to the senior Archbishop, was nearly 100 percent
                    anti-Communist. As a result, the situation in Poland was quite different from
                    that in almost any other Eastern European country. There was always a strong
                    base there for opposition to Communism. We were sure that many people in Poland
                    were only Communists in form or for career or job-related reasons.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Yugoslavia? How did we regard Marshal Tito and
                        his government at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: We thought that he had held his country together during and after World
                    War II. Keeping his country unified and on an independent course was a
                    remarkable feat on Tito's part.</p>
                <p>I don't think that anyone in the Department anticipated that Yugoslavia would
                    disintegrate, even after Tito was gone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Yugoslavia at the time of Tito's death. [In our
                        Embassy] we thought that the Yugoslavs were too smart [to let the country
                        disintegrate]. We're talking now about the situation in 1995 and the
                        terrible war which has led to the breakup of the country. It's a great
                        tragedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: I wasn't in the Department during the period after the Soviet Union
                    broke up. However, when I was in the Department, there was no anticipation that,
                    after Tito was gone, Yugoslavia would break up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You retired in 1965?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know if there's anything else that I should cover
                        or not. Were there any other developments when you were working on Central
                        European affairs that you would like to discuss?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>VEDELER: I might mention that during the time that I was in Czechoslovakia
                    [1955-1957], I made a trip to [southern] Poland, to Krakow. It's an attractive
                    town, one of the most interesting in Europe in the survival of its old
                    picturesque structures. This trip was purely for sightseeing. We watched a
                    parade on a Polish holiday. We felt then the sense of solidarity there among the
                    people. It was impressive.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most striking thing during this whole period was the revolt in
                    Hungary [1956] and the effect it had on Soviet policy. It made [the Soviet
                    leaders] “tighten the clamps” on the Eastern European countries.</p>
                <p>After I left the Department, there was this Soviet movement into Czechoslovakia
                    to oppose “socialism with a human face.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That happened in the spring of 1968—the “Prague
                        Spring.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: Yes. I think that the Hungarian Revolt [of 1956] and the Soviet invasion
                    of Czechoslovakia [in 1968] were two of the most important developments, if not
                    the most important of all, in Eastern Europe during the period from 1946 to
                    1989.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'd like to thank you very much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VEDELER: You're welcome.</p>
