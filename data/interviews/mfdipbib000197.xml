                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you can give me a bit of your background
                        before we get into your career as a foreign service officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I am the son of an American father who was a professor at Princeton and
                    a French mother. We always had strong attachments to Europe, spending every
                    summer there. When war came in '39 to Europe, I felt quite strongly on the
                    issues involved and in 1941 I left Princeton half way through my sophomore year
                    and took a boat from Canada to go to England. I arrived at Liverpool on June
                    22nd, the very day the Germans launched their attack- Operation Barbarossa-
                    against the Soviets- a day that brought a great sense of relief.</p>
                <p>I enlisted in the Royal Air Force, actually in a Free French squadron of the
                    Royal Air Force, and spent four years with them, flying a Spitfire. I was
                    fortunate to survive the war. I was shot down two months before the end and
                    became a prisoner of war of the Germans. I was sent to Luftlag Eins, a POW camp
                    for allied air force officers, which was located on the Baltic Sea between the
                    Elbe and the Oder, and was liberated by the Soviet forces. I spent several weeks
                    with them helping repatriate allied prisoners of war and inmates of a
                    concentration camp.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give us an impression of the Soviet forces at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The German guards left the camp on May lst to go West and give
                    themselves up to the allies, rather than wait for the Soviets. A number of
                    allied officers and I just went south to see what we could do for other allied
                    soldiers in the prison camps. We commandeered a truck and drove through the
                    Soviet armies as they were moving up for the last attack. The first division we
                    met was Asian, but I've never known from what republic. It used horse-drawn
                    carts, piled high with bundles presumably of loot and many with a cow or calf
                    tethered behind. Some had a woman perched on top of the bundles. Soldiers walked
                    alongside this caravan. The whole gave a hallucinating impression of the armies
                    of Genghis Kahn, moving into Western Europe, five hundred years later.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>The greater Russians from Leningrad and Moscow clearly showed they felt closer to
                    us than to their Asian compatriots. They would say, pointing to the Asian troops
                    in language we could understand, “Be careful, they've got hot blood.” It was an
                    extraordinarily interesting experience.</p>
                <p>Even in war, the political commissars were visibly present. As soon as the Soviet
                    armies had overrun German territory, the commissars appeared and installed
                    themselves and started questioning people, establishing their control throughout
                    the zone.</p>
                <p>I returned to Princeton in January 1947 and worked straight through to my AB
                    degree in June 1948. I took the foreign service exam in San Francisco in
                    September 1948. Having looked around at job possibilities, I became more and
                    more attracted to the State Department and was pleased to learn in December that
                    I had passed the written exam. I came to Washington and passed the oral in
                    February 1949, but then had to wait until November 1950 before being sworn in.
                    Even then there was a maladjustment between taking in new classes of officers
                    and the budget. I continue to believe that this delay is inexcusable. It is bad
                    administration to bring in young people and then let them stew for months; they
                    are caught in a very difficult situation, in a limbo where they can't build
                    another career, and yet have to fend for themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any problem having been with the RAF?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: No, not really. I had a number of references. My former commanding
                    officer for instance, was a French Colonel who was assigned to the UN Military
                    Committee in New York at the time and helped clear me very quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It happens again and again. Well, you came in 1950?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes I was sworn in in November 1950 and began the initial training
                    course in 1951.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of your class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: It was a wonderful group. A wonderful group. To this day, I consider
                    many to be friends. But looking back, you realize you live in your own times. It
                    was lily-white male. There was not a single ethnic minority. There was not a
                    single woman. I sincerely believe that we were not prejudiced against women or
                    minorities as colleagues, but it simply was a fact of the times that almost only
                    white males applied for the foreign service.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the outlook? Why were these people, including
                        yourself, joining the foreign service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Our class had had essentially the same experience: we witnessed the rise
                    of fascism which led to a dreadful war and coming out of it, felt that World War
                    II could have been avoided, if the US and the Western democracies had shown a
                    little more vigor and energy and belief in themselves. I believe that to this
                    day. I think the war forced our generation to take an active interest in the
                    world just to maintain peace and preserve this country. This view was I believe
                    a primary motivation for going into the foreign service and working in foreign
                    affairs. Most of us having experienced war felt that that was where the action
                    was at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a group whose experience was molded by the armed
                        forces or by seeing the democracies collapse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: And the memory of the great depression. This too was a major factor
                    molding our generation. So we had a mindset very hard on communism which to us
                    was just fascism of the left, and an ethic of hard work.</p>
                <p>Let me just say, I have a very deep sense of satisfaction today, because when you
                    step back and look at the experience of our generation, we really fought for
                    fifty years, an entire lifetime, against the authoritarian regimes of the right
                    and of the left. And we've won. I think that what has happened in the last few
                    months is by way of a vindication of our lives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think all of us take tremendous satisfaction in what has
                        happened since 1989. I hope that all this doesn't turn out to be a false
                        spring. But it is very encouraging.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: There is a whole new set of problems, however, that are going to
                    develop. And very difficult problems. We can identify many of them already. But
                    it is not going to be the kind of harsh life-and-death confrontation that we've
                    experienced, and that forced us to devote enormous resources - time, energy,
                    talent, money - of all our countries to preserve the peace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And to make compromises that we sometimes wished we didn't
                        have to. Moving on. Your first assignment was to Casablanca.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about this and what was the
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I had asked to go to the Middle East because that's where I thought
                    there would be some action. I was sent to Casablanca and I wasn't terribly
                    enthusiastic. I thought, my god this is terrible. I was going out somewhere in
                    left field where nothing happened. But, as it turned out, it was a wonderful two
                    years. It's a beautiful country. It was an introduction to the Middle East, to
                    Islam and to the problems of Moslem societies. And to the dying days of one
                    empire. So it was very instructive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The empire being ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The French. Indeed, I left in '53 anMorocco became independent three
                    bloody years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you. You had a French mother and fought on the
                        French side. Now you are an American vice consul in Casablanca. Weren't you
                        looking at everything with bifocals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I always felt I was an American; I served in the Free French as an
                    American. Speaking French and understanding the French, but as an American, I've
                    never had a problem representing this country. I believe in it and I believed,
                    and continue to believe, in its foreign policies. We've all had our reservations
                    about some aspects of our actions abroad, but, by and large, to this day, I
                    think that the thrust of our policies has been right, and, on the whole,
                    successful.</p>
                <p>In Morocco, I specifically thought that the French were wrong. It was quite sad
                    to observe an otherwise perfectly intelligent people, absolutely refusing to
                    face the reality of the situation. Any foreign observer could see that the
                    situation was slipping out from under their control; that, regardless of their
                    belief that they were absolutely necessary for the country, their days were in
                    fact limited. In a way it was a poisonous atmosphere. You could not get into a
                    conversation with a French person without “ the Moroccan problem” coming into
                    the conversation. They had intoxicated themselves in the belief that they were
                    essential to the maintenance of the country, that the Moroccans could not rule
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any instructions from Washington at this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: There was tension between the American posts in North Africa and the
                    Embassy in Paris. Our colleagues in Paris were of course working with the French
                    government and trying, at that time, to work out a security system, the alliance
                    of NATO. It was essential to develop cooperative relations with all the people
                    of Western Europe. For the French government, the issue of their empire was a
                    major consideration. For those of us who were observers on the ground, in the
                    empire, we could see what was going on and thought it unwise for us to be allied
                    too closely with France, the imperialists, against what seemed evident to us,
                    the wave of the future. So there was an inherent tension between the North
                    African posts and our embassy in Paris.</p>
                <p>Woody Wallner, who was First Secretary at the embassy in Paris, in charge of
                    empire affairs, was our principal adversary. We loved him dearly, and respected
                    him highly, but we were in a continuing struggle with him, to win Washington's
                    soul, as it were. He was putting forth the French case and doing his best to
                    maintain France as an ally in Europe, France which of course played a central
                    role in NATO. We in the empire went a different way, arguing that the US should
                    not be perceived by the natives as supporting imperialism, or at least too
                    wedded to the maintenance of French authority in their countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was part of the great battle over the dissolution of
                        colonies that was fought in the Department and in the field really up to the
                        end of the ''60s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Well no, until independence in 1956.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the battle continued with others. Well now, who was
                        your consul general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: John Madden.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: John was a fairly relaxed, detached individual. He presided smilingly
                    over his post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The junior officers felt more strongly than the senior ones. Q: Were you
                    under any restraints?</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: No. I have always prided myself on being a very professional diplomat.
                    And so, although at one point, a French friend warned me to be careful, because
                    in Rabat, the French authorities apparently considered I was too critical, and
                    had spoken, according to this friend, of declaring me persona non grata.
                    Essentially I was trying to say what I thought in nice terms - that there was an
                    evolution taking place in the world, things were changing and it was wise to
                    adjust accordingly. Even such a mild proposition was taken amiss- which is a
                    pretty good indication of the extraordinary sensitivity of the French at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>The most dramatic event in my two years in Casablanca was the Korean War. It
                    caused a very great rise in anxieties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Korean War started in ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: In June 1950. And I got to Morocco in February of 1951. In the spring of
                    that year, Washington decided that we had to have the means of striking at the
                    USSR. At that time, there was no plane that could reach the Soviet Union from
                    the US. There were no ballistic missiles, of course. The longest range bomber
                    was the B-33. It didn't have the range to reach Russia. The only way we could
                    reach the USSR was to have intermediate bases. So it was decided in Washington,
                    to build five major bases in Morocco.</p>
                <p>Well, in 1951, 1952, there was full employment in the US. The economy was going
                    great guns. There were not many able-bodied, qualified men (women had not
                    entered the work force as heavy equipment operators as yet) to be hired in the
                    streets. The whole program was carried out on an absolutely crash basis.
                    Negotiations were concluded with the French which eliminated dealing with the
                    Moroccans at all, for which procedure we paid later in Moroccan resentment. A
                    consortium of engineering firms under Bechtel was established and started hiring
                    Americans helter-skelter, many characters not to be believed.</p>
                <p>Some were hired in New York, got drunk on the plane, stayed drunk on the plane,
                    arrived in Paris drunk, were transferred to another plane, arrived drunk in
                    Casablanca. Three days later, they were sent back home, drunk. Any able-bodied
                    man who had ever driven a truck or even been close to big equipment was hired.
                    Within a matter of days, the center of Casablanca was turned into a wild west
                    town. Brawls all the time; shootings. It was just a terrible mess.</p>
                <p>Now it happened that we still had extraterritorial rights in Morocco, which meant
                    that any American who was arrested, who was a defendant in a civil or criminal
                    case, was tried by a US consular court using the jurisprudence of the District
                    of Columbia. There was the Consulate General court in Casablanca, and there was
                    the Legation court in Tangier.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Well, it was a lot of fun, but it became a lot of work and John Madden decided to
                    crack down. We had to restore order. And we began to be tough on all of these
                    Americans arrested by the police for disorderly conduct and other acts. We
                    levied increasingly heavy fines for misconduct and sent those found guilty of
                    more serious crimes back to the District to serve time, and, so, with the help
                    of the Consortium, we managed to get the situation under control.</p>
                <p>It was important that we did for it had become a crazy scene. Shootings,
                    fighting, double murders. You name it, we had it, including, but that was not
                    related to the bases, a case of piracy on the high seas. Some Americans had
                    become involved with the Italian mafia. Attacking from high speed boats, they
                    hijacked a ship on the high seas and took off hundreds of cases of cigarettes to
                    peddle in Sicily. Somehow, they were arrested and tried in the Tangier court. It
                    was completely an 18th century happening in the 20th century. But it was
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I was transferred in 1953 to Beirut, Lebanon, after home leave, as an
                    economic officer. Beirut at that time, was indeed the Paris of the East. A
                    delightful place. I was in the section under Armin Meyer. Raymond Hare came as
                    ambassador. Charming man. But I was there only three months before being
                    transferred directly to Tehran.</p>
                <p>I replaced Joe Cunningham there. Missy, his wife, had developed an illness
                    somewhere which the doctors couldn't identify. She kept losing weight; she
                    really was not in very good shape. They thought maybe it had to do with the
                    altitude at Tehran and so they were transferred to Beirut. I was sent to take
                    his place. She was finally sent to a hospital in Germany, specializing in
                    tropical diseases. They found a virus that she had picked up in Burma, and she
                    made a complete recovery. They were a thoroughly professional couple and remain
                    good friends to this day.</p>
                <p>So I took a most interesting trip. Being a bachelor and being in the Middle East
                    where you display your wealth, I had bought a Jaguar in Beirut. I drove it from
                    Beirut to Tehran: from Beirut to Damascus to Amman and then along the
                    International Petroleum Company (IPC) road to Baghdad. And from there, up
                    country, into Iran to Hamadan and Khorramshahr and finally Tehran. Imagine doing
                    that today! While language was a major barrier throughout, nevertheless, I did
                    not sense any animosity- more curiosity, particularly regarding the Jaguar- than
                    animosity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Iran at that time. You were
                        there from 1953 to '56.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Three years exactly. It was a very interesting time in that it was just
                    after the overthrow of Mossadegh and the return of the Shah from exile. It was a
                    time filled with hope for that country. We had very large aid missions- both
                    economic and military- and we were prepared to make a major effort to help the
                    Shah modernize his country. Iran was still largely in the middle ages. There was
                    a big gap between a very thin layer of exceedingly rich people and the great
                    mass of very poor and very ignorant people. Villages thirty kilometers from the
                    capital had not changed in any significant way in the last 3,000 years since
                    their creation. The houses were built of mud and straw, the plows were made of
                    wood, the winnowing was done by throwing the wheat in the air; twelve,
                    thirteen-year old girls wove rugs in very dark rooms filled with dust. There was
                    of course no electricity. The major families still measured their wealth by the
                    number of villages they owned. It was an extraordinary experience. You really
                    stepped far back into history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling in the embassy about the overthrow.
                        Were we uncomfortable about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I got there afterwards with a new group of officers who had also arrived
                    recently. We therefore had rather limited knowledge of the past events. Still
                    there was a consensus that the Tudeh Party (Iranian Communist Party) was the
                    most coherent force in the opposition to the Shah, and would have eventually
                    overwhelmed Mossadegh. There very much was the sense that the Shah represented
                    stability and that his heart was in the right place. We were prepared to help
                    him move the country forward. However, all of us became increasingly concerned
                    by the Shah's inability to deal realistically with his budget and establish true
                    priorities, and with the general lack of responsibility on the part of the
                    ruling class. They apparently felt no obligation towards their society. They
                    were out for themselves and for their families. Corruption was wide-spread.
                    While every society is corrupt up to a point, there it was so rampant, it was
                    damaging. For American observers, it really rubbed the wrong way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing economic work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I was first Special Assistant to the Ambassador, Loy Henderson. He was
                    one of the great diplomats of the post-war. His wife was a problem for everyone
                    including himself. But he was very attached to her. Part of my job was the care
                    and feeding of Mrs. Henderson, which was not easy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could explain, since this is now history.
                        From the view of: what happens when you have an ambassador's wife who is a
                        real problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: As in so many things, you try to support and protect the Ambassador, and
                    try to absorb some of the difficulties created.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what manner? How does one work under these
                        conditions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I think you accept more unpleasantness than you would normally. You try
                    to handle each difficulty as best you can without bothering the Ambassador. Help
                    him keep his peace of mind kind-of-thing. She dealt with the whole staff, both
                    junior and senior officers, in a very insulting fashion. She was very socially
                    inclined, loved the beautiful people. The fact that I was accepted by the
                    beautiful people, (because those were the people with whom the ambassador had to
                    deal - the Shah and his whole family and their entourage) I got off relatively
                    lightly.</p>
                <p>She was a curious person. Not well educated. She liked gossip, dancing, men,
                    parties, fun in the worst Persian sort of way. She was impressed by wealth. She
                    was quite insensitive. But the Ambassador was very attached to her. She was
                    Lithuanian. They were married when he was serving in Moscow in the 1930's,
                    before the war. The story was told that his friends at the Embassy strongly
                    disapproved of this marriage and did not attend the wedding ceremony. It was
                    further said that he never forgave them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about Loy Henderson, one of our great
                        ambassadors.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: He chose Bill Rountree as DCM. He had great confidence in him and
                    Rountree was a very competent, well organized, clear headed person, who ran the
                    Embassy. Loy Henderson operated from a very conservative philosophy, profoundly
                    anti-communist, anti-Soviet, and somewhat suspicious of anyone who was not WASP.
                    He had been very harshly treated by the Jewish lobby in the US, when he was
                    Assistant Secretary for the Middle East, and as a result was very suspicious of
                    Jews and Jewish activities. We had excellent relations with the British Embassy.
                    Iran in the view of the Ambassador, and indeed of virtually all of us, was the
                    key country in the middle east at that time; it was the most significant barrier
                    between the USSR and the Persian Gulf. This, I believe, is still true today.
                    Geopolitically, Iran is one of the most important countries in that area, and
                    indeed in the world.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>He was very, very conservative, with some biases of his generation. He worked
                    very hard to support the Shah and to effect a reconciliation between the
                    Iranians and the British. Henderson had been in Moscow in the '30s. His
                    experience there formed much of his outlook- as indeed it did others who lived
                    there in those bleak years. He was a major player in bringing the British back
                    and arriving at a settlement of the oil problem. That was the most important
                    issue with which he dealt. And he dealt with it with Rountree without anyone
                    else being involved. He held all the negotiations on oil very tightly, so I
                    never really followed the discussions on how the agreement was reached.</p>
                <p>He was a man of great charm, of great dignity. A great presence. The very
                    personification of a diplomat. Straight out of central casting. He didn't speak
                    any other language except English. He didn't speak much Russian, and no French
                    or German. He was very highly regarded. He had considerable political
                    imagination to find solutions to problems and he had a very precise mind. He was
                    truly a diplomat's diplomat and a man who imposed respect. Everyone had taken
                    their measure of Mrs. Henderson but it did not affect his position or
                    reputation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Special assistant to ambassador allows you to see the
                        whole operation. From your viewpoint, how was the embassy run?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Henderson had that rare ability of keeping a broad view of the
                    situation, and at the same time a keen eye on all elements which he considered
                    important. On these he had precise and detailed knowledge. He had an excellent
                    memory. Perhaps from his days in Moscow, he had a very strong sense of security.
                    On the most important issues- oil negotiations, relations with the Shah- he
                    operated very close to his chest. I believe he shared these questions with
                    Rountree who had his full confidence and ran the Embassy, but with Rountree
                    alone. For instance, all the files on the oil negotiations were kept in
                    Rountree's office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the corruption?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: We had other issues to worry about. There is very little one country can
                    do about corruption in another society. I think one of the great myths that has
                    been allowed to flower in this country is the degree to which we have control
                    over other countries. Americans hold themselves responsible for everything bad
                    that happens in the world. Yet one conclusion I have carried away after 30 years
                    in the foreign service is how remarkably little direct influence we have in fact
                    on the functioning of another society. They have their own values and their own
                    ways of working. You just don't change these. Particularly by moralizing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We weren't moralizing then, were we?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The AID people were those who had to deal with the problem and were
                    always fighting and trying to get the leadership to recognize how much it
                    hampered programs. But it was a very difficult matter. You had the Shah's sister
                    and his brothers who were involved. Later after I left, I was told you couldn't
                    build a factory without paying off Abdor Reza, the Shah's brother.</p>
                <p>

                        this happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I was in the foreign service to be active. It was a French speaking
                    area, and it was going through a difficult period. I was single and that was a
                    factor. I was sent as deputy chief of the political section, which was a very
                    nice promotion. This was in 1957.</p>
                <p>I was acting chief for several months because the previous chief had left. Tom
                    Bowie, the new political Counselor, came in three or four months later. It was
                    fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Durbrow. Durbrow came in after Reinhardt and Daniel Anderson was the
                    DCM. As a Foreign Service tit-bit, the administrative counselor asked me to stay
                    in the residence to keep an eye on things in the interim between the two
                    ambassadors. I jumped at the chance and there gave some of the best parties ever
                    in my whole career. It was elegant living!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation as you saw it in 1957?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I think all of us felt it very difficult to penetrate the Vietnamese
                    situation. I attended a number of so called political meetings and there were a
                    lot of formalized speeches in Vietnamese. Not knowing Vietnamese it was
                    difficult really to get a grasp of the reality of political life. Diem and his
                    family were very close knit, and completely ran the show, which was in the
                    tradition of the country. Flowering democracies are not many in this world.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>There was no political party that was impressive as such or that you could
                    determine its true configuration. The country had completed what I call the
                    French chapter in 1954 with the signing of the Geneva Agreement and the
                    departure of the French administration. Many of us were disquieted by the
                    tensions that existed between French and Americans and it just happened that
                    there was a group of recently arrived young American officers who spoke French
                    well, and were trying to bridge the gap between the French and ourselves. Some
                    Americans were coming over and saying, “well, now that we're here, we are going
                    to save the situation, and the French don't know how to do anything. They fought
                    the war poorly but now we're going to be here and teach the Vietnamese how to
                    fight.”These were American military officers mostly. Particularly, the more
                    senior officers. The captains and lieutenants who had been out in the field, had
                    a much better appreciation of what was involved than the colonels and
                    generals.</p>
                <p>The lieutenant general in charge of the MAG at that time was called Hanging Sam
                    Williams, because he had been responsible at Nuremberg for overseeing the
                    execution of the prisoners condemned to death.</p>
                <p>The junior officers had a better sense of the nature of the insecurity, than the
                    senior military coming out of World War II. The latter tended to be disparaging
                    of the French; the junior officers, both military and civilian, felt that this
                    was not a terribly intelligent attitude, because the French had a good
                    understanding of the country and still held very important positions. To start
                    with, the Vietnamese leadership spoke French more than English and still felt
                    surprisingly warmly towards France. There were French schools and French
                    businesses were still a major factor. So most of us thought it was better
                    working with them rather than against them.</p>
                <p>1957 was a year of restoring relations between the French and American embassies.
                    We managed quite well but with the military it remained difficult. These were
                    also some of the rare years of peace between 1954 and 1960, when the war heated
                    up again. In 1957, you could actually drive a car from Saigon all the way to the
                    highlands. There was a remarkable sense of security and it was a beautiful
                    country. The people are hard working and interesting. Very pleasant and
                    interesting posting.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel optimistic about how things were going to
                        go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I think we were optimistic because we were putting in a lot of money, a
                    lot of effort and a lot of good people, and felt that Vietnam could be built up
                    into a viable country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Having come from Iran where you were seeing this
                        corruption, did you feel this was being duplicated.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Again, it is so hard for a foreigner to measure such things. There was a
                    feeling that Diem was absolutely honest, but that feeling didn't extend to his
                    family. That was one of the strong factors that led us to support him. He was a
                    stabilizing influence. He was clean. He was patriotic. He represented a
                    tradition, even though he was a Catholic, and he represented a moral force. But
                    even in '57, we were debating among ourselves how much support Diem had among
                    his people. Our impression was that Diem was very rigid and that he was
                    alienating a lot of his countrymen. The country had been very heavily worked
                    over by the communists, who were still gaining positions in the countryside. So
                    while we respected Diem, we had a very uncomfortable feeling that he was not
                    establishing the sort of authority that would pull the country together. To this
                    day, I find it very difficult to make a judgement of how in fact he was viewed
                    by the Vietnamese themselves because after his murder, there was a series of
                    coups but there was no one who was really able to establish his authority. In
                    countries like Vietnam which have always experienced authoritarian regimes, it
                    is crucial to have a respected central authority, and to be able to work with
                    it.</p>
                <p>So it was a time of hope. Diem represented a leader of eminent qualities:
                    honesty, patriotism, seriousness. In many ways he represented the kind of leader
                    whom we have looked for in many developing countries, but we remained nagged by
                    doubts regarding his ability to cope in a confrontation with a major communist
                    challenge.</p>
                <p>SIDE TWO</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you were only there ten months. Then where did you
                        go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I was transferred directly to Vientiane in Laos as chief of the two-man
                    political section. I found it a very interesting, but puzzling, situation, with
                    an ambassador I respected very much, James Parsons, and his wife, Peggy, a
                    charming Canadian, and a Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma for whom I
                    developed considerable respect. Unfortunately, there was a personal antagonism
                    between the two men. And they reflected two fundamentally different views on how
                    to save Laos. Jeff Parsons very much espoused the view of Washington that given
                    a Communist China and the then apparently firm Sino-Soviet Bloc, it was
                    essential for us to draw the line in Southeast Asia. There could be no
                    compromise with the communists. Souvanna Phouma dealt with the Lao reality,
                    which favors compromise. His half-brother, Prince Souphanouvong was a leader of
                    the Pathet Lao, which was the Lao communist party and held two provinces in the
                    Northeast, resulting from the 1954 Geneva Agreement. Souvanna felt that the way
                    to maintain peace and the integrity of Laos was to work it out with the Pathet
                    Lao, among Lao of all tendencies. For the Americans, this was unthinkable. At
                    the time, Americans perceived the communist threat as world-wide, determined and
                    coordinated. We put little trust in men of good will such as Souvanna being able
                    to hold out against the communists. It was a fear of the camel's nose under the
                    tent.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>The tension between the two men existed right through this time. There very
                    unfortunately developed an active dislike between them. It was a clash of policy
                    but it became personal. Jeff went back to become Assistant Secretary for the Far
                    East and this tension remained a problem.</p>
                <p>When I came back later to Washington to become desk officer, the junior officers
                    felt much more in sympathy with Souvanna than Jeff and the senior officers
                    throughout the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you able to report, to operate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: When I arrived, the other political officer was John Gunther Dean, whom
                    I did not know but who already had the reputation of being a very able young
                    officer, and who had established a personal relationship with Souvanna. John's
                    wife, Martine, is French and a very intelligent and able person. They worked
                    very well together.</p>
                <p>There was the same problem in Laos that there had been in Vietnam: of Americans
                    coming in and trying to push the French out. All of us at the Embassy understood
                    that it was much better to work with the French community, and we made great
                    efforts that way, including with Souvanna Phouma, who remained close to the
                    French.</p>
                <p>When I arrived, rather than take over all these contacts that were senior to
                    John, I told him, “You carry on with Souvanna and the others, and when you
                    leave, I shall take over all your contacts. We are only two men in this section.
                    It's no big deal.” That's the way we operated.</p>
                <p>In any event, in a village like Vientiane, you get to know everybody pretty
                    quickly. It was a dusty village of less than 100,000 people, and marvelously
                    cheerful. The Lao are very welcoming and relaxed. Unpretentious.
                    Non-competitive. Friendly, warm people. For any occasion, there would be a boon,
                    which is a Buddhist feast celebrated on all important - and not so
                    important-occasions, marriage, birth, holiday and departure, etc. And they
                    included foreigners. The Lao have no side to them. They remain an
                    extraordinarily attractive people. They are not very vigorous, and they don't
                    work too hard. But it is a very attractive, small society. They're very humble
                    and say, “Oh, we're just 3 million people in the middle of Southeast Asia and
                    there's only so much we can do. “ They recognized that the Vietnamese were the
                    power in the area and that they were caught between Vietnam and Thailand.</p>
                <p>So it was very easy to get to know the full leadership, all of the ministers, all
                    the senior generals. In parenthesis, to show the stability of that society, I
                    left in 1959 and when I came back in 1974, Ambassador Whitehouse gave a dinner
                    in my honor with all the senior generals. They were exactly the same gang I had
                    known 16 years earlier! The same was true for the political leadership. I could
                    not believe it. It is a small society with stable ruling families.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Laos didn't get the attention that flared up later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: More papers, hours, energy, money must have been spent by more people in
                    the USG on Laos per square mile, per head of population than on any other
                    country. When I came back to Washington in 1959 as desk officer for Laos, the
                    country was in continuing crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel the crisis there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes, but it was in no small measure generated by Americans. The least
                    thing caused us to get terribly excited.</p>
                <p>In 1975, on April 15, Phnom Penh fell, and Saigon fell to the communists on April
                    31. On May 1, one day later there were demonstrations in Vientiane. Within a
                    month the Pathet Lao had taken over. I think the case can be made that it was
                    the activism, firmness, deep involvement, however you might want to call it, of
                    the United States in these countries that kept the communists at bay, at least
                    until 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the tools at hand for trying to do this. You had
                        an ambassador who couldn't talk to the leader very well. What were the other
                        tools?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: In 1958-59 when I was first there, we had a large aid mission and what
                    was called the Program Evaluation Office, which was responsible for keeping tabs
                    on the military assistance we were providing. It is a measure of the
                    artificiality of the situation that the PEO was manned by US military officers
                    who had been civilianized. They were not in uniform but all wore white shorts
                    and white short sleeve shirts. Everyone knew who they were in reality and called
                    its leader, John Heintges, “General”, even though he always scrupulously
                    introduced himself as “Mr.” We had gone to extraordinary lengths to maintain the
                    fiction of the country's neutrality.</p>
                <p>The economy, such as it was, such as it had developed, was totally dependent upon
                    foreign assistance, particularly the US and France. In terms of Laos, it was
                    very large. And one of the problems that we never resolved though we recognized
                    its negative impact was that of the counter-part funds. Because we were
                    providing a lot of military assistance, and economic aid, and generating kips,
                    which was the local currency, it was necessary to find a mechanism to absorb
                    these kips so as to avoid causing a wild inflation. And to do that we helped
                    them import consumer goods to sop up these kips..</p>
                <p>Goods could be imported with a license. Any Lao who had a license, had money in
                    the bank, because licenses could be sold and that led to widespread corruption.
                    A lot of people became very rich through the system. This was something that we
                    never resolved.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the field there, how did you view the Pathet Lao at
                        that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I think we viewed the Pathet Lao more seriously than they were in fact.
                    They were hidden, living away to the Northeast in the hills bordering on
                    Vietnam. The danger was the Vietnamese. The Secretary General of the Pathet Lao
                    was half-Vietnamese and Prince Souphanouvong, who was one of the principal
                    leaders of the Pathet Lao, had a wife who was Vietnamese, a dedicated communist
                    and a very strong influence on him. That was the danger, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The whole thing had a racial overtone, didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The Lao were the valley dwellers. Then you had the Hmong, the mountain
                    tribes in the northeast. The reason they became involved in the so-called secret
                    war, was that they were situated between the Lao in the Mekong Delta Valley and
                    the Pathet Lao and the Vietnamese in the northwest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Vietnamese being perceived as a threat, that they
                        were trying to take over Laos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The Lao always felt threatened by the Vietnamese and by the Thais. Both
                    are historical enemies. The former now had in addition an expansive political
                    system and ideology. The Lao genuinely feared them. There was a feeling among
                    the Lao that if the French had not taken over the country in the last century,
                    there would have been no Laos today. The Cambodians had very much the same
                    feeling. The Thais and the Vietnamese would have taken over these countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel towards the Thais?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: We treated them as respected allies. And important. We tried very
                    strongly to encourage them to be generous and supportive of the Lao. By and
                    large I think we did help mediate between the Thais and the Lao.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in many ways, our efforts and the French efforts helped
                        gel these borders.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: That's right. Historically, the Vietnamese push into Cambodia a few
                    years ago is in line with the history of the Vietnamese. They originally came
                    from China 1200 years ago.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I don't know the etymology.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Their word for South actually means south China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: They came down from China along the south China Sea, a strip of land
                    between the Annamite chain and the sea and then gnawed their way over a thousand
                    years right down into the south, eliminating all the peoples who had lived
                    there, establishing soldier-farmer villages and gradually working their way
                    forward. The thrust into Cambodia a few years ago was in line with the general
                    thrust of their entire history. The withdrawal from Cambodia last year is
                    historically the first time they pulled back. Q: The question is whether they
                    have really pulled back.</p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: So there was this sense that you had a dynamic, energetic, determined
                    people, the Vietnamese, who were kept within their boundaries by the French and
                    then by us. Any chance they would have, they would press west against the Lao
                    and the Cambodians, and eventually the Thais.</p>

                        threat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Communist threat. What is now forgotten about this situation is that at
                    that time, there was a Sino-Soviet bloc that was truly threatening. It was
                    threatening by its size, by its ideology, by its determination, by its global
                    weight. Supporting communist rebellions in all three Indochina states, in
                    Thailand, in Malaysia and in the Philippines. There was a great deal of
                    uncertainty as to where the whole area would be going. All these countries were
                    still very vulnerable and weak throughout the 40's, 50's, 60's and even
                    70's.</p>

                <p>CHAPMAN: I believe it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe it too. People forget these things. You were
                        operating under this impression, that there was a communist threat and you
                        had to toe the line.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I believed absolutely in Washington's overall view. On the ground,
                    however, the junior officers saw the reality and felt a little uneasy as to the
                    amount of resources we were devoting to these countries. They were such weak
                    societies and we were pouring in these millions and corrupting them in very
                    large measure. But to hold the line is not easy when you deal with societies
                    that are vulnerable in so many ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it possible to talk to the Pathet Lao?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: No, they were up in the northeast in the other province, and there was
                    no contact. To the best of my knowledge, not even the CIA had any direct
                    contact. However, there was one moment in 1958 after Souvanna returned to power
                    when his half brother Prince Souphanouvong and his wife came to Vientiane to
                    test the waters. The new American Ambassador, Horace Smith, even had them to a
                    swim lunch at his pool. The conversation was very guarded and neutral. Finally,
                    tensions in the city developed which forced the Pathet Lao Prince to leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the kind of area that became CIA country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the CIA operate and interface with the rest of the
                        policy. Were they a loose cannon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I was in Laos twice. Once in '57-59 and again in 1974-75. Theirs was a
                    large presence. Already in 1958-59 their operation was larger than the Foreign
                    Service. And they were in touch with all of the players. By 1974-75, they had
                    wired the whole place. As a Foreign Service officer, you looked at an event and
                    weren't quite sure whether it was generated by the society or somehow generated
                    by the agency. They had half of the ministers on their payrolls- or so it
                    seemed. It was, I think, a very unhealthy situation.</p>
                <p>I felt then and I feel today that we work in but one embassy and therefore must
                    work cooperatively with the CIA. I had good relations with the agency people.
                    They probably considered me a bit naive and didn't tell me what I didn't need to
                    know, and in truth I did not seek it out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in 1959. Was it stabilized?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes it was stabilized. After untold happenings, a new government under
                    Phoui Sananikone, the leader of the major family from Vientiane, was
                    established, courtesy, I suspect in part, of the CIA. Souvanna was ousted. Phoui
                    was a genial, roly-poly, easy going man, but shrewd and intelligent. It was a
                    government that had essentially accepted our point of view- i.e., the communists
                    were a threat and to be opposed without compromise. The government was genuinely
                    friendly and eager to work with us. We were comfortable together. We felt that
                    after years of spending time and energy making tactical moves, finally we had a
                    situation that would permit the Lao, with our active support, to build their
                    country. Here I think some credit is due the new Ambassador who replaced Jeff
                    Parsons, Horace Smith. He was a big man who exuded energy and optimism, and who
                    by his very cheerfulness and gung-ho attitude reassured the Lao, and certainly
                    his relations with Phoui were excellent.</p>
                <p>And so I left feeling good. And then I came back and ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have you at the Laotian desk between 1959 and 1962.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes. In June 1960, we sent out a new ambassador, Winthrop Brown, a
                    marvelous man. Very steady and open-minded. Within two weeks of his arrival,
                    there was a coup in Vientiane led by a young captain, Kong Le, against the
                    government. He declared: “I am for Laos, and the Lao people, for honesty, purity
                    and against corruption,” and he completely upset the apple cart. He asked
                    Souvanna to take back the prime ministership. Phoui and his Ministers were out
                    of the capital when the coup happened. It was a time of extreme tension. No one
                    knew exactly which way things would go and there was always the fear that the
                    Pathet Lao would take advantage of the situation and come in. Vientiane became
                    isolated and Souvanna Phouma became Prime Minister again. Fortunately, Win Brown
                    remained calm and managed to establish a good relationship with him. Win being
                    very level headed, argued that we should work with Souvanna, because he
                    represented the Lao reality.</p>
                <p>Well, you have never seen a town so emotional as Washington. The Pentagon
                    considered Win Brown virtually a traitor, gone-soft kind of thing. The senior
                    levels of the State Department gave him very little support, although his old
                    friend, Jeff Parsons, stuck by him. But the working folks in the Department and
                    even in Defense, thought he was right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did this happen? Laos is not a place people know much
                        about.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Laos was the front line. It extended from Korea, through Indochina, to
                    Iran, Turkey and NATO. Indochina is where the issue was now joined. This was the
                    weak link and it was perceived that way and believe me, at that time, there was
                    a lot of emotion. There was a lot of fear regarding the drift of events. We had
                    demobilized after World War II and then there was the Korean War, and now we
                    were involved in this very messy situation in Indochina with an aggressive
                    Soviet Union and China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're still talking about the latter days of the
                        Eisenhower Administration. What did you do as a desk officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Well, I worked very closely with Jeff Parsons, whom I very much admired
                    and liked even though I thought better of Souvanna than he did. But there was an
                    emotional factor there. Bill Sullivan was assistant to Jeff and because the Laos
                    desk was the most agitated right then in Southeast Asia, I had direct access.
                    Daniel Anderson, the Director of the office and Dick Usher, his deputy, worked a
                    good deal on Laos affairs but left me considerable freedom. In fact, most of the
                    officers in the Office of Southeast Asia worked in one way or another on the
                    problems generated by Laos. It was quite a boiler room that office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: It's difficult to convey years later but it was a very charged
                    atmosphere. When a country is in crisis, formidable pressures and demands gather
                    on the desk: continuing requests for briefings and speeches from the top levels
                    of the administration; continuing inquiries from Congress; unending questions
                    from the media; inquiries from many Embassies; requests for speeches, for
                    discussion panels, etc. All this on top of a flood of materials coming from all
                    over the world. These were twelve hour days, seven day weeks.</p>
                <p>As an indicator of the priority Laos had assumed by the end of 1960, one of the
                    first trips Kennedy took in January of 1961, was to meet Prime Minister of Great
                    Britain MacMillan in Key West in Florida. There were a couple of issues but the
                    first big issue was Laos. (Skybolt was the other.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before Kennedy came in, did you get this pessimistic
                        impression of Laos from the Pentagon? Where was it coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: It was coming from the general atmosphere. We were so deeply involved
                    with our military and AID missions that every happening in Southeast Asia echoed
                    in Washington. You felt you had to react to every word Souvanna said. A climate
                    develops in Washington that requires you to act at every step, otherwise, you
                    are preempted by other players, and the more serious the crisis, the more
                    players you have- which provides another element of tension. (Just as an
                    example. In order to maintain the leadership of the Department in the conduct of
                    affairs on Laos, I gathered every once in a while all the officers who dealt
                    with it on a daily, operational basis. We were some thirty, and I am not talking
                    of the dozen of others, inferiors and superiors who numbered in the hundreds,
                    but just the immediate operational guys.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an example of how things get completely
                        overplayed. I suppose those who had been there could say that this was no
                        big deal but obviously nobody is going to listen to a relatively junior
                        officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: That's exactly right. Anybody who had said at that time, “Well, maybe we
                    should talk to the communists” would have been crucified within the executive
                    branch, in the legislative branch, and in the press. There was a degree of
                    unanimity in this country that created a lot of pressure, and made it virtually
                    impossible to propose alternatives.Now everybody says that Vietnam was a
                    mistake, but at that time we marched down that road as a single man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there others that thought like you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I think the junior officers felt on this specific issue of Laos that
                    Souvanna was probably right and that we should help him find a Lao solution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that would be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Compromise with the Pathet Lao. But this coup was important. The one by
                    Captain Kong Le in June of 1960. He ousted the Sananikone government which he
                    considered corrupt and asked Souvanna to become Prime Minister. So this made
                    everybody uncomfortable - a young captain revolting and choosing Souvanna.
                    Souvanna was again talking peace among the Lao, bringing all the factions
                    together. Win Brown said that he was right and that he was the only one who
                    could put the show together again. And in Washington, people were saying Win
                    Brown is a traitor and Souvanna is dangerous, he wants to compromise with
                    Communists. He is going to lead us down the road and the Pathet Lao are going to
                    take over. Emotions ran very high here.</p>

                <p>One of the great regrets I have in my career was that unbeknownst to me, and I
                    was then the Laos desk officer, a high-level DOD mission was sent to northeast
                    Thailand. They went there to see Colonel Phoumi Nosavan who was in south Laos in
                    dissidence against Souvanna Phouma. They promised Phoumi gold and US
                    support.</p>

                <p>CHAPMAN: Contrary to everything we had told Souvanna. To this day I believe it
                    was one of the more shameful acts of this government.</p>

                <p>CHAPMAN: He was a very disciplined officer and he and Jeff Parsons were very
                    close friends. It was a very painful moment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: What happened was that there was a great deal of uncertainty for some
                    months. Finally Kennedy came in and Harriman was made Assistant Secretary for
                    the Far East. Harriman met Souvanna in India and took a good measure of the man
                    and helped bring him back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about Kennedy. One of the first sights I had of
                        him was sitting with a map of Laos on television explaining where this
                        country of three million people was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: This was the front line between the Free World and the communist world.
                    There was instability in the country and therefore the fear that the Pathet Lao
                    would take advantage of the situation, and break the front.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were an experienced desk officer. Were you able to get
                        across to the Kennedy administration how you felt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: It was done beyond me. I don't know how the Kennedy Administration was
                    briefed on Laos, frankly. I know I wrote some long papers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kennedy became renowned later for talking with desk
                        officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Not this one, but he did take me to Key West. With MacMillan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Averell Harriman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Harriman was the one who turned this around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much to do with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Not very much because I left the desk not too many weeks after he took
                    over and I was on the Vietnam Task Force that was being organized at that time.
                    I had gotten married in April 1960, and working twelve hour days was not ideal
                    under the circumstance. So I left the desk in 1961 and joined the Vietnam Task
                    Force.There was a growing problem there; the north Vietnamese had launched an
                    offensive against the south the previous winter and the situation was
                    deteriorating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe your trip to Key West with Kennedy. What
                        did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I was a note taker. I had a hard time hearing MacMillan who spoke
                    through his heavy mustache and dropped his words on the table. Essentially there
                    was an agreement to work towards the reconciliation of the anti-communist Lao
                    factions, and support Souvanna as leader. The Europeans were always more
                    favorably disposed towards Souvanna.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The British have never been much of a player there, so why
                        the meeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: They weren't. But the British have always known how to work this town,
                    how to work with Americans. In embassies abroad they have always been close to
                    the American embassies because they speak the same language, they understand the
                    American perspective and they add their own intelligent views to our own. They
                    are very professional and for us Americans, friends like that are always very
                    useful. It extends the range of our reporting and the knowledge of a society,
                    and they are very professional colleagues. Canadians are very good also. But
                    world wide, the British are certainly the best diplomats that I have dealt
                    with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about this task force? What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I was one of a growing number of officers on the Vietnam Task Force
                    because there was a growing problem in that country. This was the winter of
                    1961. Hanoi had reopened the war in the south. There was a growing number of
                    incidents. So we got more involved in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1961-62. How did the officers feel
                        about Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: There was no real dissent, no real dissent. This is the great tragedy of
                    Vietnam, that at no point did anyone suggest alternative policies nor could we
                    easily disengage ourselves from Vietnam. I don't know when we could have
                    disengaged without shaking our alliances throughout the world. When a situation
                    becomes worse and the United States pulls back, this seeming backing-off a
                    commitment causes great anxiety for Koreans, Europeans, Iranians. I think all of
                    us recognized that. We tend to the overkill, and we made an enormous effort in
                    Vietnam, committed enormous resources, and rather than take a more distant view
                    and build up the Vietnamese forces and say, “We'll do the best we can. We'll
                    deliver the guns and the money, but if you can't hack it, that's it; we have
                    done our best.”I tried one initiative which to this day I think had some merits.
                    To launch a proposal to neutralize Laos and Cambodia (I didn't dare say South
                    Vietnam) under international supervision with rather large international forces
                    in those two countries. With the thought of creating a neutral barrier between
                    Communist China and Vietnam on one side, and Thailand and the Free World on the
                    other. I should have persevered more and pushed it to a higher level. But it got
                    shot down right away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was neutral still a bad word?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes, yes it was. Dulles had said it. To be neutral in the world is to be
                    immoral. It was the one initiative that I took that to this day I think had some
                    merits. I don't think it had a chance in hell. If it had been accepted in the
                    State Department, it would have been killed by the Pentagon, the Congress and
                    the press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1964 you went to Luxembourg.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: From 1962-1963, I was in charge of the Far East Branch of Personnel,
                    responsible for assigning both clerical staff and officers to the area. It
                    turned out to be a wonderful assignment. It gave me a better understanding of
                    the workings of the Department than any other I have had. And it left me with a
                    very good feeling about the assignment process. All the branch chiefs met once a
                    week and decided on all individual assignments world-wide. It was efficient
                    because the process was clear and it was fair, because much time was devoted to
                    individual cases, contrary to the impression that has unfortunately developed in
                    the Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>From 1963 to 1964, I went to the National War College, a very good experience. I
                    chose Luxembourg for my next assignment because that was the seat of The High
                    Authority of The Coal and Steel Community, the first in the construction of
                    Europe. I still consider that the European Community was the one creative idea
                    that came out of World War II. It has changed history. I had read up on it and
                    was interested to take a closer look at it.</p>
                <p>In terms of career, it was not a very intelligent move because by the time I
                    reached Luxembourg the High Authority was in its dying days. It had fulfilled
                    its basic functions and its only future was to be integrated into the larger
                    framework of the European Economic Community in Brussels. So I didn't get much
                    scope for activity and I was glad to be transferred a year and a half later to
                    the international staff of NATO. By then, Ambassador Jack Tuthill and everyone
                    else recognized that there was not much going on in Luxembourg. The Europeans
                    had decided to fuse the High Authority into the European Community. The
                    outstanding questions before the organization were largely administrative-
                    questions of personnel, assignments and division of jobs among the different
                    nationalities, the allocation of the various elements of the Authority between
                    Luxembourg and Brussels. The fusion took three years to be resolved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in the international side of NATO. I have you there
                        from 1966 to 68. Could you explain what you did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I had the longest title of my career. I was Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    General for Political Affairs and Information. The Assistant Secretary was
                    German, Joachim Jaenike, who served just below the Secretary General. The
                    Directorate had about a dozen officers at the Counselor level from various
                    nationalities.</p>
                <p>On the political affairs side, we chaired the many political committees, the
                    committee system being the heart of the workings of NATO. This is where the
                    fifteen member countries could on a regular basis compare notes on what was
                    going on in the world and what each country was doing. The political aspect of
                    NATO has never been sufficiently appreciated. It provided , and provides today
                    at a time of extraordinary change, a mechanism for the allies to remain
                    currently informed and moving in the same direction. It remains a very important
                    function- one that historically has never been so successfully tried over so
                    many years.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>We were also responsible for a very large information effort with about a hundred
                    people. Interestingly enough, while all fifteen governments in NATO actively
                    supported NATO, politically they felt very vulnerable at home with their public
                    opinion. The heart of the matter was that all governments were under great
                    domestic pressure to do more on the social side of their societies. Defense
                    appeared to public opinion, even in the US, to take resources away from other
                    purposes. All the governments therefore considered that this information effort
                    was essential. So we had a big program. Busloads of people came to NATO every
                    week and we gave them lectures and pamphlets and booklets, all sorts of
                    literature and distributed widely information materials of all sorts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who did you consider to be target groups? What countries
                        or types of people were you aiming at?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Probably it was mostly the academic world. Students and teachers, grade
                    schools to universities. But many other groups came through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The same kind of effort that has been made with the United
                        Nations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: That's exactly right.</p>
                <p>In 1967 De Gaulle threw out the military from France and the Council decided to
                    move the entire organization to Brussels. I felt then and I feel now that had
                    NATO been as fragile as it was perceived by governments, it would have broken up
                    at that time. In fact the move from Paris to Brussels was remarkably well done.
                    We closed our offices on a Friday in Paris and reopened on the following Monday
                    in Brussels. Without missing a committee meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling among the staff towards the
                        French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: A lot of bitterness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about with the French among you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Our French colleagues were very embarrassed and of course we avoided
                    making an issue of it with them. They were very unhappy and we had a lot of
                    sympathy for them because it was a very difficult moment. They thought of NATO
                    the way we did, as essential. De Gaulle was playing a political game. In fact
                    while the French military was out of the command structure, they nevertheless
                    retained a very close liaison. To this day it is so close that it is ludicrous
                    for France to remain outside the military structure.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there wasn't any real break then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: There was a real moment of uncertainty when it could have broken up. And
                    if one country had sad, “Well yes we too want to take our distances from the
                    organization,” I think it could have started the unraveling of NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling that other countries' leaders
                        were thinking about this at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The revelation was that despite the governments' anxieties regarding
                    public opinion, they all stuck together very firmly. This was the best evidence
                    that NATO mattered to Western Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think de Gaulle was surprised at this or had he
                        counted on it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I think he counted on it. He would not have made his decision if it
                    would have broken the alliance apart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would have left France isolated with Germany right
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: With Germany and Russia. De Gaulle was very realistic about the Soviet
                    Union. In fact, allowing his military to work very closely with the allies was
                    pretty good evidence and France remained in the Alliance Council. So it was a
                    charade for domestic purposes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about Greece and Turkey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: All of us felt that NATO provided a forum where countries like Greece
                    and Turkey which could not talk to each other directly might find a way of
                    talking with each other privately. In fact over the years, this is what
                    happened. The Greek and Turkish Ambassadors maintained civil relations and were
                    able to meet quietly whenever that was necessary.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>You asked about the Greeks and Turks. In the political section, of which I was
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary General, we had about twelve officers at the consular
                    level, and there was one Greek and one Turk. In that context we all worked
                    amicably and cooperatively. The Secretary-General also headed a Greek/Turkish
                    Task Force to bring together quietly in the confines of NATO, the Greeks and
                    Turks to resolve their mutual issues, and to provide a mechanism to coordinate
                    allied aid to Turkey and Greece. To this day, I believe that NATO has fulfilled
                    an important function in mediating the emotional relationship between these two
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Please talk about your experience at the time, from 1966

                        NATO and there has been the break up of eastern Europe, now being a much

                <p>CHAPMAN: It was both. It was created to organize a common defense against the
                    perceived Soviet threat. But it was governed by a political Council from the
                    fourteen member countries. Under the Council there was a variety of committees
                    that enabled the member countries to exchange information on developments
                    throughout the world. For instance, there was an annual meeting of experts on
                    the Middle East, on Africa, Latin America and the Far East. So there was a
                    continuing effort to exchange information and to coordinate policies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time did you see a difference between it and the
                        move towards the Common Market?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: NATO was responsible for maintaining a common defense towards the Soviet
                    Union and Eastern Europe and exchanging information relevant to this
                    responsibility. The Common Market was an effort of nine and then twelve European
                    countries to develop a market without barriers to trade and exchanges, a common
                    economic base on which to build political unity. The work of NATO and of the
                    Community went forward in parallel, and in a deep sense, the two efforts were
                    complimentary: one providing a secure environment within which the other could
                    build a new community. From the beginning of its creation, the US encouraged the
                    European unification movement.</p>
                <p>We perceive to this day that Western European unity would contain the differences
                    and tensions among the European states that had led to two world wars in this
                    century, and, would offer a real counter weight to Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How serious did you regard the Soviet Union as a military
                        threat.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: There was unanimity that the Soviet Union was threatening and if the
                    West lowered its guard, that the Soviets would push. Such a push need not be an
                    all out military aggression. The Soviets could have squeezed Berlin which was
                    well within Eastern Germany. If Berlin had been squeezed to the point of being
                    neutralized, most of us were convinced that West Germany would seek an
                    accommodation with Moscow. That would have broken up the Western Alliance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was there about Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: For the Germans Berlin was a highly emotional and real symbol. Bonn
                    made, over the years, enormous efforts to maintain the vitality and viability of
                    Western Berlin.</p>
                <p>The German government organized trips for foreign diplomats to visit Berlin for
                    two or three days at a time, just to show their allies the reality of the city.
                    We would be received by the Mayor of West Berlin and lectured, and allowed to
                    visit the city freely. The West Germans made a very large effort to maintain the
                    economy of West Berlin in order to anchor the young people there. There was the
                    fear that the young people would leave and drain West Berlin of its vitality.
                    This effort was very successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there unanimity that if the Soviets continued to
                        squeeze, that we would respond up to and including all out war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: There was unanimity that we would resist any Soviet effort against
                    Berlin. In 1947 the Soviets tried to block and isolate West Berlin which was
                    only saved through an enormous airlift effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in the '60s did you perceive that we were ready to use
                        force to get to Berlin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: In 1961, when Khrushchev began to threaten, Kennedy sent a regiment to
                    West Berlin and called up some reserves. He very clearly showed that we were
                    prepared to make an important military effort to counter any attack on
                    Berlin.</p>

                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: We had expert groups that would compare notes on all areas of the globe,
                    but NATO did not discuss political matters outside the treaty areas. It was
                    always a point of contention. We sought to broaden the range of discussion NATO
                    held, NATO at the council level, but this view was resisted particularly by the
                    French. There also was not much enthusiasm among the others to get NATO involved
                    with the Middle East, for instance, Vietnam or Latin America.</p>
                <p>I think what dominated the European reaction to Vietnam was a fear that we were
                    getting, this was 1968, we were getting absorbed by Vietnam. There was the fear
                    that this might be at the expense of NATO and our interest and support of NATO.
                    In fact, some US troops were taken out of NATO and sent to Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any reaction, maybe not official
                        reaction, in the corridors or elsewhere? Was there disquiet about our
                        involvement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Oh yes, clearly. There was a clear sense that we were bogged down in
                    Vietnam at the expense of our effort in Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you rate the country's commitment to NATO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I think among the governments there was a unanimous feeling in
                    considering NATO an essential organization for the maintenance of peace in
                    Europe, to protect Western Europe. The best evidence was when de Gaulle threw
                    the NATO military out of France, that the council transferred its offices from
                    Paris to Brussels over one weekend and continued to operate right long. If there
                    had been any doubts about NATO, any country that did not value the organization,
                    that was the moment they could have broken free. The French left the military
                    but in fact remained very active in the council and kept very close liaison with
                    the military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Canadians? What role did they play?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: One remarkable aspect of NATO was the quality of the representatives the
                    countries sent there. They were a very high class of people. The ambassadors had
                    very well developed personalities, some of them with real political power at
                    home. Harlan Cleveland was our Ambassador and a very remarkable one. He had
                    enormous energy: the American mission which was by far the largest regularly
                    worked later than any other and generated much of the drive of the organization,
                    drive and ideas. Cleveland in particular had a very creative mind. Phil Farley,
                    the DCM, was also an officer of considerable talents and political
                    imagination.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1968 and came back to the Department.
                        What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: In 1968 I came back to the Office of Political and Military Affairs that
                    was transformed into a Bureau within two or three months of my arrival. I was
                    asked to create a new office in that bureau, the Office of Military Assistance
                    and Arms Sales. Up until then, the State Department had a Special Assistant to
                    the Under Secretary of Political Affairs to oversee military assistance and arms
                    sales and indeed military strategy generally. There was an imbalance between
                    State and Defense, with State having a very weak organization to deal with a
                    vast range of subjects while Defense had an entire division ISA (International
                    SecurityAdministration).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was their little State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Which was their little State Department and they had desk officers for
                    every country and region. It was a very strong organization with very competent
                    people both military and civilian. A few FSOs also served there but the military
                    were very good people. The State Department had no organization to interface
                    with ISA.So eventually, this imbalance was corrected by the creation of the
                    Bureau of Political and Military Affairs in 1969. Phil Farley was its first
                    Director. He asked me to organize this new office to provide a political
                    framework around these arms transfer programs. These were world-wide programs at
                    a time when the sales were running about $4 billion and grant assistance at
                    nearly $800 million. These were not small matters.</p>
                <p>I spent five years in that job and I like to think organized the office,
                    developed the policies, established it in the bureaucracy, and insured that it
                    functioned effectively. Bureaucratic momentum took over, and the office divided
                    into two offices- one for planning and one for implementation. I had five
                    officers in the beginning, and at the end, after five years, between the two
                    offices, there were about twenty-five.It was a very interesting perspective to
                    see how important the military supply relationship was with many countries. I
                    was amazed how, on the occasion of visits by prime ministers and presidents and
                    foreign and defense ministers and kings etc, the most senior political leaders
                    of most countries, the military supply relationship, military assistance and
                    arms sales, was at the top of their agendas in discussions with the President
                    and Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your general impression of the desire on the part
                        of the military to sell arms?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: There had been a directive from MacNamara in the early '60s, to push
                    sales as a way of helping out our trade balance, which was even then a matter of
                    concern. By the end of 1969, many of us were troubled by a policy that had, in
                    certain areas, destabilizing effects. One of the efforts of the Bureau and
                    certainly one I felt strongly about was to dampen down this push for sales, and
                    indeed I also sought to reduce grant military assistance because I thought that
                    in many countries it encouraged the maintenance of defense establishments those
                    countries really could not afford. But overall, as a matter of generality, what
                    this interest in arms revealed was the sense of insecurity felt worldwide. Not
                    just against communism, but world-wide, among neighbors. In Latin America,
                    Brazil, Argentina and Chile, for example. I thought Latin America as a
                    particular egregious place in that it was difficult to conceive scenarios where
                    there was a need for very sophisticated weapons at a time when the economic
                    situation in many countries was not of the best. These were, we thought,
                    misspent resources. So we tried to reduce the level of armaments going to these
                    impoverished countries. Our greatest success was in keeping the F-4 Phantom (the
                    hottest fighter plane around at that time) out of Latin America.The problem is
                    that you provide one of these weapon systems to Brazil for instance and
                    immediately Chile and Argentina want it. You provide to El Salvador, one of the
                    Central American countries, another fighter plane with less potency, but all the
                    other Central American countries want it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these weapon systems a way gaining friendships?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I think it is a caricature of it. It was asked by the political
                    leadership of those countries, and the one that was the most difficult was the
                    Shah of Iran. He really wanted to build up his forces into one of the major
                    military powers of the world, second only to the Soviet Union and the United
                    States. By the time of the revolution, in 1979, he had units that were better
                    equipped than American units. For instance, in helicopters. I felt, and I was
                    not alone, that it was a terrible waste of resources for that country.</p>
                <p>At one point, I tried to question one of the requests that had been put in for a
                    very expensive and sophisticated type of equipment that required very well
                    technically trained people. One of the concerns I've always had is by providing
                    very sophisticated weapons, we drain from the society some of the best educated
                    and ablest people to maintain and operate these weapon systems. The Iranian
                    ambassador happened to be an old friend of mine and invited me to lunch to sound
                    me out. I very gingerly explained some of my reservations. Well he reported this
                    back to Tehran and within a matter of days, I got a rocket back from the
                    American Ambassador who had been approached by the Shah and the Shah had told
                    him, “What is this bureaucracy that is trying to holdup my request?”</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: That is exactly right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to say that within the bureaucracy as a foreign
                        service officer I had nothing to do with this. I was thinking, “Are we out
                        of our minds, dumping all this stuff in that country?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Nixon and Kissinger went farther than any other administration, but the
                    fact is that seven Presidents of the United States rolled dead in front of
                    requests from the Shah for over thirty years. The argument was made that we had
                    to maintain the confidence of the Shah, we had to maintain a relationship with
                    him, help build Iran into a strong country, and in any event, if we didn't sell
                    him these widgets, the Shah would go to England, France and the Soviet Union for
                    his military supplies. And in fact, he did. This is the bind in which we found
                    ourselves.</p>
                <p>Beyond all strategic and political considerations, the French and British had
                    military industries that could not be sustained by just their internal markets.
                    They had to export. Israel also needed to export certain types of military
                    equipment. These countries- and others later on, Brazil, China, had to export
                    and they made big efforts in this regard. Anywhere we said, “Well I don't think
                    they should have this weapon system”, the country would go to Paris or London
                    and get it. The French went so far in Latin America as to send aircraft carriers
                    bearing all their wares, and put on big displays. By the '60s we no longer
                    controlled the arms trade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you looking at this as business or policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I was looking at it as policy, because I thought in many places it
                    heightened tensions, it diverted resources from more important items, like the
                    building of the economies of underdeveloped countries. It diverted the talents
                    of human resources, and I thought this was a bad allocation of resources in many
                    countries.</p>
                <p>I sought very hard to make people think about the consequences of providing major
                    weapons systems. One I developed a questionnaire to force people to analyze the
                    economic consequences for providing weapons. Because once you have a widget, you
                    have to maintain it. It is expensive. And to show how that would be maintained
                    by the economy of a recipient country.</p>

                    what the country wants, this is what it should get.” I was very much of a
                    gadfly, getting people to think about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Pentagon and ISA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The ones I dealt with didn't question these requests very much. They
                    would just shrug their shoulders. After all, the recommendations on the level of
                    support came from the MAAG's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weren't there two minds to this. On the one hand you don't
                        want to have to fight against your own weaponry if relations go wrong, as in
                        the case of the Persian Gulf, and on the other hand a savings in
                        quantity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: That's exactly right. In fact the military opinion was much more nuance
                    than divided. You had military officers who were very responsible and understood
                    very well the consequences of some of these arms transfers. You had the
                    services, for instance the Air Force, who had a very real interest in selling
                    some of their planes because it meant that the unit cost of the airplane went
                    down as they were sold abroad. This was a very real factor. But in ISA where you
                    had serving officers who were detached from the services, you had a more
                    dispassionate point of view. But the Pentagon as an institution, was interested
                    in maintaining good relationships with foreign military establishments through,
                    among other things, the sale of weapon systems. Moreover, the Pentagon had an
                    economic interest in the sale of major systems because as I said it brought down
                    the prices of their systems but also provided for a long-term relationship
                    through the needs to provide maintenance, including spare parts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem with spare parts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: One of the things I was pushing for was to shift from grant to sales, in
                    order to confront countries like Greece with the question of the cost of these
                    systems. When you give something to someone for free, it's fine and dandy, but
                    there is no appreciation of the impact on the local economy. But when you have
                    to buy something, it is another matter. I made a special effort to shift from
                    grants to sales.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view Greece and Turkey. It was obvious from
                        over there that the Greeks had only one thing in mind. A war with Turkey.
                        The Turks had to think in broader terms. How did we feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: We didn't like the automatic formula of providing eight to Turkey and
                    five to Greece. But we were not very successful in breaking that. I think the
                    effort in this area was to maintain both those countries first of all as able
                    allies of NATO, and secondly to dampen down their fears and hatred of each
                    other.</p>
                <p>I can't remember the specific about spare parts. But overall the policy we were
                    trying to push was to make countries responsible for their military defense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when they just cut off arms to the Turks,
                        in 1974?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: No I had just left there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the period of Henry Kissinger. Was there a strong
                        hand coming out of the White House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Oh yes. He considered military assistance and arms sales as an important
                    tool of overall diplomacy. But he did not appreciate some of the consequences of
                    some of the decisions. The most dramatic was the decision to provide major help
                    to support the Cambodians when Lol Nol broke away in 1970. Sihanouk was
                    traveling in Moscow and Lol Nol took over the government. The decision was made
                    to support him and to divert a hundred to two hundred million dollars worth of
                    assistance to support him. That had to be gotten from all of the other country
                    programs. So we had to scrub the whole military assistance program worldwide, to
                    come up with the sum. I went to Alex Johnson (the under secretary for political
                    affairs), and said, “This is the decision but these are the consequences. It is
                    going to create a lot of problems with the Philippines and other countries.” But
                    that's something that Kissinger considered as a bureaucratic problem and not a
                    political one. Yet it did have political consequences, in terms of our relations
                    with a lot of countries, Korea for instance. Philippines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the desks screaming to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Oh yes. But I had a pretty good command of these programs and I was able
                    to control all the desks pretty well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Someone looking at this bureaucratically they would look
                        to your office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: That's right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Israel? We didn't provide the weapons for the
                        67 war, but afterwards.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Israel, even then, was treated with profound cynicism. Because it was
                    all handled at a very senior level. And what the Israelis wanted they got,
                    pretty well. In 1969 Secretary of State Rogers and Sisco, the Assistant
                    Secretary of State for the Middle East, tried to limit the airplanes to Israel.
                    It was called the Rogers Plan and immediately became a big emotional issue.
                    Finally Israel got what it wanted.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the 1973 war, weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: And this was handled as a supply problem for the Pentagon. It was
                    completely outside any policy framework. We were dealing with regular programs,
                    and what happened in 1973 was a crisis. The decision was taken to the White
                    House and the Pentagon delivered the weapons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any reverberations. I understand the
                        military was very unhappy ..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Because they were drawing down from their own inventories to give to
                    Israel. The hottest and latest weapons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: State had no influence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: No. The Secretary was for it. The Administration made the decision.
                    There was no choice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any concern of selling arms and creating peace.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I felt quite comfortable with that issue because I don't think that
                    absence of arms necessarily leads to peace. I think it is very important in many
                    cases to remain well armed. As for instance in Western Europe.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>I think we said at the beginning that our generation has been branded with the
                    memory of the 1930s and World War II. That World War II could have been avoided
                    if the Western democracies had been stronger, firmer and better armed. So I had
                    no problem with general policy of arms transfers. It was a matter of providing
                    appropriate arms to given countries. I had no problems providing arms to Israel,
                    within certain limits, Greece and Turkey, Korea, but we had limited budgets and
                    you had to do it judiciously. I had more problems with Latin America, where it
                    was difficult to make a case that standing armies were really essential.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In many ways they seem to be used internally if for
                        nothing else, to provide a way up for lower and middle classes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: That's exactly right. It was a social mobility force. One other factor
                    that did weigh with me, I confess, that is very seldom brought out, is that it
                    is very easy from a desk in a nice office to say, “Well we won't sell arms to x,
                    y and z countries,” but the consequences of such a decision may mean closing
                    down a factory in this country. Putting workers out of work. To my mind it was a
                    very real issue to make a decision like that, knowing that the requesting
                    countries could go to England and France and some to the Soviet Union to get
                    what they wanted.</p>
                <p>I think a rather dramatic example of this is the recent example of Saudi Arabia.
                    We hemmed and hawed so long in providing reconnaissance airplanes to Saudi
                    Arabia, that they got tired and went to England. And we just passed up a $35
                    billion contract. $35 billion could keep quite a few American workers working.
                    So that was a factor that added to the difficulty of making decisions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then moved to a difficult job. You left in 1974.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I left the political-military, and spent one year as director of
                    regional affairs in the Bureau of Far East and Pacific. It was a kind of catch
                    all office. It had some very good officers and it was very pleasant. In my view
                    and as I told the new assistant secretary, a businessman from Chicago, a very
                    good man, who was later ambassador to Japan, when he came on board that he could
                    do away with this office if he wanted to, but what was important was that this
                    office be directly related to his own, as a kind of support office.</p>
                <p>In my time there, I guess the greatest accomplishment was to have written and
                    prepared the study to do away with SEATO, the Southeast Asia Treaty
                    Organization, based in Thailand, that was created in 1954, when the Geneva
                    Agreement brought an end to the war in Vietnam with the French.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>This was a Dulles creation, part of his worldwide creation of military blocs in
                    order to contain the communists. We all felt that by 1974 that organization had
                    really run its course. It was not serving much of a purpose any more. We wrote
                    the basic papers on that. The one who worked most directly and effectively on
                    those papers was Harriet Isom, who is now our ambassador in Africa somewhere. A
                    first class officer.</p>
                <p>We also dealt with military assistance and arms sales, regional problems, UN
                    affairs, drugs, it was a catch all office covering the entire Far east and
                    Pacific Basin. Very interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went on to Laos.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I returned to Laos as DCM in June 1974. My family stayed until June
                    1975, and I, until August 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The ambassador was Charlie Whitehouse. The situation was that we had a
                    very large AID mission, we had a very large military assistance program although
                    it was not called that. The situation was very, very tense and uncertain. There
                    was a national government which included the Pathet Lao under Souvanna Phouma. I
                    had been in Laos fifteen years before and Vientiane had grown. It was a much
                    more tense situation. You couldn't travel around the country. You were pretty
                    well confined to Vientiane. We could fly up to the northeast, to the Meo
                    country, the Hmong, the tribes that lived on top of the mountains between
                    Vientiane and Vietnam, and fought the Vietnamese all those years. We were
                    supplying them and the question of supplies was a very major subject. We had a
                    large AID mission that was very active, road building, providing medical
                    supplies and education, we developed textbooks in Lao and a whole educational
                    system. We built schools. We trained agriculturalists. We sought to help the Lao
                    raise their food supply by improving and diversifying their crops. The effort
                    put into that little country by the United States over thirty years was really
                    enormous.</p>
                <p>SIDE TWO</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Laos did you see any progress from when you were there
                        before, in terms of our effectiveness?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The results were a mixed bag. It is a very small fragile society, and
                    not very energetic. There were some very real accomplishments. Schools had been
                    built, hospitals had been built. There was one Western-trained doctor in
                    1958-59, now there were a hundred by the time I got back. That is real progress.
                    The young people were better educated, coming back from abroad and taking senior
                    positions in the administration, but significantly, at one of the first dinner
                    parties that Ambassador Whitehouse gave for me, attended by military officers, I
                    knew all the guests from about fifteen years before. They hadn't changed, the
                    colonels or the generals. The great families had remained in power. It was the
                    same cast of characters. Things don't change even within the Pathet Lao, some of
                    the great families were represented.It was very clear that an independent Laos
                    was dependent upon the support and active involvement of the United States; that
                    the day we weakened that support the Vietnamese who were in the eastern part of
                    Laos in force, would just take over through the Pathet Lao. Indeed this is what
                    happened.</p>
                <p>Charlie Whitehouse left for reassignment at the beginning of April, on April 15
                    Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge, on April 30, Saigon fell, and on May lst,
                    the following day, there were large demonstrations in Vientiane against the
                    nationalist ministers and generals in the government, demanding they be thrown
                    out. I immediately got the country team to fan out all over town to try and keep
                    the nationalist leadership steady. We pointed out that we were continuing to
                    support them, we had large AID and other programs that we were maintaining. But
                    fear swept the city and within ten days, the entire nationalist leadership
                    crossed the Mekong and fled into Thailand. Except for Souvanna Phouma who
                    stayed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While these events of spring of 1975 were taking place,
                        what instructions did you get. How did you view what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Glumly. The problem between the United States and Laos under these
                    circumstances was that we had played such a large role, that any indication of
                    our being concerned, that things were going badly, that maybe we should retrench
                    in some way, would have absolutely panicked the situation and any chance of
                    maintaining this dual government of the Pathet Lao and the nationalists would
                    have been finished. We would have been held responsible for the end of the
                    independence of Laos. So we were caught in this situation. Particularly after
                    May lst, when I was trying to encourage the non-communist leadership to stay on,
                    assuring them that we would continue to support them, and told everyone in the
                    American community to stay steady, and calm, and not panic. When the leadership
                    left, the situation turned more and more sour. We started evacuating our people,
                    first the families. There were about 800 Americans there, wives and children
                    included, but I wanted to maintain at least the principal officers who might be
                    able to give a degree of stability to the situation. I thought it would be very,
                    very bad if we just pulled up stakes and left, to be viewed as the abandonment
                    of Southeast Asia. So by the third week of May, we brought in some specially
                    chartered planes and started getting families out, but we were at the same time
                    continuing to have discussions with the Pathet Lao and Souvanna Phouma trying to
                    encourage them to work with us, to continue these programs. The Pathet Lao had
                    just come down from the hills and were, in retrospect just as anxious as we
                    were, not knowing just what would happen. This was their first real meeting with
                    Americans. May, June and July were very tense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any dealings with them before this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: We had met several of the ministers who were there. But after May, while
                    we continued to deal with Souvanna, we worked mainly with the Pathet Lao who had
                    taken over the government. As a community, we were terribly vulnerable, and I
                    think that one of the things that helped us get out of this terrible situation
                    in which we found ourselves was that we were in constant touch, morning, noon,
                    afternoon, evening and night with the Pathet Lao leadership and most
                    particularly, Phoumi Vongvichit who was Minister of Foreign Affairs. There was
                    sustained, continuing communication.One lesson I brought out of that period, was
                    that in a tense situation, it is essential to keep communications open. What is
                    dangerous is the fear that's built up over time to the point where the least
                    incident can be misunderstood, misinterpreted and create a very serious
                    crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of instructions were you getting from
                        Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Very little and I was very grateful. This was an essentially tactical
                    situation and I was very grateful to the State Department for not telling me how
                    to suck eggs on the spot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Phnom Penh and Saigon people were yanked out. Why
                        weren't all of you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I could have sent a telegram to Washington that said, “Situation
                    deteriorating fast, we should evacuate all personnel and close the embassy.” And
                    Washington would have said okay.</p>
                <p>I felt that it was important to maintain a presence in Laos. I felt that given
                    the role the United States had played in Asia and Southeast Asia, we could not
                    abandon ship and scurry away like a small frightened country. We were too
                    important. I thought it was important to stay there to the extent possible. And
                    if there is an embassy today in Vientiane, it is because we made that decision
                    at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I find it interesting because the view of Southeast Asia
                        was as a whole unit and if two of the capitals fall, very obviously there
                        was nothing to stop anybody from taking over in Vientiane. I would have
                        thought there was a lot of pressure to get Americans out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: We were under a lot of pressure to get Americans out. And I wanted to
                    retreat on an orderly basis. I did not want to appear that we were turning tail
                    and fleeing. We managed to get out ... planes came in and we got out many of our
                    people by air and many simply drove their cars out. All on a more or less
                    orderly basis. To me, that was important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you having trouble from your staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: They were pretty steady on the whole. In fact, I was very proud at the
                    way the Americans reacted: there was no hysteria and all remained on the job.
                    There was understandably a lot of bitterness among the AID people who had worked
                    very hard to help the Lao and many felt that we were being treated very poorly.
                    There were some nasty reactions, but by and large the American community stayed
                    very steady and disciplined.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they feel that they were being treated
                        poorly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: They felt that they had worked very hard to help the Lao and now they
                    were being thrown out of the country, with the Pathet Lao showing no interest in
                    pursuing programs that we had developed over years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you phase out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: We were in continuous discussions with the Pathet Lao leadership to see
                    if the aid programs that had been elaborated over the years, at great cost,
                    could not be salvaged for the benefit of Laos. For instance, we had an entire
                    warehouse full of medicine. There was a very large depot of earth moving and
                    road building equipment. There were programs in progress. It was to no avail.
                    The Pathet Lao held to the philosophy that politics primes all and that all
                    these matters were technical and of secondary interest.</p>
                <p>In the end, after a dramatic capture of our aid compound by so called students
                    and a fourteen hour confrontation between myself escorted by Stephen Johnson, a
                    young political officer who spoke Lao, and a mob of several hundred “students',
                    and after other varied happenings, we decided that the Pathet Lao were simply
                    not willing to pursue normal relations. Finally, one morning in June I went to
                    the office of the Minister of Economic Affairs with whom we had been negotiating
                    over aid, and just put down on his table a box full of keys- all the keys we had
                    of the aid compound. He had wanted to have a big, symbolic ceremony of turning
                    over all our assets to the government, but given their unwillingness to enter
                    into any meaningful dialogue or to recognize that we had laws prescribing the
                    disposition of assets, we left it all, noting that our laws were being
                    violated.</p>
                <p>From the beginning of May I had a country team meeting every morning to make
                    certain there was complete communication and coordination among ourselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was on the country team?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: There was General Round who was the senior military officer, head of the
                    MAAG and senior Attach�. All told we were half a dozen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically, AID, CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: AID, CIA, USIA. We met every morning at 9:00 am, and go over exactly
                    where we were. Everything was going so fast. Then each would carry out the
                    decisions in his own mission. It was mainly a question of phasing down our
                    operations and coordinating our actions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I find it very interesting that Washington was letting you
                        alone in all of this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Their concern was for the safety of Americans and that's why we
                    accelerated the evacuation by air and by car. Washington put a lot of pressure
                    on me to get my wife and three children out. They were wonderfully steady. We
                    did not feel that as the senior family we could leave before all others had left
                    safely. They finally left, the last family to leave, at the beginning of June,
                    following a particularly nasty rocket from Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>At the beginning of June, June 2nd, Phil Habib who was then Assistant Secretary
                    for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, came to take a look at the situation. I told
                    him that we had to stay calm, withdraw to the extent necessary, try to maintain
                    working relations with the government, and avoid aggravating fears. His response
                    was, “Don't be a cowboy.” He came away sensing that we could maintain relations
                    with the Pathet Lao government and that it was useful to keep an embassy
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in charge of quite an operation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I was four years in World War II as a fighter pilot and I have never
                    been so steadily frightened as in those three months, May, June and July. We
                    were absolutely defenseless as a community. With all the arms lying around
                    Southeast Asia, one kook tossing a grenade could have created a very ugly
                    situation. In the event, we got away sort of whole.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did the Laotian communist side act different than
                        Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Because it had been a completely different situation. The Pathet Lao had
                    been in the government with the nationalists; there was not a war situation, as
                    in Cambodia and as in Vietnam. Vietnam was conquered militarily. Phnom Penh was
                    conquered militarily.In Vientiane the Pathet Lao were there already and simply
                    took over completely when the nationalist leadership left. There was no
                    fighting, there was no battle. It was a completely different situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened as far as our work there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Maintaining a presence. We were down to a dozen people from eight
                    hundred. Then, at the beginning of August, Tom Corcoran came, to relieve me. He
                    arrived one morning and I left the same afternoon.</p>
                <p>Nothing illustrates better the tensions of the moment than this change of Charg�.
                    We didn't know what the reaction would be. We thought that they might try to
                    keep me. So we made the relief in the most expeditious and quiet manner
                    possible. But it was a very tense time.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>The experience of dismantling the American mission in Vientiane was very
                    illuminating. I must say, one felt that the Pathet Lao had a point when they
                    said that the United States was a state within a state in Laos. We had a police
                    force of about 5 or 600 men, with night sticks to protect the Americans in the
                    compounds. We had a fire department with a couple of fire trucks. We had an
                    infirmary, with a doctor and nurse. We had an independent telephone system
                    connecting all houses and offices. We had an independent power generation
                    capability all over town. We had all the elements of a government for our
                    community. When you take that apart, you measure the extent of the effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big had it been?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: We had had 800 people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an unclassified interview but how about the CIA
                        efforts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I don't like to speak too much about it because it was very highly
                    classified. Let's say it was a very large effort, to the point that you looked
                    at events and you wondered whether it was authentically generated by the society
                    or whether it was a CIA generated operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I spent eighteen months in Vietnam between 1969-70. I came
                        away with the feeling that we don't go in and try and win a country very
                        well. We tend to take over and cause more problems than ... I don't think we
                        are very good at this. Maybe nobody is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: To this day I find it difficult to pass a judgement. In 1958-59 most of
                    us felt that the effort being put in was not related to the strength and
                    absorptive capabilities of the society. We were putting much too much weight on
                    these fragile societies. At the same time the reason for this effort was the
                    Sino-Soviet bloc, which was indeed threatening and there were communist
                    insurgencies in Thailand and in Malaysia and in the Philippines. North Vietnam
                    was very vigorous and communist. Adding everything up it was a very threatening
                    situation. If we could have made a lesser effort and if we had let the
                    communists take over earlier, what the impact would have been on Thailand and
                    Malaysia is uncertain. I thought the domino theory was justified. I still think
                    so today. So once we became involved in that kind of effort I don't know a time
                    when we could have reduced it without seeming to abandon these countries with
                    consequences that would have been felt worldwide. When we left Saigon under
                    those dramatic circumstances in 1975, there was a shudder around the world.
                    There was real concern. In fact European attitudes changed after that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Korea later on, and they too were looking
                        differently at the US. You moved back from a very dangerous situation to one
                        that sounds quite a change.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: It was a bitter moment, I confess. I came back after three months when I
                    thought that I had accomplished a good deal, maybe in a negative sense, but at
                    least had kept the American flag planted in Southeast Asia, and to a degree had
                    contributed to reassuring the Asians that we were not abandoning them. As it
                    was, I could have come back from anywhere. Only two people went out of their way
                    to welcome me back to the department. Two lawyers took me to lunch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I find that astounding.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Absolutely. I went around the department just to say thank you for
                    having supported us, for not sending detailed instructions, and giving me a free
                    hand. I called on everyone. No one asked me to see them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You think they wanted to forget about the whole
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I think in part it was that. That spring was so traumatic. Abandoning
                    Saigon. The circumstances in which we had to leave Saigon caused such a trauma
                    that people wanted to forget Southeast Asia. Nevertheless, on a personal basis,
                    it was very harsh. If that happened to me who was in charge of the mission, I
                    wondered how would my hundreds of colleagues of lesser rank be treated?
                    Washington did not give them the time of day.</p>
                <p>There is a lack of sensitivity. Even with all these intelligent people, the
                    Department is like a machine.It is unthinking, unfeeling, and it lacks
                    imagination in the management of its personnel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to say that I completely agree. It does not

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: You would think that the desk officer, the deputy assistant secretary
                    and the assistant secretary for instance might take a personal interest in
                    people coming back from a dangerous and difficult situation.</p>

                <p>CHAPMAN: That's right. Some gesture like that.</p>

                        didn't organize this. No one bothered.</hi>

                <p>CHAPMAN: No one bothered.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Finally I mentioned this to Arthur Hartman, an old friend. And his
                    response, which I think is the right one: when all is done, only your friends
                    really count.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I came in early so I was out of phase with the assignment process. For
                    about three months I sat at a desk and did nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Out of phase.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Out of the normal cycle. There seemed to be nothing at all. For personal
                    reasons, with my family, I preferred to stay in Washington, after these
                    difficult months. The children were of an age to go to school, and I therefore
                    felt we should stay here.</p>
                <p>There was nothing available and finally I guess Eagleburger, who was then Under
                    Secretary for management, named me Deputy Assistant Secretary for Cultural
                    Affairs. It turned out to be a very interesting assignment.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The position was a real sleeper.</p>
                <p>I was in charge of the geographic desks and world-wide programs of the Bureau. I
                    had a very interesting two years there. From the vantage of this Bureau, I
                    discovered that there are hundreds of volunteer organizations throughout this
                    country involved in international exchanges in every field you can imagine.
                    Youth exchanges, arts exchanges, sports exchanges, scientific exchanges. You
                    name it. There are grass-root groups everywhere in this country. Energetic,
                    active, involved, interested groups. It is a very comforting view of the
                    country, to have to deal with these organizations.</p>

                        this type of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Bush calls it “points of light.” I'm not enthusiastic about the term.
                    But he is right. It is an enormous strength. Very creative. Some of these
                    programs, I know we are all cynical FSOs but I'm convinced, do matter.The
                    visitor program, bringing in young men and women in their '30s, or forties, to
                    visit this country - the Leader Program it used to be called - Distinguished
                    Visitors - is an important program; it pays off over time.</p>
                <p>You run into Prime Ministers and all sorts of important people throughout the
                    world who visited this country under this program years before and came away
                    with a much better understanding of the US.</p>
                <p>The Fulbright Program is one of the best known, Over the last forty years, it has
                    nurtured a remarkable group of scholars from all over the world.</p>
                <p>In the State Department, CU, as it was called, was not considered a great career
                    advancement. Nevertheless, I found it very interesting and worthwhile. John
                    Richardson was the Assistant Secretary. He was a Boston Brahmin, reserved, keen
                    and self-confident. He was also a visionary, a true believer in these programs,
                    in the whole philosophy of exchanges and he imparted a remarkable enthusiasm and
                    energy to his bureau. It was very satisfying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Carter Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The Carter Administration decided to shift CU from the Department to
                    USIA. Philosophically I had no difficulty with the principle. The new Assistant
                    Secretary, a political appointee, was a curious man who had been a minister and
                    in the '60s had been one of the radical agitators against the Vietnam war. Joe
                    Duffey was an incompetent administrator but a very nice fellow. He was very much
                    a political animal and spent much of his time on the telephone calling his
                    contacts all over town, maintaining his relationship on the Hill and the White
                    House. Although the Administration thought there would be a lot of resistance to
                    the move, in fact, like good soldiers, we just marched down that road and
                    transferred CU to USIA.</p>
                <p>It was not easy. It was a real problem, as you can imagine. You had to resettle
                    many people. The majority in CU were civil servants but there were a few foreign
                    service officers. All told we were about 220 in the Bureau.</p>
                <p>But it was very satisfying work. Very constructive and peaceful. After selling
                    arms and things like that. And very educational. You come across a whole new
                    kind of interesting, active people you would not normally meet and organizations
                    that you would not normally deal with.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any incidents you might think of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I went to India as the Secretary's representative on the Indian-American
                    Cultural Commission that had been set up some time ago to encourage exchanges
                    between India and the United States. I found that there was some real
                    reservations on the Indians' side regarding research done by some social
                    scientists who had come to India and allegedly had not followed up as they
                    promised. There was a good deal of bitterness also felt over certain American
                    studies. And so we tried to keep the doors open for further research and see
                    what could be done to improve the climate that had really soured in that
                    field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to get back to those American social
                        scientists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The American Social Science Association was represented on the
                    Commission by some of its very senior people. This was a very useful means of
                    communication with the American academic community.</p>
                <p>Another interesting point was that most countries have ministries of culture and
                    ministries for youth. Many governments have central organizations to deal with
                    such matters as culture, sports, youth. In this country, no one, no organization
                    fulfills this function. No one can speak for sports, for culture. One very
                    interesting aspect of this bureau was that it served as a communicating
                    mechanism between the private organizations of this country that dealt in these
                    fields and foreign government organizations and ministries.</p>
                <p>After India I went to Syria and Algeria, to begin negotiations on cultural
                    agreements. From our perspective, these agreements were statements of good will
                    and intent. No one in the US government could sign a cultural agreement that
                    would commit us to send over three concerts and two plays and whatever in the
                    coming year. For the Syrians and Algerians, this was difficult to understand.
                    They were prepared to undertake to receive so many professors and have such and
                    such a level of exchanges per year. On our part, it was the first time we were
                    talking to these people, and it was essentially an educational exercise: to
                    explain how the United States is organized; what are the limits of United States
                    government power and capabilities and authority. So it was a very interesting
                    experience to translate the reality of this country and its decentralization and
                    the limited nature of government power. To explain the basic weaknesses of the
                    American government to countries that had strong central governments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That brings me down to the time as an FSO trying to
                        explain in Serbo Croatian to communist officials in Macedonia the American

                <p>Then your next assignment was one that must have been sort of interesting. That
                    was as Deputy Chief of Mission in Paris.</p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: That was totally pleasant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get that assignment from 1978-82?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Because Arthur Hartman called me and asked me if I would take the
                    assignment. Arthur Hartman is a friend from Saigon days. I'm very fond of him
                    and his wife, Donna, and have great admiration for both of them.</p>
                <p>It was a totally pleasant three years with an ambassador who was thoroughly
                    professional and very highly regarded. Arthur Hartman is one of the most
                    politically sensitive persons I have ever known. He has antennas, that pick the
                    essence of situations out of the air. Very good judgement. Very broad views. A
                    strategic thinker. Highly respected in Paris and Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he operate that embassy. That is almost always a
                        political appointment, someone with money.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: He and Donna are very culturally inclined. They genuinely love the arts,
                    particularly music. They put a lot of effort into it and received a lot of
                    American artists and went out virtually every night to concerts or something. So
                    they established a climate around the embassy of being receptive to the arts and
                    to the world of the artists. Which in France, plays big. As far as running the
                    embassy, he left it largely to me. I ran the embassy, but Arthur always kept an
                    eye on what he considered problems that had to be dealt with. He was also very
                    sensitive on personnel matters. Professionally as a foreign service officer it
                    was a fascinating job. On one side you run the embassy and at the same time, you
                    have to maintain a presence in town so that when the ambassador leaves, the
                    embassy doesn't become faceless. In effect, you are doing two jobs. It means
                    thirteen to fourteen hour days every day. But it was professionally very
                    satisfying.We had 27 different agencies represented in the embassy. One great
                    advantage of being the Paris Embassy was that the agencies sent, by and large,
                    very good people. There was never a dearth of volunteers. As a result, we dealt
                    with first class professionals in all agencies, which makes all the difference
                    in the world, as you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the French bureaucracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I let my colleagues do that. I tried to have as few operational
                    questions to deal with as possible. Otherwise operations and contacts become
                    layered and confused. If I were to deal with the Quai d'Orsay extensively, that
                    would mean the political counselor would be squeezed out. It was much better to
                    give him full rein. I had a State Department house with four servants, and I
                    tried to provide support for my colleagues in every field, as they considered it
                    useful and necessary. For instance, I had luncheons for senior people at the
                    Quai to let the more junior political officers get to know them. Or when
                    American businessmen came through, the economic and commercial officers would
                    organize an event for their counterparts in the French government. I found this
                    kind support for our colleagues a very good use of our rather elegant
                    appointments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the consular operation. You had
                        consulates all over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: It was a real problem because we were under pressure to reduce the
                    number of consulates. The case had to be made that they served an important
                    purpose. Very frankly, it was a stretched argument in that, although it is a
                    very good thing to have consulates, to have an American presence around a
                    country like France. That keeps tabs on what is going on around the countryside,
                    the reality is that French political power remains very largely centered in
                    Paris. However, the power of politicians remains anchored in local communities
                    in the provinces. Typically, a French deputy spends each weekend in his
                    department nurturing his constituencies.</p>
                <p>It is also good to have consular affairs officers and commercial officers closer
                    to people throughout the country. But consular posts cannot be a top priority;
                    yet powers that be in Washington remain very attached to some of these posts,
                    all for different reasons. The most amusing was the case of Nice. We went
                    through a painful exercise of justifying this post, pointing out among other
                    things that closing it would save really very little. Nevertheless, the decision
                    was made to close it. Then, Grace Kelly wrote a Dear Ron note to President
                    Reagan, and presto it was reopened- on a more modest scale. We lost a
                    magnificent property in the heart of the city, and the Consulate General was
                    reopened in a more modest setting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This happened when they tried to close Turin. Fiat wrote
                        and you just don't close these things because there are constituencies.
                        CHAPMAN: Yes, and from the point of view of the local people, the Mayor of
                        Strasbourg for instance, felt quite genuinely that closing a US consulate is
                        a reflection on their city. (Strasbourg by the way hired a public relations
                        firm in Washington, and for whatever reason, the Consulate General was
                        saved.)</hi>

                        to know about Italy it wasn't enough.</hi>

                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The same was true in France, although perhaps not to the same degree as
                    in Italy. France is simply one of the most centralized systems in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any major issues at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: There was the transition of the Presidency from Giscard d'Estaing to
                    Francois Mitterrand, as a result of the elections of 1981, which we called wrong
                    by a hair. It was a very interesting transition, with a hard right government in
                    Washington and a dreamy left wing government coming to power in Paris.</p>
                <p>The great question was what sort of relationship would we have. I confess the
                    recommendations we sent in from the embassy were to stand aloof and tough with
                    this government to see how it would evolve. To let it define its position before
                    we defined ours. And for once I gave the Reagan White House credit of writing,
                    contrary to our recommendation, a very warm letter to Mitterrand, congratulating
                    him on his election. It also came as a surprise to the L'Eys�e. I don't know how
                    it happened, but Bush, who was Vice President, came for a get-acquainted visit.
                    The election was held over two weekends in May-June, and Bush came on the 25th
                    of June and made a twenty-four hour stop to call on Mitterrand. It came off very
                    well.</p>
                <p>The issue that had rattled Washington immediately, was the incorporation of
                    communists in the government. But Bush managed to put this in context, and I
                    guess was reassured by Mitterrand's firmness on the subject and the impression
                    that Mitterrand always gives of knowing what he is doing.</p>
                <p>I had personally one experience which illustrated the gap between the Reagan
                    Washington and the Mitterrand Paris. Early after the legislative elections, I
                    called on Pierre Beregovoy (who by the way is of Ukrainian background) who was
                    responsible for the transition and who is now minister of finance, and probably
                    the most influential Minister in the government. He received me in a small
                    office at the headquarters of the Socialist Party, where the transition team was
                    located. He greeted me at the door and said, “Alors, M. Chapman, vous vous
                    mettez dans la gueule du loup.!” (”Well, Mr. Chapman, you are putting yourself
                    in the mouth of the wolf!”) He was persuaded that Washington viewed the
                    Socialists as a dangerous threat, almost on par with the communists. I reassured
                    him on that count, and we got on very well from the beginning.</p>
                <p>One word regarding an event that received wide publicity. On November 12, 1981, a
                    young man tried to kill me in front of my house in Paris when I was the Chare at
                    the Embassy. He failed. This attempt was the first of a series of terrorist
                    attacks in France.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>The previous September, we had received an intelligence report that teams of
                    terrorists were leaving Libya to attack American Embassies in Europe. While
                    there are always alarmist messages in the air, we had taken this one seriously.
                    I was Charg� at the time and immediately called a meeting of the Country Team.
                    Together we steered a prudent course between insuring that we would continue to
                    do our job in France and maintaining tight security. It's not an obvious line:
                    the tightest security is, of course, to close an Embassy down. What we did was
                    to review all security measures already in place, tighten procedures and raise
                    security-awareness among all personnel. This too is tricky because to keep the
                    efficiency and energy of personnel up and doing their work, they must not be
                    frightened into a state of fearful caution, but they also must be aware that
                    there is a threat. The particularly difficult problem is that of families, the
                    American school being our greatest concern.</p>
                <p>In my own case, we changed my morning house-to-Embassy procedure by having the
                    driver wait in the car several blocks away, allowing me to call him by radio
                    when I was ready to go. This was the procedure I followed that November 12
                    morning. As I stepped out of the door onto the broad sidewalk and cased the
                    whole street, I noticed some 150 feet to my right a handsome young man,
                    thirtyish, bearded, Middle Eastern, and dressed in black leather pants and
                    jacket. Not only that, but he had his hand inside his jacket. A pure grade-B
                    movie scene.</p>
                <p>I normally walk fast and was already halfway across the sidewalk when I saw the
                    young man start to run towards me and heard the pops of his gun. My response was
                    to run forward and hide behind the car waiting in the middle of the street. He
                    fired six shots (as the Police later determined) and then quietly walked away.
                    No one tried to stop him as none of the witnesses, including us, was armed and
                    someone had cried from a window across the street that he had an accomplice.</p>
                <p>It did not take long for a flood of folks to invade the house: police officers,
                    prosecutors, and of course our own security people. The police process was
                    launched.</p>
                <p>The problems then were first to communicate what had happened to all personnel in
                    order to avoid false rumors creating a climate of fear, to review again all
                    aspects of security, and to deal with the media that were soon clamoring for
                    news.</p>
                <p>The Country Team is a wonderful mechanism of communication and consultation. We
                    held a meeting as soon as I returned to the Embassy. I described what had
                    happened; we discussed security once more; and for the time being, we decided
                    not to close any U.S. facility, but simply to tighten procedures. And to meet
                    together every day until we had a better appreciation of the situation facing
                    us.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>To handle the media, I decided to hold a press conference that very morning in
                    order to set the record straight and to limit the public pressure on all of us.
                    There was quite a turnout of news people, technicians, still and TV cameras. It
                    was a slow news day and this conference was the top item on Washington's morning
                    TV and radio shows. My ever-thoughtful secretary had fortunately called my wife
                    immediately to forewarn her of the events. But what was so striking was the
                    transformation of this minor event into a world-wide real happening (Ah, the
                    Information Age! It magnifies and distorts instantly.). Two months later, in
                    January 1982, one of our Assistant Military Attach�s, Lt. Colonel Charles Ray,
                    was shot in the back of the head at close range on the sidewalk in front of his
                    apartment building. In April, an Israeli diplomat, Jaacov Barsimantov, was
                    murdered in front of his family as they left their apartment building. Two
                    months later, our Commercial Counselor, Rod Grant, and his family escaped a
                    magnetic bomb that had been planted under his car. (He and his wife had taken
                    the car to drive their son to the airport. They knew nothing until they returned
                    to find the street blocked off by the Police. What happened is that, quite
                    fortuitously, an alert American Assistant Military Attach�, a Captain, happened
                    to have walked past the place where the car had been parked just after they
                    left, noticed a box in the gutter, became suspicious, and called the police. The
                    police responded very efficiently, cordoned off the street, and brought the bomb
                    experts who proceeded to examine the box. Tragically, it was indeed a bomb and
                    two experts blew themselves up. It was determined that before driving off, the
                    son had put his bag in the trunk of the car and had slammed down the lid,
                    presumably causing the device to fall to the gutter. Finally, in 1984, the U.S.
                    Consul General in Strasbourg, Robert Onan Homme, was shot and severely
                    wounded.</p>
                <p>The individuals who committed these crimes were not caught but through one of
                    these stranger-than-fiction happenings, the chief of the Lebanese Armed
                    Revolutionary Faction, Georges Ibrahim Abdullah, was arrested in 1985 in a
                    routine police check in a train after he was found with three different
                    passports. He was tried, but was sentenced to life imprisonment only after a
                    long and tortuous trial. The interesting point here is that the members of the
                    LARF were Lebanese Maronites, Christians who had espoused the cause of the
                    Palestinians and sought revenge against Americans and Israelis. As they worded a
                    statement issued after the attempt against me: “The attack is directed at Reagan
                    and his imperialist colleagues who are trying to destroy Lebanon.”</p>
                <p>A week following the attempt against me, a friend called and noted that November
                    12 is the feast day of St. Christian, and obscure Ukrainian monk who was
                    murdered by robbers in the 12th century!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in France at the time of the new ambassador, Van
                        Galbraith?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about him, he was after all, a fairly
                        controversial man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Van Galbraith is something of a mystery to me because he spent five
                    years in Paris, four years in London and one in New York, at senior levels of
                    banking, a very sophisticated world. But he is an ideologue. He considers the
                    Soviet Union, not only an enemy, but as the power that manipulates everything in
                    the world. Everything in the world can be explained by Soviet activity and
                    action. There has to be therefore an uncompromising confrontation with the
                    Soviet Union everywhere. He spent four years as ambassador in Paris and I don't
                    think that to this day he understands why anyone could possibly have voted
                    Socialist much less communist in a country where half of the vote was to the
                    left. So I never felt that he had a good grasp of the reality of France, of
                    Europe, or indeed of the world. Otherwise, he was a perfectly nice fellow.</p>
                <p>One aspect of Galbraith was interesting and challenging. He considered that, in
                    the communication world of today, the role of an embassy was limited and its
                    principal function should be to engage in public diplomacy. He really carried
                    out this view of modern diplomacy. He was always available to all the media for
                    interviews, participation in panels and reactions to events. This delighted the
                    media, greatly irritated the government (at one point they considered asking for
                    his recall), and left his staff with their eyes lifted to the skies. Finally, I
                    do not think it was an effective approach: the French being a formal people did
                    not appreciate this perceived intrusion into their internal affairs. And this
                    was a reaction of both left and right, both socialists and conservatives..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a little bit like a hostile confrontation when he
                        arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: No, he had chosen Jack Maresca who was Director of Western European
                    Affairs to be his DCM, and I was delighted. I spent two months with Galbraith
                    and then left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then your last assignment was Special Assistant on Cyprus.
                        You were there from '82-'83. Could you tell me what you were doing and what
                        was your impression.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The history of that position was that General Haig became involved in
                    the Turkish-Greek confrontation when he was SACEUR (Supreme Allied
                    Commander-Europe). He became active in trying to deal with a very difficult and
                    ugly problem. He carried over that interest when he became Secretary of State
                    and created this position, Special Assistant to the Secretary for Cyprus. Reg
                    Bartholomew was the first and I took over from him. I eventually went to Cyprus
                    to meet the cast of characters there. Called on Kyprianou and Denktash. The
                    former was formally President of Cyprus, but in reality of Greek Cyprus only,
                    and the latter was head of the Turkish Cypriot community. I also met with a
                    variety of other officials on both sides of the dividing line. I came away
                    convinced that there was nothing we could do. The problem for the administration
                    was that there was that the strong Greek American community always actively
                    pressing Congress to have the government do something. Like reducing military
                    assistance to Turkey. And the Administration considered Turkey as an absolutely
                    vital ally in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>The reason I felt that nothing could be done was that Kyprianou and Denktash as
                    heads of their communities were probably in a better position than they could
                    possibly have in a united Cyprus. Both would lose some of the power that they
                    had, and I just didn't see that they were men of the dimension who would want to
                    diminish their power or prestige by reaching a compromise even one in the
                    interest of the country. I felt that the best thing the US could do was to do
                    nothing. But politically here, it was very difficult to do nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we doing much? Was it just a charade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: It wasn't a charade. We had an ambassador and we tried to get both sides
                    to come to terms and we strongly supported the UN Secretary General who took a
                    very active role in searching for a settlement, and had a permanent
                    representative in Cyprus.. And things have not changed much in all these years:
                    just last week Greek and Turkish Cypriots were in New York working with the
                    Secretary General. The Secretary General had a personal representative on
                    Cyprus. But there was just no movement then and not much that I can see even
                    today, seven years later. I thought that the United States would be best served
                    by getting completely out of it so that both sides would not use us as a crutch,
                    as a way of trying to get at the other side. With the Greeks putting pressure on
                    us to put pressure on the Turks and vice versa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know you have to run. One last question. Looking at the
                        Foreign Service, if a young man, or young woman came to you and said, what
                        about the foreign service as a career, what would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I would tell them that I had a wonderful thirty years, very stimulating.
                    It was of course a special time. It was a time when there was a sense that there
                    was a genuine threat to the peace of the world, a time when the United States
                    played a role that has never been paralleled in history. In modern history. When
                    you were a US representative abroad, you felt that you spoke for something that
                    mattered. On issues that mattered. So it was a very satisfying time. Having a
                    sense of working on large issues in a large context. It was also a time when you
                    could go to many cities which were interesting and exotic, and fun to live in.
                    Bangkok, Manila, Hong Kong in those days were very attractive places. Tehran and
                    Damascus and Beirut. Now most of those cities are overbuilt, polluted, with too
                    much traffic, with violence. From a purely physical living situation, today's
                    cities are just not as attractive.</p>
                <p>There is also the factor of security. I always thought that security was
                    overblown, because it is a matter of being a little careful. You can't
                    generalize but there are few places today that are as pleasant, exotic, filled
                    with charm, free of violence and stimulating as there were in the past forty
                    years.</p>
                <p>But it still remains a very stimulating career. Diplomacy still provides
                    orchestra seats to observe and play a part in modern history.</p>
                <p>
