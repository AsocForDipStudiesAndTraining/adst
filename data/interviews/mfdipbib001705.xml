                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 20th of April, 2011. This is notable in that
                        it is Hitler's birthday.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh (laughs)!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this is an interview with Ambassador Ulric Haynes Jr.
                        And it's being done by telephone on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies and Training, and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. All right, and you go
                        — what — what do you go by? Ulric or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I go by Rick, R-I-C-K.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK. Well, Rick let's start at the beginning. When and
                        where were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I was born in Brooklyn, New York on June 8th, 1931. So I'm soon to be
                    80-years-old.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good, well welcome to the club. I'm 83 now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh! We're the oldest men in the world!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah, yes! OK. Well Rick, let's — let's talk — let's talk
                        about on your father's side. What do you know about them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: My parents were both immigrants from Barbados, which was, at that time,
                    the British West Indies. They came here in the first decade of the 20th century.
                    They were naturalized citizens when I was born.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Well, what was your family up to back in
                        Barbados, way back?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, they were landowners, small merchants, raised some sugarcane. They
                    were not professional people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what — were your mother and father married in
                        Barbados?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: No, they were married here in this country. My father and his family left
                    Barbados at the turn of the century and went to live in Panama when they were
                    constructing the Panama Canal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And they set up a shop in Panama that catered to the large number of
                    English-speaking Caribbean workers of color on the canal. They used those
                    workers because the American engineers could not communicate in Spanish with the
                    available Panamanian labor. My grandparents opened a shop that catered to those
                    Caribbean laborers, all of whom were people of color. The necessity for that was
                    because the naval commissary would not allow non-whites to purchase supplies,
                    food, and clothes at the commissary. So, the West Indians had to go into the
                    open market to buy. Those were the days of very rigid racial segregation in the
                    U.S. Armed Services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Navy was even more rigid than most.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: You're absolutely right. It was more rigid than the other branches of our
                    military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is your family of color?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel from your family and back about being
                        of color on Barbados?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh yes, very definitely. And I still have family in Barbados so from
                    childhood I've been going back and forth, except during World War II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes, in those days, up until I would say oh, after World War II, society
                    in all of the British West Indies was pretty fairly segregated. There were
                    signs, for example, at the entrance to the Royal Yacht Club in Bridgetown,
                    Barbados that said, “No Dogs or Colored People Allowed.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: So yes, they grew up in a very racially segregated British colonial
                    society. It was not as bad as it was over here in the United States because at
                    least they didn't go around lynching people in the British West Indies. But, it
                    was a segregated society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you get any feel for the school system and
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: On the island?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: The school system always has been outstanding. In fact, even today
                    Barbados has one of the highest rates of literacy in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your parents talk about, you know, life on the island
                        with pleasure or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: They — oh, they remembered life on the island very pleasurably. Family
                    life was very important and there was just not much interaction between the
                    British colonial civil servants, and the local population on a social level.
                    That didn't mean that people were suffering. They simply learned the rules of
                    the game and they lived by those rules.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did your — after this time while the canal — the
                        canal was finished in what, 1908 or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Something like that, yes. That was when my grandparents and father left
                    Panama and came to the United States. My paternal grandparents were hired by the
                    chief engineer of the canal, a man whose name, I'm sorry I cant remember his
                    first name, was an Admiral Pratt. And he was from Belfast, Maine. He hired my
                    grandparents as nanny for his children and butler for him. So that's how they
                    came to the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was a Brooklyn navy yard, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: No, no, no. They went to Admiral Pratt's home in Belfast, Maine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, they went to Belfast, Maine. Ah-ha. How long were they
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, I would say five to eight years and then they left and came to
                    Brooklyn, New York, where there was already a growing Barbadian community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any stories about their time in Maine?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Nothing that I recall but the fact that they constantly complained of the
                    cold weather.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughs) Oddly enough.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And my aunt, my father's sister, died of tuberculosis in Maine. So it was
                    not a place of very happy memories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, and then your parents moved to —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: My father.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your father.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes, my father and grandparents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your mother on her side? Did she come from a
                        different background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: No, she came from a small landholder background as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about education?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>HAYNES: My mother's family moved — for what reasons I cannot remember — to
                    Maywood, Illinois when they came to this country. Maywood is a suburb of
                    Chicago. And my mother graduated from Proviso Township High School in Maywood,
                    Illinois. She, she had only a high school education. My father when he came down
                    from Maine in his late teens attended the College of the City of New York, CCNY,
                    for a while, but he did not get a degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Considering the era, your parents have moved fairly far up
                        the educational latter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes, they did. For their time, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For their time. I'm still interviewing people who are say
                        around, in the 80s or so, where their parents, neither parent is a college
                        graduate, often not even a high school graduate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Right.</p>
                <p>Now, the interesting thing about my, my father particularly, even though he had
                    some college, he was not able to get employment at that time in New York City
                    commensurate with his education. And he went to work (and stayed until he
                    retired) for the Socony Mobil Oil Company, now Exxon/Mobil, as a messenger. In
                    those days, of course, even the telephone was new and everything was sent by
                    messenger from office-to-office, and usually in handwriting. And my father was a
                    messenger, as were many men of color.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Around the early part of the —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To me, it's —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Along with jobs as Pullman porters on the railroads and, especially,
                    sorting mail in the U.S. post office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes. Well, you know, people talk about having a salary
                        job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was a very prestigious thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about your mother? Was she a stay at home
                        mother?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: She was pretty much a stay at home mother. She added to the family income
                    as a seamstress. And she, she made dresses for people and, at one time, even
                    worked in the garment district in New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And also during World War II, she worked in the naval clothing depot in
                    Brooklyn, New York, in the Navy Yard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other children in this family, and where did
                        you rank if there were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, I was — like almost all of my contemporaries, I was an only child.
                    It was the height of the Depression when I was born and people just didn't have
                    large families.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: So I was — I was an only child.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like growing up? What sort of place did you
                        live in and all, in Brooklyn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, I started out life when my parents were living with my grandparents
                    in my grandparents' home. And I'll never forget taking my own children many,
                    many years later to see that home. And it was — it was tiny. I think we were
                    nine people living in that home.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>In the early 20th century, parts of Brooklyn were to New York City what
                    Westchester County is today. Wealthy white families lived in elegant mansions on
                    the main avenues. For example, the Underwood typewriter family lived there. And
                    the Pratt family who founded Pratt Institute and Socony Mobil Oil Company with
                    the Rockefellers. But, behind these grand mansions were little streets with
                    smaller houses for the servants who worked in the mansions. And it was in one of
                    these tiny houses that I was born, even though my — my family were not working
                    as servants. By this time, these tiny houses were being sold off to low-income
                    families. And what happened was that in these little houses behind the big
                    houses, little West Indian communities formed. During my early childhood, I
                    heard nothing but talk about “home” and it puzzled me, because when my elders
                    spoke about “home” they were talking about Barbados and not about the place
                    where we lived. And, and it's — as a kid, I remember being perplexed by this. I
                    wondered why they kept talking about “home” when we're at “home” now. And all of
                    our friends were people, if not from Barbados they were from the other West
                    Indian islands. It was a very insular community. And it was a community which
                    placed a very, very high value on education. So all of us children of these
                    immigrants were expected to excel in school and were certainly expected to go on
                    to college. And this in the 1930s at a time when not many people of color were
                    going to anything but segregated colleges; if at all.</p>
                <p>By the way, these West Indian immigrants could not abide racial segregation, and
                    would not think of sending their children to a segregated college in the South,
                    what we call today a historically black college or university.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, my impression is that the West Indian migration and
                        all basically had very little to do with the southern blacks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: You're very right. The migration was not one designed to escape from
                    racial discrimination or racial segregation. It was for economic reasons,
                    primarily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And also, as a child growing up, I got more hassled by my young black
                    American contemporaries, then by whites in Brooklyn, New York. There was an
                    animosity — cultural animosity between blacks from the Caribbean and blacks from
                    the American South.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You still see that. I mean in my own business we had an
                        assistant secretary, Barbara Watson, who, along with Colin Powell and others
                        who came I think out of Jamaica.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And obviously this was of, you know, I mean this is sort
                        of an upper crust that was developed over the southern white — southern
                        black.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: The Caribbean black considered themselves an educated elite. And for
                    example, as little kids, if we talked like — if we used the southern black
                    vernacular that our American black neighbors were using, we were punished.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I can certainly see that. Well, I mean it's what
                        distinguished you, in a way. I mean everybody has these markers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And for your particular group, the language would
                        certainly be the main marker.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Language and education. I mean everybody that I came in contact with was
                    more than literate. They might not even have finished secondary school, but they
                    were very literate and very well read.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I look at my own parents. Neither my mother nor
                        father went to college. But boy, did they read.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know. Speaking of which, as a young kid, were you much
                        of a reader?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Very much. I was, you know, especially being an only child, some of my
                    best friends were books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I remember the biggest thrill in my life was getting my own library card
                    to the local public library. And I can tell you, the first couple of years I
                    brought home far more books — I brought home the maximum number of books I
                    could. I think it was six. And even though I couldn't — there was no way that I
                    could finish them in the two-week lending period or whatever it was. Books were
                    very prized.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall, I mean, particularly your earlier years up
                        through elementary school, any particular books or series that particularly
                        grabbed you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes. I, I loved all the books by Herman Melville.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Especially those that had to do with the South Pacific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, Typee and —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: “Typee” and “Omoo”, oh I devoured them and re-devoured them and devoured
                    them again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Jack London?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And I didn't — not Jack —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because he wrote about the South Seas too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: No, but Melville spoke to me for some reason.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh. Well, you couldn't do better than that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: No siree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, as a kid in Brooklyn, let's think again up through
                        elementary school. Before we turn to school itself, what was it like? Were
                        you sort of after class turned loose in the streets and?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: No — well, no, no, no. It was — it was a very different generation. And
                    even though I grew up in what were subsequently to become segregated — racially
                    segregated neighborhoods, I grew up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh my God, yes. That later became notorious.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes. Well, at that time it was a neighborhood in transition. And I had as
                    many white neighbors as I did neighbors of color. And my playmate were of both
                    races. My classmates in elementary school were of both races. And an interesting
                    thing that shocks current generations of young blacks is that, in all of my
                    schooling from kindergarten through law school, I never had a black teacher. I
                    grew up in a time when teaching positions for black people were very hard to
                    come by.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: So all of my teachers were white.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And probably most of them were Jewish.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Not at all! I would say Irish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Irish.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Irish and German where I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah-ha.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: It wasn't until I got to high school that I began to — well, I — when I
                    went to high school, we were a student body of 3,000 students and only two of us
                    were black. The other 2,998 were overwhelmingly Jewish. And as a result, when
                    the Jewish holidays would come we two black students took them off along with
                    everybody else. In fact, there were no teachers there either. So my secondary
                    school education was very strongly influenced by Jewish refugee families from
                    Nazi Germany in Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's go back to the elementary school.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First place, was your family religious and what religious
                        if so?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>HAYNES: They came to this country as staunch members of the Church of England,
                    and they were practicing Episcopalians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that an important element in your life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Not so much, because from a very early age I developed a distaste for
                    Sunday school. It ruined my after church fun. And I was not very happy with it.
                    I did get confirmed as Episcopalian, but no, it wasn't. But, it was an important
                    social part of our family's life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about in politics? Where'd your mother and father and
                        maybe the rest far into the political spectrum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, my father, to my utter horror, as a young man growing up and
                    becoming politically aware in high school and certainly in college, was, was a
                    staunch Republican. And although in later life I was able to persuade him to
                    vote Democrat while registering as a Republican. And, and he did so not just to
                    please me, but he was convinced also that the Democrats were more interested in
                    issues of concern to him than the Republicans.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First place, coming from the islands, was music important

                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Enormously important. My father's wedding gift to my mother was a baby
                    grand piano.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I mean, and that must have taken a hell of a lot of money at the height
                    of the Depression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: God yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And that piano stayed in the family, well, until my parents' death. And
                    my mother became quite an accomplished pianist, and tried to impose piano
                    lessons — in fact, did impose piano lessons on me so that I could play the piano
                    fairly well. But music was a very, very important part of our, our life.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>HAYNES: We were — our family loved calypso. All the more so because they were —
                    because of their timely commentary, they were hilarious. I mean there were
                    calypsos absolute every important world event. I remember there was a calypso
                    about the abdication of King Edward VIII and his marriage to that Simpson woman.
                    And as a matter of fact, I do remember vividly my grandparents huddled around
                    the radio to listen to the Edward VIII abdication message, with tears rolling
                    down their faces. I didn't understand it. I didn't understand what it was all
                    about, but later on I recognized that, you know, for all their American
                    citizenships they were still royalists!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes. What about after school? What were you kids up

                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: We were up to playing in the street, playing street games. But those were
                    the days when the street was not a dangerous place. I mean there weren't that
                    many automobiles coming through the streets of Brooklyn at that time. I believe
                    there were maybe four family-owned automobiles on our block. And it was — and it
                    was also before the days when, when families put their older people into nursing
                    homes. So there was always an old lady leaning out of a window or sitting on a
                    stoop who kept an eye on everybody.</p>

                    could get in. But there were neighbors around who kept an eye on us and kept us
                    out of trouble.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: — various things, and you know, and everybody had to go
                        home at 6:30 or 6:00 for dinner.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: You got it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean that was —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: You got it. And, and I remember to this day, we used to play games, I
                    don't — and of course the games were played in the suburbs and in the rural
                    areas were a little different. But in New York City we played stickball —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mm-hmm.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: — with a tennis ball and a broomstick and — a cut off broomstick. And we
                    played Ringolevio, Johnny on the Pony, Skelly with bottle tops. There were a
                    whole host of games that were played in the city that today's generation of
                    young people have no idea about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about at home? You had quite a large family, I mean
                        extended family at your home, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yeah. Until I was about five-years-old. And then, then my parents moved
                    into an apartment of their own and there were just the three of us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you sit around — were there sort of family
                        discussions over the dinner table and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes, but I, I grew up in the era of children are to be seen and not
                    heard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mm-hmm.</hi>

                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>HAYNES: So I could listen, and I learned a lot by keeping my mouth shut and
                    listening, but I — I rarely, if ever, participated. And we lived in a house with
                    grown up cousins and so forth, and friends, among the nine people in our home. I
                    was never allowed to call anyone by their first name. It was Aunt Mary and Uncle
                    Joe, but never Mary and Joe. And if I dared to call them by their first names,
                    that was an occasion for serious punishment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was World War II — you were still kind of young, but you
                        were old enough for, for, you know, to be picking up things. Did that play
                        much of a role in your —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes. I mean for — up until I was about 10-years-old, more — I guess 12
                    even — I had never known anything — most of my life war was raging. I mean there
                    were wars — I was acutely aware of the Sino-Japanese War and Spanish Civil War,
                    wars that you ask students about today and they draw a blank. And of course
                    World War II. I had cousins who went off to war, older second cousins.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one of the things I found, for example, I became
                        addicted to maps and I could, you know, find obscure places —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: — you know, all the, the islands, the various places, and
                        Russia and, you know, in south — North Africa and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, you know, I think — you're absolutely right. But I got that
                    information from doctor's offices where I poured over the National Geographic
                    magazines. And they became my buddy. When I was old enough to travel on the New
                    York subway alone I would take a quarter — it would take me 10 cents, a nickel
                    going and a nickel coming to travel on the subway. And I would go over to the
                    3rd Avenue secondhand bookstores in Manhattan where I could pick up old National
                    Geographics for a nickel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And I'd come home with three of them. I'd take 15 cents of my quarter to
                    buy them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>HAYNES: And, and that's how I learned — well, I attribute those magazines to my
                    interest in things international. They were my teachers with their pictures of
                    exotic places. Oh my goodness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yeah. Well, National Geographic, and the maps you could
                        get from them too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And the maps, yes. Oh, I was terrific at geography, and history even,
                    because of those National Geographics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, National Geographic, at least for me, was my first
                        glimpse of bare breasts of Balinese women, which I thought very —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Ha, he, ha! I remember my grandmother snatching a National Geographic
                    away from me and saying that they were not for me to look at.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughs) Oh yes. How about in elementary school? What were
                        your favorite and least favorite courses?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, let me think. In elementary school, reading and English were my
                    favorites. Math was my least favorite. Geography was another favorite. Oh, I
                    loved geography. We didn't get into history until I got into secondary
                    school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was your elementary school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: It was within a short walk of our home in Brooklyn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the name of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: It had no name. In New York City in those days, they gave numbers to
                    elementary schools. Ours was Public School 70.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah-ha. Well —</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>HAYNES: I'll never forget, our principal — many of our teachers in that public
                    school were of German or Irish descent. Our principal was Mr. Hoenekamp. And our
                    music teacher was Miss Schreiber. In each of my schools there was at least one
                    teacher who served as a mentor to me, and who guided me through my studies in a
                    way that allowed me to go to an outstanding high school and then to Amherst
                    College and Yale University. Were it not for those teachers, who at an early age
                    took an interest in me regardless of my race, and they were all white, I
                    wouldn't have made it in the world as I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall the names of any of these teachers? Let's
                        stick to elementary school because I like to have them mentioned in this
                        oral history.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I remember my first grade teacher was a Miss Brown. My second grade
                    teacher was a Miss Wynn. My fifth grade teacher was a Miss Fitzgerald. And then
                    of course I remember vividly all of my teachers in high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, where did you go to high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I went to Midwood High School, in a predominantly upper middle class
                    Jewish neighborhood in Flatbush, Brooklyn. And it was a fortunate choice because
                    the families of the students who went there, as I said being predominantly
                    Jewish refugees had inculcated in their children that academic excellence was
                    the only way that they were going to make it in our country. So, the pursuit of
                    academic excellence became the norm. And it became something that I pursued,
                    along with my classmates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you meld into this Jewish predominant group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes (laughs). It's funny. So much so, that to this day there are many — I
                    don't speak Yiddish fluently, but there are many Yiddish expressions that come
                    to mind for certain situations. My nickname among my, my Jewish friends and
                    their families was “schoene schwartze” (good looking black guy). “Schwartz,” of
                    course in Yiddish and German for black.</p>
                <p>So I was the good-looking black kid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughs) Because I'm sure —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I wore that title with pride throughout my years in high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about dating in high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Mmmm, I socialized with my Jewish peers. But, I didn't date across racial
                    lines, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In elementary school you mentioned that there wasn't much
                        in the way of history taught early on, but what about high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: We were especially interested in current history. The reconstruction of
                    Europe and the creation of the State of Israel, Zionism was something with which
                    I was very familiar. And of course, civil rights. It was not yet a period of, of
                    civil rights activism. But, I was acutely aware of, of racial segregation. My
                    parents often discussed it at home. And it, it became something that I was
                    almost instinctively dedicated to ending.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly the refugee groups there, did — were you
                        picking up — did this connect you more, you might say to European history
                        and what was happening there, as well as Israel than probably you would have
                        gotten somewhere else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. And that also stimulated my first trip to
                    Europe, which came in 1951 when Europe was still recovering from World War II.
                    And I'll never forget the evidence of destruction that I saw in France, in
                    Denmark, in Norway and in Germany. It was a sobering and a maturing
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in extra curricular activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh lots. Yes, indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, debating, dramatics, student government. I was actually elected
                    president of my graduating senior class in high school.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there attempts to get the students involved in any
                        particular political things or? Was this — this is still Eisenhower period,
                        which was relatively quiet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, yes. We students were anything but conservative. It was a heyday of
                    the Labor Union Movement. And the parents of many of the students were members
                    of labor unions. We were very conscious — or I was very conscious — of economic
                    class differences and at home I was made conscious of the prevailing racial
                    discrimination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, many of the Jewish immigrants came out of Europe and
                        sort of European socialism, was that — and very much involved in that
                        particular — particularly in the New York area. That particular, when I say
                        political —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I wouldn't say that there were many of the students who were socialist.
                    In fact, I doubt that many of them knew or even wanted to know what it meant, or
                    even what, what communism was about. But we had a very strong sense of and
                    dedication to social service and the social welfare.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mm-hmm.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: But I wouldn't call it socialism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. Well, did you have any idea of where you wanted to
                        go when you graduated from high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, yes. I definitely knew that I wanted to go to college. And it was
                    thanks to one of my father's — remember, I told you my father was a messenger
                    for the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company. One of the executives in the division that he
                    worked in, which was Marine Sales, was a member of the Pratt family that had
                    founded the company along with the Rockefellers. And the Pratts were major
                    benefactors of Amherst College. And one day Mr. Pratt asked my father, “Hey,
                    what about your son? Isn't he about ready to go to college?”</p>
                <p>And Dad said, “Yes.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Well, where's he thinking of going?”</p>
                <p>And my father said, “Well, City College, Brooklyn College, maybe Howard
                    University.”</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>And Mr. Pratt said, “What? Never.” He said, “He's going to go to Amherst
                    College.” He was very fond of my father. And you know, Mr. Pratt made it happen.
                    I went to Amherst with a full scholarship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I never knew whether he — although I suspected it — contributed to the
                    payment of my tuition, room, and board, but I did get that full scholarship,
                    which I hadn't even applied for. And the rest is history.</p>

                        different world, wasn't it, from Brooklyn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I thought I'd landed on the moon! It was very different. And I mean, for
                    example, my — I'll never forget my embarrassment. My mother had very carefully
                    gone out and gotten me a new suit, nice trousers and shirts and things, and I
                    was all wrong. Everybody — everybody around me who'd gone to boarding schools
                    were wearing chino pants, and sneakers. For formal occasions they threw on a
                    navy blue blazer over their chino pants. My college wardrobe was all wrong.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: White bucks, yeah, exactly. And I was dressed all wrong.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From 50 — '46 until — I was the class of '50. So I know
                        the era and the time very well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Right. Well, one of the good things about that era was that there were a
                    significant number of returning veterans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Veterans of World War II. This made for a much more mature environment
                    than even exists today for entering college students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. I've heard people, the faculty back now, but talking
                        about the, the difference in that immediate post war classes, because they'd
                        been there, seen that, you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: That's right. That's right. And a lot of the frivolous activities like
                    fraternities didn't appeal to those vets. You know, it — it just seemed childish
                    to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It did. No, it was a different world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: It was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What subjects did you — what was your major and how did
                        you —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: My major was political science. And I did an honors thesis for my senior
                    thesis under a political scientist pretty well known named Karl Loewenstein.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Karl Loewenstein was also one of the interpreters at the Nuremberg
                    Trials. So he came with a lot of interesting anecdotes that brought the subject
                    of political science to life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find social life there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>HAYNES: No problem because there were black girls at Smith and Mount Holyoke and
                    Wellesley and Vassar. Not many, maybe three or four at each school. But, we all
                    knew each other before we went to college. One of the ways that black people had
                    of surviving in the days of rigid segregation, was to develop a network of
                    contacts that allowed us to connect around the country. For example, if my
                    family were driving from New York to Washington, DC, they had to know some
                    families along the way where they could stop and get a meal because we were not
                    allowed to eat in restaurants once we passed the Mason Dixon Line. And we were
                    even unwelcome in places like New Jersey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, you know, it's incredible but I lived in Annapolis
                        where they had separate drinking fountains.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: You remember them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes. Different movie house. I mean there wasn't even a
                        segreg — I mean, blacks had their movie house, whites had their movie
                        house.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Right. Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's terrible. But did —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And oh, by the way, speaking of Annapolis, there was an enclave, a black
                    enclave not far from Annapolis called Highland Beach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And middle class black families from Washington, DC used to have summer
                    homes there.</p>
                <p>Q; Yeah. And you know, again, you know, within the black community, I'm told that
                    there are sort of almost color designations for different —</p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh yes. Less today than at that time, but at that time definitely.
                    Definitely. I mean light skin went along with belonging to the upper
                    socioeconomic class. And most of my contemporaries of color in the Ivy League
                    schools, when I was going to school at Amherst, were light skinned black people.
                    They were the children of privilege.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you still, you know, particularly in the arts or
                        something, in the movies and all, I mean whatever it is, it's still pretty
                        apparent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, you know, one of the things about the film industry today is that
                    (and this is interesting because I have a son who works in the film industry in
                    Hollywood) if you think about it — there is a place in the movies and among
                    entertainers for a very beautiful light tan or light brown skin black women,
                    like Halle Berry or like Lena Horne.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dorothy Dandridge.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Dorothy Dandridge. You're absolutely right. But there is not an
                    equivalent place for handsome light skinned black men.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And the reason for that, I am convinced, is that going back to the days
                    of segregation, the last thing that white male movie producers want is for white
                    females to be attracted to black men.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh absolutely. And I'm sure of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: So they keep good looking black men off the stage and screen. Denzel
                    Washington and Sidney Poitier are certainly not among the most handsome black
                    men that you've ever seen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I can assure you that there are some Brad Pitts out there with brown
                    skin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I — looking at it from the reverse side, I lived in
                        Annapolis, although we were from a northern family. As a matter of fact, my
                        grandfather had been a — well, a major under Sherman.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: No kidding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughs) Yeah. But anyway, Annapolis was a navy town, very
                        segregated. And I was just a kid, but I remember when I saw Lena Horne I
                        thought, “What the hell is this miscegenation thing?” It didn't appeal to me
                        at all, particularly when I was looking at Lena Horne. I mean —</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>HAYNES: (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about at Amherst? Did you find race played any role in
                        sort of your social life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: No, I'll tell you, a funny thing happened to me about halfway through my
                    freshman year. I was just — let me think now — I was 16 when I went to Amherst,
                    and I didn't shave very often. But one day I'd been there — I'd been there for
                    at least a semester. There was a special occasion and I was going to shave. And
                    I looked in the mirror and I was shocked by what looked back at me! I'd
                    forgotten that I was black! Literally. And no, Amherst was, was a very
                    comfortable place for me, and a place of acceptance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any teachers — you mentioned Dr. Loewenstein —
                        but any other teachers that particularly attracted you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh yes. Well, first of all the dean of admissions and his wife became
                    very good friends. His name was Eugene Smith Wilson, Bill Wilson as he was
                    called. And he became a special friend and mentor. And the head of the theater
                    department, Curtis Canfield, who went on to become the Dean of the Yale School
                    of Drama was a special friend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And oddly enough, even though I was — I was a mediocre math student,
                    Professor Robert Breusch, a German Jew again, became a good friend. He was my
                    calculus professor who took me to his office one day and he said, “You know, you
                    are deathly afraid of math.” And he said, “I'm going to teach you to if not love
                    it, like it and enjoy it.” He said, “Math is a game. Come along and play the
                    game with me. Just learn the rules. Come and play with me and you're going to
                    have fun. We're going to have fun,” he said. And you know what? He was right. I
                    went from being a C math student to being a B+, which was quite an
                    achievement.</p>
                <p>Q; And those were real grades too in those days.</p>
                <p>HAYNES: Those were real grades.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: So he was a special friend. And then there was a German Jewish family in
                    town, Dr. and Mrs. Merzbach, M-E-R-Z-B-A-C-H. He was the town obstetrician.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mm-hmm.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: He and his wife saw me in a play at Amherst and they invited me over for
                    dinner. And that was a big deal because to get away from institutional meals was
                    a real treat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: The Merzbachs and their children have remained friends of mine. In fact,
                    I'm going out to Los Angeles next week — and I'm going to be seeing their
                    daughter who became a vice president at 20th Century Fox. And I used to babysit
                    for her!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And I tease her by telling her, “I changed your diapers.” But no, and
                    then the college chaplain, John Coburn. Oh, he ultimately became the dean of
                    Boston Theological Seminary. Anyhow, I had many friends on campus and, and
                    indeed, because my family didn't have much money on big vacations, I couldn't
                    afford to go home for short holidays, for example for Thanksgiving or Easter.
                    And I always had an invitation to a local home. And even the homes of some of
                    the few black families in town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I take it you were involved in the dramatic arts.
                        What plays were you in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh well, in Shakespeare's “Hamlet” I played the ghost of Hamlet's father,
                    which I played in heavy grey makeup. I played in “Front Page.” My memory's
                    failing. But anyhow, I ultimately was admitted to the Dramatic Honors Society,
                    the Masquers at Amherst. I appeared in quite a few plays.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well yeah, in my class we had a rather young guy who, who
                        was very much involved in musical plays there named Steven Sondheim.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh yes (laughs)!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know whatever happened to him, but I hope he did
                        well. I'm looking at the time —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: We had one at Amherst who preceded us. His name was Burgess Meredith.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh my God, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes. There was quite an acting tradition at Amherst.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. Well, I'm looking at the time. This is probably a
                        good place to stop. And we'll pick it up the next time when you graduate in
                        1952 and where did you go and why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: OK. This has been — this has been relatively painless!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh sure!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I've enjoyed talking with you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the thing is I'm trying to illicit from you, you
                        know, the period. And you're doing very well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, thank you. You're kind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And I look forward to speaking with you again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK. Let's take a peak at the calendar. You got one
                        there?</hi>
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Thank you. This is a more secure line, but you know, when you live in the
                    boondocks sometimes the signal fades in a storm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK. Rick, let's — I wonder if you could either compare or
                        contrast or however you want to do it, was the Yale system at law different
                        than sort of the case system at Harvard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Not at all. We used the case system as did almost all of the law schools
                    in the country at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find yourself concentrating on any
                        particular area of the law that you got through after the initial year and
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: No. In order to pass any state's bar exam, you have to have a very broad
                    knowledge of the law. And like all the other law schools, Yale prepared us in
                    that fashion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Uh-huh. What was the student body of the law school like
                        when you were there —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Extremely bright and ethnically speaking, I, I was the only black student
                    in my class to graduate. We started out with, with three of us and the two
                    others dropped out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about girls? Women?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I believe there were six in my class of one hundred or so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that most of your colleagues and yourself,
                        but I mean were aiming at any particular law firms or government jobs, or
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: In law school I would say most of them were headed toward private
                    practice in the top law firms in the major cities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you point yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, it was very difficult. You know, let me go back to Amherst. At
                    Amherst, I was one of two black students in a class of 200. In those days in our
                    colleges and universities there was a racial quota at Amherst. I believe the
                    quota for Jewish students was 10 and for Roman Catholics was 20. And no effort
                    was made to hide the fact that there were quotas; it was just an accepted
                    fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, at Yale did you feel any sort of discrimination or
                        how the school was handling you at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>HAYNES: No. I was held up to the same standards of academic performance as my
                    white peers. Where it did matter was when it came to graduation and seeking jobs
                    with major law firms. I would initially get interviews because in those days
                    they didn't ask one's race. When you came from a place like Yale and Amherst
                    they just assumed you were white. And with a first name like Ulric they assumed
                    I was of German background which is not the case. And there was general surprise
                    when I would show up for my interview. And time and again, I would get the same
                    response from the interviewer: “Well, we would love to have someone of your
                    background and academic performance, but our clients wouldn't like it, they
                    wouldn't feel comfortable with a black attorney.” And in one case, I will never
                    forget — and I'm trying to think now. There was — oh, what was his name? He was
                    the first black Cabinet member. I believe he was appointed by Nixon as Secretary
                    of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, I —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Samuel Pierce was his name. I knew his brother well. Sam Pierce was a
                    black attorney with a prominent New York law firm. I believe it was
                    predominantly Jewish. And when I came for my interview, he was the one who
                    interviewed me and he really enraged me by telling me, “I've got to tell you
                    straight off, that I'm the black man in this firm and we don't have room for
                    another.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh boy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I — I was furious. I wanted to punch him in the nose. But of course
                    having been nurtured as a gentleman at Amherst and Yale, I didn't do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughs) Well, did — I would think that there would be a
                        natural — given the period, that it would be much more possible to sort of
                        look towards government work at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, yes. As it turned out, my first job was with the New York State
                    Department of Commerce. I was working as an assistant to their legal counsel and
                    I got that job — oddly enough for two reasons. I got it because Averell Harriman
                    was the Governor of New York State at that time, and he was running for
                    reelection. And he thought it — and his people thought it would be a good idea
                    for him to appoint a young black attorney to his team in order to attract the
                    black vote in New York State. That was one reason. The second reason was as a
                    law student, I had worked as a freshman counselor on the undergraduate campus of
                    Yale University. It was a way of getting my room and board paid. And one of my
                    counselees was a young man named Peter Duchin, the bandleader Eddie Duchin's
                    son.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, the band —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Band leader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very much the — he was the society —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Very —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: — society bandleader.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And Peter Duchin was Averell Harriman's godson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: So when Peter heard that Harriman was interested in my getting a job in
                    his administration, Peter waded in and told his godfather, “Hey look, you got to
                    hire this guy. He's my friend.” And the rest is history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah. Well, all right. How long were you working for the New
                        York Department of Commerce?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I worked there for about two and a half years, and I ultimately became
                    Executive Assistant to the Commissioner of Commerce. And I left the Department
                    of Commerce when Averell Harriman lost the gubernatorial election to Nelson
                    Rockefeller. And at that time I applied for a job with the UN (United Nations)
                    Secretariat, and got it. And I was assigned to the European Office of the United
                    Nations in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's go back to New York. How did you find the
                        atmosphere, politically and all, in this part of the New York State
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Do you mean was there any racial —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I was thinking more on the political side, but
                        racial too. But how did you find working —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, I was very happy there. I enjoyed my work. There was no racial
                    tension. I was living in — of course I was living in Albany, New York, at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you — I mean were there political issues that you all
                        had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh yes, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Such as?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, I remember one of the first issues that I dealt with New York State
                    emerging as a major producer of quality wine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And the first thing I did was work on some legislation to encouraged the
                    development of vineyards in New York State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved with the legislature there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, yes. I was doing legislative bill drafting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, and there's always been intense interest in New
                        York being the big state that is, in their legislature. And how did you find
                        working for the people who went there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, I worked mostly close with the Governor's Office. He had
                    specialists on his team who dealt directly with the legislature. So I was
                    reporting to those who had direct contact with the legislature. I did not have
                    direct contact with the legislature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for Governor Harriman and his
                        operation at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Because of my relationship with his godson, he took a personal interest
                    in me. And a couple of times I was invited to the Governor's Mansion to have
                    dinner with him and his wife at that time, Marie Harriman. And he was delighted
                    to find out that I had an interest in international relations, because of course
                    he had had by that time had an already brilliant career as ambassador to England
                    and to the Soviet Union and as a foreign policy advisor to Presidents Roosevelt
                    and Truman.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Exactly. So, he was delighted to find someone on his staff who shared his
                    interest in international affairs. He was very kind to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And indeed, if I can just jump ahead a bit. It was thanks to him that I
                    moved into the Kennedy administration in the State Department in 1963.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah-ha. OK, well let's go to the UN. You were with the UN

                <p>HAYNES: I was a — I'm trying to think of the title now. I worked — my job was
                    recruiting military and police officers for the UN Palestine peacekeeping
                    mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that should have been interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: It was very interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>

                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>HAYNES: And I was detailed to the United Nations Development Program to go to
                    Guinea, which had gotten its independence from France. And because I was fluent
                    in French I think that's one of the reasons why I got that post. We were
                    responsible in the United States Development Program for advising the Guinean
                    government on how to set up a government because de Gaulle and the French were
                    so angry with, with President S�kou Tour� and Guinea at the time. France had
                    asked their former African colonies to join the French Community that France was
                    trying to form into something equivalent to the British Commonwealth. And Guinea
                    was the only former French African colony that refused to join. So, in
                    vindication, the French colonial officers in Guinea either destroyed or took all
                    of the administrative records of the colony with them. And the Guineans,
                    therefore, had nothing with which to begin an independent government. The UN
                    stepped in and helped them. And I was on that UN team. I was a young assistant
                    to the specialists from around the world who were helping the Guineans to draft
                    a constitution and to set up a functioning parliamentary system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, before we move to that, I'd like to go back to the
                        Palestinian thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yep.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we doing from the United Nations point of view
                        to deal with, with the situation in Palestine?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: The United Nations was setting up a peacekeeping mission to prevent armed
                    conflicts between the Israelis and the Palestinians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: That mission, by the way, still exists. It may have a different name, but
                    it's still got UN peacekeepers, for example, on the border with Lebanon and
                    Syria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, actually wasn't it in '62 when Secretary U Thant
                        pulled UN troops out of the Sinai which helped start the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, yeah — my recollection is that they — they, they never left. There
                    may have been an attempt to do so, or a threat to do so, but by 1962, I was
                    already in Africa working for the Ford Foundation. I was no longer with the
                    United Nations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, well back to Guinea. Did you get any look at
                        S�kou Tour� and how he operated.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, very much so, very, very much so. I got to know — in those days the
                    leaders and their, their supporters that were young people, they were young
                    people, many of them educated in France. And so they were my chronological
                    contemporaries, and I got to know many of them personally. I did not get to know
                    S�kou Tour� personally, although later on in about 1960, '61 when I was working
                    for the Ford Foundation in Nigeria, John F. Kennedy asked Averell Harriman to
                    make a tour of the emerging nations of Africa to give him advice on the
                    formulation of American foreign policy in Africa. Harriman got in touch with me
                    in Nigeria and asked me to accompany him on his mission to Africa because I was
                    again, fluent in French and familiar with Africa. And during that fascinating
                    trip I was able to meet L�opold Senghor, Felix Houphouet-Boigny in the Ivory
                    Coast, and Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana, as well as Patrice Lumumba in the Congo and
                    the Abb� Fulbert Youlou in the Congo-Brazzaville.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: The emerging Congo was very turbulent at that time. It was a fantastic
                    trip for a young man like me to make. To be able to sit down with a great
                    American statesman and meet with these emerging African leaders who were the
                    founders of their countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean coming back to S�kou Tour�, he, at least later on,
                        had a reputation of being a pretty ruthless person, putting people in jails
                        and just letting them rot there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, he was a product of the French Labor Movement. He was a labor union
                    organizer and he brought that approach to control into his government, and it
                    was pretty heavy handed, yes. It was very heavy handed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean of all the various leaders who emerged in that part
                        of the world, he came out with the — well, one, he was there a long time,
                        but he never really softened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Sekou Tour� kept control of the government of Guinea during the time that
                    he was president, close control. And if that meant jailing people, intimidating
                    people, he used those tactics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, as you were working on say, a constitution, the
                        French certainly ended up with no friends in Guinea, particularly at the
                        top. So where would you — were you looking to other countries in Europe or
                        the United States to serve as an example for a constitution?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, it was very apparent that none of the leaders in Africa had any
                    respect for, nor any experience, for that matter, with constitutional
                    government. So to them, the constitution, or any constitution the UN might have
                    helped them to draft, was pretty much — pretty much a document to be
                    ignored.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So if you had to have one and so you made up one, but it
                        depended on the leader.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: It did. And, and none of them, from L�opold Senghor to Kwame Nkrumah
                    certainly not Patrice Lumumba, none of them had any experience with
                    constitutional government, and, therefore, they had no respect for a
                    constitution as a document, as a binding legal document.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On this trip with Harriman, what was he looking for? Or
                        just to get a feel for what the situation was or —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: He wasn't looking for anything. At that time, at — even at the upper
                    echelons of the State Department — we were not very knowledgeable about what was
                    going on in the African continent as these nations rapidly moved to become
                    independent. At that time, there was no Bureau of African Affairs. There was a
                    bureau — there was a subdivision of the Bureau of European Affairs that dealt
                    with colonial affairs. But, there was no Bureau of African Affairs. The Bureau
                    of African Affairs was created by Kennedy as a sop to Governor G. Mennen
                    Williams who was a disappointed Democratic presidential aspirant. Remember Soapy
                    Williams?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Soapy Williams had been a potential candidate for the president of the
                    United States, and he did not get the Democratic Party nod. And as a sop,
                    Kennedy created the Bureau of African Affairs in the State Department and made
                    him the first Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. And Soapy
                    Williams took his job very seriously. He was very rough at the edges, but very
                    well intentioned, highly motivated. But, he did not speak French which was the
                    language most widely in use in Africa. And that got him into a lot of trouble. I
                    traveled with him in Africa as his State Department escort officer and as his
                    interpreter. And as his familiarity with French increased, he insisted on using
                    it more and more — sometimes to the great embarrassment of us Americans and his
                    hosts. I'll never forget — and here I'm going to use some not so nice language,
                    so maybe —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, this is a pretty informal —</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>HAYNES: OK.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: — medium.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I'll never forget. The foreign minister of the New Republic of the Congo
                    headed up by Lumumba came to Washington and Soapy Williams gave a luncheon for
                    him at the State Department. And as is the practice, Soapy rose to give a toast
                    to his guest. I moved to Soapy's side to translate his remarks and he brushed me
                    aside and said, “No, I don't need you this time.” And he went on to say in his
                    very, very broken French and— do you speak French?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, he said — I'll give it to you. He said, “J'ai toujours consid�re le
                    Congo la queue de l'Afrique.” What he wanted to say was, “I have always
                    considered the Congo the heart of Africa.” What he ended up saying was, “I've
                    always considered the Congo the asshole of Africa.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, his guests who spoke French were aghast. And his American guests
                    who, who spoke French were thinking, “My God, what a blatant display of
                    honesty.” But I'll never forget, there were, you know, there was a rumbling of
                    chuckle afterwards as people realized that he had made this gaff. But he often
                    did — he often did — I'll never forget, we went to Guinea. And Soapy Williams
                    was a multimillionaire. He came from the —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shaving cream family and all that sort of —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Shaving cream, yeah, yeah, exactly. He had that fortune. And yet he
                    always insisted that we travel economy class in Africa. He did not take a U.S.
                    military plane as Averell Harriman always did when he traveled abroad. He
                    traveled commercially. And we always traveled in economy class. Well, the
                    Guinean government had an armed guard waiting when our plane arrived and they
                    rolled the red carpet up to the front exit where first class passengers
                    exited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you — just one second. We're just going through the
                        process of selling our house, which is —</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ugh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: That's an important process these days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh God, well yes, and we — ugh. Anyway, we've moved to
                        retirement home and that's a real adjustment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: We — it's funny, I'm looking at the same prospect myself and discovering
                    that in terms of price our house is under the water. We would lose so much in
                    selling that it would — I'd take quite a financial loss. But anyhow, let me
                    finish my story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: We — we arrived — yeah, on a, a, a, a — sorry, I can't remember the name.
                    It wasn't Air France at that time. They had an airline — the French had an
                    airline that did most of the travel in Africa. Oh yes, UTA, it was, Union de
                    Transports A�riens, UTA. We arrived on a UTA flight and the Guineans had rolled
                    up the red carpet to the front door where first class passengers deplaned. They
                    had the honor guard all lined up. And Soapy and the rest of us came out the back
                    door with the economy class passengers requiring that the Guineans scramble to
                    move the red carpet and the honor guard from the front to the back of the
                    plane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I'll never forget it, it was really something out of a movie comedy. That
                    was Soapy. And wherever he arrived, one of the first things that he did was to
                    encourage the embassy staff to bring on all of the local African vendors selling
                    African handicrafts and tribal art. And he would just buy them up by — well, you
                    know, money was no object — he never bargained. Whatever the first price was, he
                    paid it and he took it. As a result of which, when he retired he had a massive
                    collection of African art which was very formidable that which he gave to the
                    museum of art in Detroit and the collection to this day bears his name. But he
                    was, he was quite a character. He also decided that one of the ways to, to make
                    friends with the African corps of Diplomats in Washington was to give periodic
                    square dances. And that he did. He rented the auditorium of a church in
                    Georgetown, and he'd give these square dances, and the Africans loved them! The
                    press had a ball with Soapy for being so cornball.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: But it worked!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: It worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One quick second I'll be back in full swing. You went over
                        with the UN.</hi>

                <p>HAYNES: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you were — was it the UN that sent you to

                <p>HAYNES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you moved to what, the Ford Foundation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the Ford Foundation? What was that job in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I was assistant to the regional director for West Africa, of their
                    foundation development program. And they were doing work that was very similar
                    to the United Nations Development Program. They were helping, in Nigeria, for
                    example, the Nigerians to draft their constitution. And the Ford Foundation
                    brought over some leading American jurists to help them draft their
                    constitution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would have thought the Nigerians would have been
                        more susceptible to a real constitution than some of the others. Is that
                        true, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: They were. Initially it worked pretty well; but, subsequent governments
                    have been so plagued with corruption that the constitution has become almost
                    irrelevant in Nigeria.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then did you — when you were with Harriman, were you
                        with the State Department or were you sort of seconded from the Ford —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I was seconded from the Ford Foundation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there the debate at that time in the State
                        Department about whether we'd recognize all embassies in all these
                        countries? At one point we sent Lloyd Henderson on a tour of the area. I'm
                        not sure whether this was maybe under Eisenhower.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: No. By this time, the decision had been made that each of these
                    independent countries was to have an American embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Some of the embassies we put up to begin with were
                        really sort of storefronts. I mean it took a while to develop sort of an
                        embassy infrastructure in the area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, it happened pretty rapidly. Because of Land-Lease, we were able to
                    acquire some magnificent pieces of property in the former French colonies and
                    British colonies for American embassy residences. They were really quite grand.
                    And I know when I — I'm jumping way ahead, but when I was ambassador in Algeria,
                    the American embassy residence in Algeria is really a, a magnificent Moorish
                    style palace dating back to the mid-19th century. And we acquired that property
                    through Land-Lease moneys that were owed to us by France. That was pretty much
                    the pattern throughout Africa. So in terms of the physical premises, the
                    American embassies were quite grand and were choice pieces of property. In terms
                    of staff and staffing those embassies, it's very interesting, and it's something
                    that I continue to be very upset about with the State Department. There was a
                    very conscious area to staff these embassies at the lower level, not at the
                    ambassadorial level at that time, with African American Foreign Service
                    officers. And that pattern exists to this day. It has been elevated to the point
                    where most of the current and, and recent past American ambassadors to Africa
                    have been African American. This comes from a stupid, misguided belief that “it
                    takes one to know one.” This practice forgets that we African Americans are
                    Americans first, culturally, and know little or nothing first hand about the
                    continent of our ancestral origin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. And I assume that as with somebody of Italian
                        background going to Italy, they're not received, you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>HAYNES: That's right! You're absolutely right. I'll give you an example. In
                    certain parts of Africa, when — well, particularly in Nigeria, it perplexed me
                    how Africans accepted as their own some former British colonial officers who
                    had, as it were, gone native, learned the language, some of them even adopting
                    tribal dress. I was perplexed because they were more warmly received than I was!
                    And it suddenly dawned on me that what I thought was terribly important, and
                    what my fellow Americans thought was very important — that is, the color of
                    one's skin — was not of primary importance to Africans. What was important was
                    the language you spoke, the culture you represented, did you eat like they did,
                    did you dress like they did, did you practice their form of religion. That was
                    far more important to them than the color of one's skin, and it remains true
                    today. I have listened to — I've watched Henry Lewis Gates, the African American
                    scholar from Harvard, I've watched his public broadcasting television shows
                    about Africa. And even he seems to be surprised when he refers to the African
                    leaders that he's interviewing as brother. They look at him with shock, because
                    to them he's not a brother. First of all, he doesn't — he doesn't even look like
                    them! Most of us African Americans are people of mixed race and obviously so to
                    Africans. And by the time they realize you don't speak their language and you
                    don't have — you don't eat their food and you don't have their religion, I mean,
                    brotherhood is something that's, that's not, not in the — or in the forefront of
                    their minds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, we, we —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: By the way, the State Department is still following this pattern. There
                    is a disproportionate number of African American Foreign Service officers and
                    ambassadors serving in Africa and in the Caribbean. I notice this too when we're
                    sending a Chinese American or someone of Chinese American ancestry to China
                    especially when that person does not speak fluent Mandarin. You cannot expect
                    them to have a leg up just because they look Chinese. The department has a lot
                    to learn. For example, there is only one American diplomat who I can recall who
                    has served in a major European nation as an American ambassador, and that's
                    Terence Todman, who was ambassador to Spain and ambassador to —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Denmark.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Denmark, and also to Argentina, an important country. But in this day and
                    age when we have an African American president, we haven't yet got one, not one
                    African American ambassador (and never have had) in Britain, France, Germany,
                    you name it. We did have one in East Germany. David Bolen way back in the
                    Kennedy/Johnson area, as I recall. We had one in Romania. That was O. Rudolph
                    Aggrey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we — well —</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>HAYNES: And of course we had one in Finland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: The former head of —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: USIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: USIA, yeah. The journalist, Carl Rowan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: But I mean in this day and age? Not one African American career Foreign
                    Service Officer or appointee is worthy of serving in France or Germany or
                    England or any other major European post? What about it guys? Get off it. I am
                    very, very upset with the State Department, and I'm very surprised that neither
                    Barack Obama nor Hillary Clinton has been able to do anything about this
                    matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So often the secretaries of state get so — I mean they
                        have so many things on their plate —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: — that the, the personnel going to various posts doesn't
                        rank very high in their priorities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: This — this was brought back — I hate to use the expression. This was
                    brought back in spades to Dean Rusk, when he was secretary of state, and his
                    daughter married an African American classmate pf hers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And I'll never forget, the ambassador from South Africa apparently made
                    some private remarks that were pretty disparaging about this inter-racial
                    marriage. And Rusk met with him privately and dressed him down and told him,
                    first of all, it was none of his business and second of all, we didn't follow
                    the same apartheid policies that South Africa did. But the State Department has
                    not been a very welcoming place for African Americans to make a career.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I'm sorry, I'm — I'm approaching scrupulously chronologically, but —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I appreciate it and I do want to get your judgment on
                        these policies. With the Ford Foundation, were you concentrated on a
                        particular country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, the foundation had offices all around the developing world. They
                    had an office in Cairo for the Middle East, they had an office in New Delhi for
                    Asia, an office I believe in Buenos Aires for Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now during the Ford Foundation time when you weren't
                        accompanying Harriman, what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I was in charge of the regional administration for West Africa. That was
                    my main function as assistant to the director of the West African Office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself concentrating more on a country or
                        several countries than on others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes, the foundation constantly did more in the English speaking — the
                    former British colonies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find that you were a competitor with the
                        British in this area, or was it cooperative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oddly enough, there was more cooperation with the former colonial powers
                    than there was with USAID, for example. It seemed to be a feeling in USAID that
                    we were poaching on their territory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is bureaucracy in full flower, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: You've got it. You've hit it on the head.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you have any spillover into the French
                        Francophone side of our Ford's interest in West Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Very little in the French side, because — and here it's one of the
                    weaknesses of American education — it was so difficult to get Americans who were
                    able to work in French — in the French language. Very difficult to get an
                    American who even had a working knowledge of French. I'm appalled that as our
                    public education faces the economic crunch in our country, we are cutting back
                    on the teaching of foreign languages, and on sciences and math! But don't get me
                    started on that one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I saw something in the paper today showing that the
                        Board of Regents in New York State is cutting — this year is the last year
                        they'll be giving part of their exam in a foreign language.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: That's outrageous!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, it's criminal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: It's outrageous! We are — it's — it means that we are preparing a
                    generation that will be unable to function globally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And by the way, one of the things — the excuses I hear very frequently
                    is, “Oh well, the rest of the world speaks English.” Yes. But that means they
                    know us better than we know them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. No, no, it's — it's a great fault. And so many — it
                        used to be that as a nation of immigrants people would come into the United
                        States, their kids would speak two languages.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, kids today are made to feel that there is something shameful about
                    being bilingual. And that's encouraged by our English as a second language
                    program, where we dump all of our non-English speaking students into these
                    classes and try to Americanize them in terms of language. They become ashamed of
                    their ability to be bilingual or multilingual. There's something un-American
                    about speaking a foreign language!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think there's some priority being given now to kids come
                        from Arabic backgrounds, but —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: A little bit — too little too late.</p>

                        Africa, the — particularly in the early days, the French were extremely
                        jealous of American influence, and often, you know, they tried to inhibit
                        our, our work there. Did you run across that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes. But, since most of our serious involvement was within English
                    speaking countries, that was not a major impediment to being able to do a
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mm-hmm. When Harriman came back, did you help him make a —

                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, the main thrust was that he stressed the importance of the United
                    States getting involved in the development of the new Africa at an early stage,
                    and not letting it become — not letting the former colonial powers reassert
                    their influence over these emerging countries or the Soviet Union.</p>

                <p>HAYNES: But coming back to my trip with Harriman to the Congo with Lumumba. You
                    will recall that the Americans, there has always been a suspicion — never
                    proven, yet — that we were — our CIA was involved with the demise of Patrice
                    Lumumba. And one of the reasons why we wanted Lumumba out of the way was that he
                    was cozying up to the Soviet Union, realizing that, that this was a way of, of
                    playing his cards in a way to get something from both the Soviet Union and the
                    United States. But he — it's interesting, Lumumba was very, very conscious of
                    the fact that Americans were — the American government was trying to subvert his
                    government. He was very, very suspicious of the activities of the CIA in the
                    Congo at the time. And when — I'll never forget, when Harriman went to his
                    office to speak to him (he was prime minister at the time) about U.S. relations,
                    he ushered us both (I was interpreting) into his bathroom. He would not speak in
                    his formal study because he was suspicious that it was being bugged. And the
                    gist of his conversation was a complaint about the subversive activities of the
                    American government.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, certainly as things developed, whether or not we
                        were — the assassination was part of our operation or not — certainly
                        afterwards, with Mobutu and the CIA, I mean that was a very long-lasting
                        relationship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And, indeed the CIA was actively involved. Larry Devlin — I don't know if

                <p>HAYNES: And he has written a book. And while he denies involvement in the
                    assassination, there's so much firsthand evidence offered of American
                    involvement, CIA involvement in subverting the Lumumba government.</p>

                        Harriman sort of aware of the strong possibility of CIA involvement in all

                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh yes. Oh yes. He much more than I because he had had much more direct
                    contact, professional contact with the CIA than I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this considered a bad thing or not by you all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: It was considered a major nuisance, a major impediment to the development

                        problem that faced the Western world and the — as opposed to the Soviet

                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, the Congo was an important area, but it was not the major area.
                    Remember, at that time there were two Germanys, East and West Germany. The wall
                    was constructed dividing Berlin. Oh no, there were other — other major
                    problems.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh no, no, no. The Harriman — the Harriman trip, no, that was a major
                    problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Nigeria? Had there been a growing divide
                        between the Muslim and the sort of Christian anonymous side or was that seen
                        to be working well?</hi>

                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Initially that was working well. The prime minister at the time
                    (subsequently assassinated) was a very distinguished northerner. Tafawa Balewa
                    was his name. And the governor general of Nigeria was Nnamdi Azikiwe, who had
                    been one of the founders of the independence movement in Nigeria. So the reigns
                    of government were very carefully divided to avoid tribal conflict and religious
                    conflict. Such is not the case today. Nigeria's an absolute mess.</p>

                <p>HAYNES: A very major problem, at all levels, of government, commerce, society,

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely. OK.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>All right, today is the 10th of June, 2011 and an interview with Rick Haynes. All
                    right. We're — sort of what happened '63, Harriman and then you moved over. What
                    were you up to?</p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, in 1963 — let me think now. I was working with the Ford Foundation
                    in Tunisia. And Averell Harriman called me and suggested that I come to the
                    State Department and — wait — wait, no, that's not right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To put it in some perspective, Kennedy was assassinated in
                        November.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>HAYNES: That's right. Then it was, it was McGeorge Bundy in 1964 who I was — by
                    that time I was a Foreign Service — in those days they had Foreign Service
                    Reserve Officers, Foreign Service officers who did not come in the traditional
                    route. Bundy asked me if I'd be interested in monitoring political affairs in
                    Africa for the National Security Council. And of course it was such a choice
                    assignment that I jumped at it and the opportunity to work with a guy as
                    brilliant as McGeorge Bundy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, well now, you worked there from when to when,
                        to put in perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Let me think now. '64 to '66, I believe. It wasn't quite that long. But
                    anyhow, that was roughly the period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, well before we get the specifics on issues, how
                        was the Security Council constituted at the time? How did it operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, McGeorge Bundy operated the National Security Council like a senior
                    seminar at Harvard. It was an absolutely engaging and brilliant discussion group
                    dealing with all of the major international issues of the day and presided over
                    by Mac Bundy who was not only brilliant, but extremely witty. So staff meetings,
                    the daily staff meetings were an occasion that all of us looked forward to. We
                    were divided into areas of the world and into specialties. The regional areas,
                    for example, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, and so on, and then
                    there were — there was someone who handled defense and military affairs, and
                    another person who handled economic affairs. It was quite an impressive team.
                    Some of the other members of the team who went on to distinguish themselves,
                    were Harold Saunders who became the Assistant Secretary of State for Near
                    Eastern Affairs. And I'm trying to think who else. Ed Hamilton, well he left
                    just about the time that I did and went into private consulting. But he was
                    absolutely brilliant. And it was — it was quite a — it was quite an impressive
                    team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean looking back on it, was it, you know, I mean
                        having this seminar makes — sends up, when you describe it, sends up some
                        warning signals that maybe there's an awful lot of talk and not much
                        produced. Or did — or — au contraire, how would you — how would you —</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Not at all, not at all. Each of us received the daily cable traffic to
                    the State Department in our area of specialty. It was an awful lot to read and
                    digest. And it was very important for us to sift through all of that incredibly
                    important material, concentrate on the major issues and concerns to the United
                    States, issues that affected our national interest. At the end of the day we had
                    to prepare a paragraph on the major issues in our region for the president's
                    night reading. By that time the president was Lyndon Johnson. And you know,
                    filtering everything and collecting it into a single short paragraph was quite a
                    challenge. But it was an enormously valuable discipline for me personally and
                    it's something that has stayed with me for all of my life — the ability to sift
                    through a lot of verbiage and get down to the essential issues that were of
                    interest to our country. And that was a daily exercise. And in my time, I think
                    the major issues in Africa were the Northern Rhodesian (now called Zimbabwe)
                    unilateral declaration of independence and apartheid in South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did we — first place, before we move to Africa,
                        how much was Vietnam dominating this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a growing thing or when you arrived was it already
                        —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: No, no, Vietnam was the major topic of discussion at our morning staff
                    meetings of the National Security Council staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there within this discussion any thought of
                        well, what should we — I mean obviously you had to figure out what you'd do.
                        I mean were there, you might say, interventionists versus let it play itself
                        out or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes, in all of our discussions there was not a hewing to a party line.
                    There were very strong and very carefully articulated differences of opinions.
                    And yes, there was a — there was — I remember very, very well that there was a
                    small group of us who felt that withdrawing from Vietnam was the thing to do;
                    others felt that increasing our military intervention was the right course to
                    take. There were distinct differences of opinions. And Bundy did a fantastic job
                    of mediating those differences and arriving at a synthesized policy conclusion,
                    which he felt comfortable in passing on to the president.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, in Africa, you know, early on, I mean, when
                        Kennedy came in, he and the State Department were extremely concerned with
                        the Congo. You know, there's a book called The Congo Telegrams, or
                        something. But how stood things in the Congo by the time you arrived and how
                        were you seeing the Congo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: The Congo was still in the process of working through the disastrous
                    advent of, of independence. When the Congo got its independence there were only
                    13 Congolese university graduates in the whole country. And almost all of them
                    were absorbed immediately into the government in one position or another under
                    Lumumba. But also, the Soviets at the time were trying to — trying very hard and
                    somewhat successfully to influence the course of events in the Congo, which
                    resulted in a very significant CIA presence in the Congo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Indeed the — there was, you know, it's never been proven, but there has —
                    have been charges that our own CIA was involved in the assassination of Patrice
                    Lumumba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean you were an African hand by this time. How
                        did you feel about our role in the Congo as you got inside the
                        administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I was quite familiar from the advent of independence in the Congo with
                    the events that were going on. Subsequently, when Soapy Williams was the first
                    Assistant Secretary for African Affairs in the State Department I traveled with
                    him to the Congo several times and sat in on his discussions with Moise Tshombe
                    and others. So I was immersed in Congo affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you feel — from the perspective of the
                        National Security Council, what was happening in the Congo? I mean we were
                        —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I felt, and still feel, that the situation was politically chaotic and
                    totally unpredictable. There were elements involved that we did not understand,
                    such as tribalism, personal vendettas, and a very high level of incompetence
                    when it came to governing the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the country was just too big to — and important to
                        write off, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Exactly. It was such an important source of precious medals and, and also
                    all of the other emerging nations of Africa were watching what was going on in
                    the Congo, and either learning good lessons from them, or learning lessons from
                    them that were not in our national interest. The major lesson being how to play
                    off the Soviet Union against the United States. All it took was an announced
                    flirtation with the Soviet Union to excite the interest and involvement of the

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you feel that there was much to be gained in
                        most — I mean was it UN votes or keeping the math and turning red in Africa
                        or were you sort of picking on key areas that we had to hold on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: It was all of those things. And you mustn't forget that at that time one
                    of our major headaches was the apartheid government of the Republic of South
                    Africa. At that time apartheid was in its heyday. And there were all sorts of —
                    yes, it was all of the things you mentioned. There were votes at the UN, there
                    were economic and commercial interests in the enormous natural resources of
                    Africa. At the time we were only beginning to get a sense of the enormous
                    resources of oil in certain parts of Africa. So we had commercial and political
                    interests in what was going on in Africa at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the atmosphere within the National Security
                        Council regarding South Africa, which was, as you say, at — apartheid was in
                        its heyday.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, I'll give you two anecdotes that will help you to understand the,
                    the climate on the inside of the national government. Dean Rusk was Secretary of
                    State at the time and his daughter, while he was secretary of state, married an
                    African American. The South African — some South African politicians that
                    apparently made some nasty comments about that in the press and Dean Rusk was of
                    course enraged and it immediately cooled his professional and personal relations
                    with the South African ambassador to the United States. And, at the time I was
                    the first desk officer for Southwest Africa which is now Namibia, and the
                    British High Commission territories, now Lesotho, Swaziland, and Botswana. I was
                    scheduled to make a routine visit to the territories under my supervision at the
                    department. And the South African government, learning that I was an African
                    American, refused to grant me a visa to transit South Africa to get to these
                    territories for which I was responsible. And they absolutely refused to allow me
                    to visit Southwest Africa, which was under their jurisdiction as a result of a
                    League of Nations mandate. When Lyndon Johnson heard that I'd been denied a
                    visa, he made it clear to the South African ambassador to the United States that
                    unless I did get a visa to visit my territories, he would arbitrarily declare
                    several of their embassy personnel persona non grata in the United States. And
                    of course they caved, but they caved only in part and gave me a visa to visit
                    the High Commission territories, but did not allow me to visit Southwest Africa.
                    However, they were not allowing any American diplomats to visit Southwest Africa
                    at that time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression when you went to these places?
                        Were they all on the brink of becoming — or have they become independent at
                        that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: No, no, no. They were on the brink of becoming independent. And the
                    poorest and the most dependent on South Africa as a lifeline were Lesotho and
                    Swaziland. The most promising, and, indeed, it has proven to be one of the most
                    promising independent nations of Africa was what was called Bechuanaland, now
                    it's called Botswana. And that was led by a remarkable tribal leader, Seretse
                    Khama, who was married — and this of course upset the South Africans, very much
                    — he was married to a white English lady, Ruth Khama. And Botswana is an
                    enormously wealthy country, thanks to its very vast resources of diamonds and
                    other precious metals. As a result, today it is one of the most politically and
                    economically stable countries in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A relatively small population there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Relatively small population, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well educated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Very well educated. They send a lot — even to this day they send a lot of
                    numbers of the various tribes in Botswana to South Africa as imported labor,
                    mostly in the diamond mines and gold mines. But its, its — today, oddly enough,
                    its president is a son of Seretse Khama, who of course I met — I met him when I
                    visited there. He was just a little boy about five-years-old. I remember him
                    distinctly, because his father, Seretse, was a great jokester in addition to
                    being a very brilliant man. He invited me and my embassy escort officer to have
                    lunch with him at his residence, and to have a meeting with him afterwards.
                    Well, just before the meeting began I asked to be excused to go to the embassy
                    car to get some papers that I had left there and Seretse Khama said to me as I
                    got up to leave, “And by the way, when you get to the garage, watch out for the
                    elephant.” I laughed because I assumed he was teasing me and joking with me as a
                    naive American. But to my horror, when I went around to the garage, what do I
                    see standing there? But two elephants!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I retreated very, very quickly, but he — and he sent a servant with me to
                    reassure me. He said, “These are virtual pets because,” he said, “we feed them
                    rather than to have them destroy our crops. We just give them food and they come
                    every afternoon.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, I was — the joke was on me!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find you were received in these places?
                        Because black African Americans weren't that plentiful in our Diplomatic
                        Service or represented anywhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: But, I was received — generally received with surprise. And I'll give you
                    two anecdotes. When I went to the Congo with Averell Harriman just before
                    Kennedy assumed office, I was driven arounI can't remember how this happened —
                    by a Congolese who was a junior executive in an American oil company in the
                    Congo. In retrospect, I believe that he was one of the CIA contacts in the
                    Congo. And on one of our drives in the capitol city, at that time called
                    Leopoldville, we were at a checkpoint by Congolese soldiers. It was more than a
                    little unnerving for me because one of the soldiers put a gun through the open
                    window on the side where I was sitting. We were in a Volkswagen Beetle. And he
                    said something to the Congolese who was driving me which I could not understand
                    because they were speaking Lingala. And after a heated discussion, we were
                    allowed to pass. And you know, after we passed, I asked my escort, “What was
                    this all about?” He was a little embarrassed and he said, “Well, he, he wanted
                    to know — the soldier wanted to know where I was going with that white man.” And
                    it was a great awakening for me to come to the realization that, to most
                    Africans, looking at African Americans, we are obviously people of mixed
                    race.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And, again, as I said to you earlier in one of my other comments, what
                    endeared Africans to foreigners was not the color of their skin, but how well
                    they spoke the tribal language. In, in some of the former British colonies, some
                    of the former colonial officers, “went native” and adopted African dress,
                    learned to speak the tribal language, ate the food and learned the customs. And
                    they had much greater acceptance by the general African population than did
                    African Americans, who did not have any knowledge of their language and culture
                    and did not even share the color of their skin. So many of us African Americans
                    are people of mixed race that most Africans do not identify with us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, this whole —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Which by the way, if I may finish my thought, which makes the continued
                    pattern of concentrating African American diplomats to posts in Africa
                    absolutely ridiculous.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, I'm — we developed that at another point. Yeah, it
                        is. I mean well, for one thing, this whole skin color racial thing, you
                        know, doesn't make much sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: You know, and particularly in the State Department, we've had two African
                    American Secretaries of State and we now have an African American president, and
                    for God's sake, the practice of racially segregated diplomatic assignments
                    continues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as, you know, it's the political thing to do, and
                        it's almost, you know, a continuation of our own tribalism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: It is our own racism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yep. Well, then moving on to Zimbabwe or Southern
                        Rhodesia. What were we looking at, the problem there? Was white Prime
                        Minister Ian Smith anathema or was it just a problem to be worked out? Did
                        we feel it was going to make a real difference in the rest of Africa and
                        we're using this regime as an example or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: No, he was, he was clearly anathema. He was as much anathema to us as he
                    was to Great Britain. If he was allowed to secede from the British Empire, it
                    made a mockery of the granting of independence to all these former British
                    colonies in Africa. And it would also encourage the racist apartheid regime in
                    South Africa which supported Smith.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we doing regarding Southern Rhodesia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, we did not have an embassy there because it had not yet gotten its
                    independence. So we didn't really have a good listening post. Almost everything
                    we got was filtered through the British.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did we, I mean as a policy, was there much of a
                        policy except hands off or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: No, no, no. It was clearly a policy of opposition to the Ian Smith
                    government and its threat of unilateral declaration of independence. We were in
                    lockstep with the British on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mm-hmm. What about — you covered all of Africa for the
                        National Security Council, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Except for Egypt and North Africa, which were considered the Middle East
                    or the Near East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we doing about the whole Francophone area? Were
                        we sort of marking time or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, our involvement in the Francophone area was much less significant
                    than with the British areas. And this was another weakness of the State
                    Department. We just didn't have enough French speaking Foreign Service officers
                    to monitor and certainly not to staff posts in the first embassies that opened
                    up in Francophone Africa. We were, because of this weakness, incredibly
                    unprepared for very simplistic reasons — language — to monitor affairs. Most of
                    our French speaking Foreign Service officers fluent in French were in France and
                    in Belgium. And of course we were not — and to this day we're not even getting a
                    good pool of such officers because language studies in our secondary schools and
                    in our colleges has in some places actually disappeared. We have this notion
                    that it's not necessary to speak anybody else's language because everybody
                    speaks English. The result is that everybody else in the world knows us better
                    than we know them!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And in many ways the rest of the world manipulates us to our
                    disadvantage. For example, when I was living in Iran, all of the university
                    students in Iran spoke English, dressed like American students, watched our
                    American television, and, as a result, they were much more familiar with us and
                    our culture than we were with them and theirs. And this state of affairs
                    continues to this day. I'm just appalled at the attempt to pass local ordinances
                    and legislation here at home that make English the official language of the
                    United States. And if you can't speak it, then you cannot become a citizen, you
                    can't go to our schools, you can't do a lot of things. What an ethnocentric
                    attitude that is ultimately leading to our undoing as we try to influence the
                    rest of the world. You know, Chinese students come to our universities fluent in
                    English, and we cannot send students to universities in China fluent in Chinese.
                    No. We can't even send them to France fluent in French!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Forgive me, but that's one of my favorite gripes with the practical
                    implementation of American foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, a part we haven't talked about, what about the
                        Horn of Africa? Ethiopia and Somalia during your time? Somalia?</hi>

                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, Ethiopia was the major headache. I'm trying to think when Haile
                    Selassie was overthrown and ultimately assassinated. But there was turmoil going
                    on in Ethiopia, and Ethiopia was the major player in the Horn of Africa. Somalia
                    was just awakening and, oddly enough, even they had trouble communicating with
                    each other because one had been Italian Somaliland and the other had been
                    British Somaliland. And the working languages in each place were English and,
                    and Italian, and they didn't necessarily communicate very well. And, on top of
                    that, you had the tribal equation. Somaliland was, at that time, bumbling along
                    trying to create a kind of national unity which it has never succeeded in
                    creating to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in Ethiopia — this is back in the early '60s — at
                        one point I was the INR (Bureau of Intelligence and Research) person for the
                        Horn of Africa. And our entire policy rested on preserving Kagnew Station,
                        which is a communications and intercept station. How stood it during your
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Quite frankly, I don't recall. I do not recall that as being an issue.
                    Because, as I say, Ethiopia — and by the way, Ethiopia was having internal
                    problems with Eritrea. It had its own internal problems, even during the time of
                    Haile Selassie. But I do not recall Kagnew being a major concern during my

                        almost fall in love with him, particularly the socialists in Europe. He was
                        really driving his country down into sort of economic disaster. But he had a
                        great following in the socialist world. Did we have much to do —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: One of the problems in dealing with Tanzania and Mozambique in the State
                    Department, at the time I was there as a Foreign Service officer and later as a
                    staff member of the National Security Council, was one particular individual who
                    was a good friend of mine. However, I often questioned his judgment. That was
                    the deputy assistant secretary for African Affairs under Soapy Williams, a man
                    named Wayne Fredericks. Do you remember him?</p>

                <p>HAYNES: Wayne had a love affair with, with — what's his face?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nyerere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes. Julius Nyerere, and with Eduardo Mondlane in Mozambique. Mondlane
                    was married to a white American lady, Janet Rae Johnson.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Wayne would often refer to Nyerere by his first name, Julius, as if they were
                    intimate friends. In Wayne's mind Julius could do no wrong. The rest of us
                    realized that Nyerere was a very academic socialist with no practical experience
                    who was ultimately setting policies for his country that were leading it if not
                    to disaster, was certainly not exploiting its potential for prosperity.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, in many ways the London School of Economics and

                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: You're absolutely right. They were text book socialists with no practical
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Angola and Mozambique? The Portuguese, were
                        they just sort of off the radar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: They were — they were pretty much off the radar because they played their
                    cards very close to their chest. While not in as bad shape as the Belgian Congo,
                    there were not very many educated Africans in, in either country. Those leaders
                    who emerged had their education in other places, some of it in the Soviet Union,
                    which set up — I believe it was even called Lumumba University — a special
                    university for Africans in Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it was Lumumba University.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: — to educate potential African leaders. So what emerged from Lumumba
                    University was certainly not something that served our national interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well I'm told that many of them — I was in Yugoslavia
                        at the time and I was getting, you know, Africans who were coming out of
                        Bulgaria at that point. But they were sort of reflecting the same treatment
                        they were getting in the Soviet Union, and that was intense racism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so they did not come out of Lumumba or satellites with
                        any great love for the Soviet Union or its way of doing things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: No, they did not — there was no love lost for the Soviet Union. But you
                    know, the only form of government that they had been taught was in the Soviet
                    pattern. They didn't have very much to fall back on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. Well, with the NSC (National Security Council), did
                        you see both Kennedy and Johnson there dealing with the NSC? Was it
                        different or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I was not there — I was not in the NSC during Kennedy's presidency. I was
                    only there when Johnson was president. So I can't compare them. But Johnson —
                    and this is a very personal opinion and I underline “opinion” — I had the
                    feeling that Johnson did not particularly like McGeorge Bundy. First of all,
                    because he was a Kennedy carryover.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Second of all, he was from the educated New England elite. And third of
                    all, because Bundy was a lot smarter than Johnson, and Johnson knew it. Bundy
                    was a lot more worldly and quicker on his feet and he handled language
                    brilliantly where Johnson would very often stumble. No, there was not much love
                    lost between them. I think Johnson respected Bundy in a funny sort of way. After
                    Bundy resigned, Johnson had closer relationships with Walt Rostow, who succeeded
                    Bundy. And I attended meetings between Rostow and Johnson. And I could tell that
                    there was a mutual respect. There was a warmth there that obviously did not
                    exist during the Bundy years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how long were you with the NSC? I mean when did you
                        leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I left in 1966.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One further question talking about you might say American
                        tribalism. Did you find, I mean there was a lot of civil rights activity
                        going on in this period. Did you get involved in any of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes. Not when I was on the National Security Council staff, but when I
                    was in the State Department and my vacation came up and I went to Soapy Williams
                    and I told him that my then wife and I planned to go to Mississippi to teach in
                    a freedom school as part of the Civil Rights Movement for the two weeks of my
                    vacation. And I asked him whether he thought that would be an embarrassment to
                    the department. And, without hesitation, he said, “Not at all.” And, so I did.
                    My wife and I spent two weeks teaching at a freedom school at the height of the
                    Civil Rights movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you teach?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: In Tougaloo, Mississippi. And it was quite a — we were not welcomed there
                    by the white population. We stayed on the Tougaloo College campus, Tougaloo
                    being a segregated black college. And every night the Ku Klux Klan would circle
                    the campus in all their regalia with their horns blowing to let us know that
                    they were watching us. It was unnerving, to say the least. But we took courage
                    from the black people that we were involved with who were so eager for education
                    that in many cases they were risking their lives and the lives of their children
                    to send them to the freedom schools. And what we were doing was just teaching —
                    we were not indoctrinating them. We were just teaching them basic primary and
                    secondary school educational skills.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you the only African American on the NSC at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that position, were you sort of the house
                        black or I mean were you turned to, you know, when — I mean obviously there
                        were so many things happening in the Civil Rights thing that I would think
                        you'd almost become a point person for, “Well, what do you think of this,
                        Rick?” or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: We were not — we were not dealing with issues of American Civil Rights,
                    so you know, that never came up in any of the discussions. We were limited to
                    foreign policy and I did, for example, go to state dinners with my wife whenever
                    Lyndon Johnson entertained an African chief of state. However, I never had the
                    feeling that I was “on view” because of my race. I thought it was because of my
                    assignment. I'm trying to think now — state dinners — no, I didn't feel as
                    though I was the black man in the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about President Johnson? Did you get any feel about
                        how he operated or dealt, particularly with foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>HAYNES: I had the feeling that he was — he did not feel comfortable dealing with
                    foreign affairs, as comfortable as he did dealing with domestic affairs. I got
                    that feeling because of the deference that he showed to Walt Rostow. I'm trying
                    to think — oh, the one thing — Johnson was a man who used a lot of four-letter
                    words and, who didn't mince his words. His language was not the language of
                    diplomacy. And I will never forget once walking in the basement of the White
                    House in the corridor leading between the East Wing and the West Wing walking by
                    Johnson and Bill Moyers. And what I heard rocked me back on my heels. As they
                    passed I heard Johnson say, “And I don't want my daughter going out with that
                    nigger any more.” Well, I nearly dropped dead in my tracks, but I kept walking.
                    And it dawned on me that he was talking about Lynda Bird Johnson who was dating
                    the Hollywood actor, George Hamilton, at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: George Hamilton is referred to as the guy with the perpetual tan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes (laughs).</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, he's got that perpetual tan, we in the African American community
                    maintain, because he is a descendant of the Hamilton family of Atlanta, Georgia
                    who are descendants of Alexander Hamilton, a West Indian Creole. Alexander
                    Hamilton was born on the island of Nevis in the Caribbean and worked as an
                    accountant in St. Croix which was a British possession at the time. He then came
                    to the United States and became our first secretary of the treasury. It is
                    widely believed in the African American community that the duel that he fought
                    with Aaron Burr was over Hamilton's mixed race.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, George Hamilton was one of his descendants. I happen to know the Hamilton
                    family in Atlanta, Georgia, and they are very fair-skinned black people to this
                    day. So, it is very possible that George Hamilton is in fact of mixed race
                    ancestry and that's the reason why he can't lose his tan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. And well, I mean, one has this thing — I think isn't
                        it in Louisiana where they have this exquisite definition of who is what,
                        quadroon and octoroon?</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really — it really is. And yet, somebody like Lyndon
                        Johnson sort of grew up in that culture.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Right.</p>
                <p>

                </p>

                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: He was. From a distance, I would call him a study in contrast. I'll never
                    forget at the — I'm trying to — he gave a state dinner for the Mwami of Burundi
                    (the tribal king). In any case, Johnson made it very pointed to ask my wife to
                    dance with him. Well, I wasn't quite sure whether he was making a racial
                    statement or because he thought my wife was attractive. Because he also had an
                    eye for pretty ladies.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: OK, listen, always good to talk to you.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, we do. And oh, by the way, before I forget, I was talking to my good
                    friend Terence Todman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah-ha.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And Terry said that he, he knew you and that he — well, Terry's the only
                    black American diplomat who's really made it into the big league
                    ambassadorially, having served as ambassador to Spain, Denmark and Argentina.
                    But he mentioned to me that there is a CD compiling all of the interviews that

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, we had a CD. But now — that had about 900
                        transcripts. But now if you just Google Frontline, one word Frontline,
                        another word Diplomacy, that will take you to the Library of Congress where
                        there are 1600 of our transcripts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Wow. Wow.</p>

                <p>HAYNES: Diplomacy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a Library of Congress website, but it brings you into
                        our collection.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Thank you so much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Here we go. Today is the 21st of June, the
                        first day of summer, 2011 with Rick Haynes. And Rick, we'd left — you had —
                        you had left the Johnson White House when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: In — let me think now — 1966. I think it was June of 1966.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, well you went to a — a headhunter firm or
                        something or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes, I joined the — at that time the nation's top executive recruitment
                    firm called Spencer Stuart and Associates in New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were these Spencer Stuart?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Spencer Stuart was the name of the founder of the firm, and he had a team
                    at that time of about six or eight recruiters in offices, main office in New
                    York, secondary office in Chicago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, what was, what was — first place, how long did you
                        work for them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Whew. Let's — easily five years. And then I joined one of their clients,
                    the Cummins Engine Company located in Columbus, Indiana. And I had worked for
                    that client for a couple of years recruiting for them. So, their chairman, J.
                    Irwin Miller, asked me to join Cummins as a vice president — as the vice
                    president for management, development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, well let's go back to your time with Spencer
                        Stuart. What were you actually doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I was primarily focusing — it was shortly after the passage of the Civil
                    Rights Act of 1964. And major corporations were all concerned about being in
                    compliance with that act and were trying their best to recruit minority group
                    members for management positions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So where did you — how'd you find the field for — that you
                        were working on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, the field was a very rich field. There were far more qualified
                    minority group individuals, men and women, for management positions than there
                    were positions open.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you focus on any particular place? Or how did
                        you go about getting recruits?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, I started with my own address book, people that I knew personally
                    who were in management positions in government, in not-for-profit organizations,
                    or in junior executive positions in business.</p>
                <p>At the same time I had started teaching as an adjunct professor at the Harvard
                    Business School. And of course among my minority group students, there were
                    quite a number of individuals who were qualified to be recruited as junior
                    executives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, at that time, and maybe — and please correct me if
                        I'm wrong — when we talk about minorities, we're really talking about
                        African Americans, more than — I mean it always — at least when you see the
                        figures, sort of the, the Latinos seem to be, or the Hispanic Americans seem
                        to fall through the cracks. Although now of course they're the majority of
                        the minority.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, at that time it was primarily African Americans and Asian
                    Americans, and primarily men. It was before the Women's Liberation Movement
                    gathered any momentum.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find sort of the making of minority candidates
                        with these firms, which really weren't used to this? I mean this was, you
                        know, this was a new game in town and I would think there'd be a lot of
                        difficulty adjusting to it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: There was much less difficulty than you would have imagined because,
                    particularly in the world of business, the corporations, the business people
                    were much more concerned about the ability of job candidates to perform on the
                    job, and much less concerned about the color of their skin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the people who were coming up? I mean
                        could you follow through to find out how they did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh yes. Several of them reached the top of the corporate world. For
                    example, one of them, Kenneth Chenault, is the chairman of American Express.
                    Let's see, who else? Clifton Wharton became the chairman of TIAA-CREF (Teachers
                    Insurance and Annuity Association - College Retirement Equities Fund). The
                    present CEO of Xerox, Ursula Burns, is a black female. Like them, several of the
                    people that I recruited early on have risen to the top.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find yourself concentrating on one sort of
                        graduates of particular schools or was it a blanket looking around? How did
                        you go about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: It was very important that the white executives consider that the
                    minority executives were their professional equals. And, therefore, yes, I went
                    to the same schools that the majority of the white executives came from:
                    Harvard, Stanford, Georgetown, Wharton, places like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there sort of a small group of women who were, you
                        know, should have been executives? I mean was there much in the way of
                        graduates of these business schools in the way of black women?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: In the mid 1960s there was a surge in the efforts of the best colleges
                    and universities — the business schools, schools of medicine, schools of law —
                    to recruit minority groups and women. Very unlike the time that I was at law
                    school at Yale back in the 1950s when in my class at the Yale Law School there
                    were only three black students. And two of them dropped out, so I was the only
                    black who graduated in my class. That was not unusual at that time. But, by the
                    time we got into the mid '60s after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
                    the major professional schools and particularly the business schools had made an
                    effort to increase their minority group enrollment.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about the Hispanic and the Asian groups? I
                        would have — the Asians I think would have sort of been a — really a
                        different breed of cat, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, not just because they were Asian, but because they were in most
                    cases either immigrants to this country, or the children of immigrants. And
                    regardless of the national origin, immigrants I have found have a great deal of
                    faith in higher education as the routes to make it in our country. So for
                    Asians, they — they have for years been excelling in graduate schools and they
                    just continued on their own without much focus on them to excel and to enroll in
                    our colleges and universities in numbers out of proportion to their actual
                    numbers in the population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, had they been discriminated against by the major
                        corporations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh yes. Anything that wasn't white had been dis — and I might add, white
                    Anglo-Saxon Protestant, because Jews were also discriminated against in
                    business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, do Jews fall under the — sort of the minority
                        awareness and trying to do something about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, the Jews came to the challenge of equality of opportunity in this
                    country with a different mindset, and with a different background. They — most
                    of them had come from Europe, many of them had already come from families that
                    were in business, and they were also very dedicated to higher education. And
                    where the leading professional schools in our country might have discriminated
                    against them, they set up their own schools. Yeshiva University is a case in
                    point. They set up their own banks, investment firms like the Lehman Brothers
                    and Goldman Sachs. They were a very self-reliant and I say this in the best
                    sense of the word, aggressive minority group in creating opportunities for
                    themselves wherever the opportunities didn't exist. For example, look at how
                    many Jewish hospitals there are in this country to this day. No longer
                    predominantly Jewish, but still with the title. They were originally created
                    because Jewish doctors were not allowed to practice in white Anglo-Saxon
                    Protestant hospitals, so they created their own. And they are excellent
                    hospitals to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about — Hispanics sort of seem to be — fall of the
                        edge of the table or something when these — but at the time you were
                        looking, in the early '70s, late '60s, early '70s, how did — how did you
                        find the Hispanic factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, the pool from which I had to select candidates for my clients did
                    not include many Hispanics. The Hispanics that were emigrating to the United
                    States at that time did not have the wealth of higher educational background
                    that even blacks had at that time. And the same is true to a sad extent
                    today.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, it's sort of a problem that is still floating around
                        of getting the — so many Hispanics engage, we might say the American system,
                        which is higher education and, and property owning and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, it's a two-pronged challenge or two-pronged problem. One, is they
                    don't come from traditions in their own countries in the Hispanic world, in the
                    Latin American world, where higher education is accessible to them. And two,
                    there are no institutions in our country that are making any concerted efforts
                    to encourage Hispanics to acquire higher education. So, both the lack of a
                    cultural tradition, unlike Europeans emigrated to our country, the lack of a
                    cultural tradition and the lack of a — how should I say — a concerted effort in
                    our country to help them move up the ladder, the socioeconomic ladder. This has
                    been a major deterrent to getting Hispanics into executive positions in
                    business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The one exception seems to be — this is from an outsider,
                        you're down there — but sort of the Cuban Americans who already come from a
                        business culture in Cuba.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q; You know, they were business people before and they're business people
                    now.</p>
                <p>HAYNES: They were well educated and they have become an economically powerful and
                    politically powerful minority here in the U.S. Most Cubans do not come from a
                    privileged background, but those who do have made enormous strides, mostly in
                    setting up their own business, not into moving into the mainstream of American
                    corporate life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, after this approximately five years you moved to —
                        where did you go now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Let me think now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your engine company.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes, the Cummins, C-U-M-M-I-N-S, Cummins Engine Company, which the
                    world's largest independent manufacturer of diesel engines with plants all over
                    the world, in Asia, Europe, Latin America, as well as here in the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whom do they — do they sell engines to the major firms
                        like Volvo and others or?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, yes. They sell engines to Komatsu, the Japanese truck
                    manufacturers, to International Harvester, to the major American truck
                    manufacturers, and they also sell engines for generator sets to companies
                    supplying oil companies for their oil rigs. They sell marine engines for ships.
                    So wherever the diesel engine can be used the Cummins Engine Company has a
                    market.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now where did you live?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I lived then in Columbus, Indiana. Ultimately I became vice president for
                    the Mideast and Africa, and I was based in Tehran, Iran, just before the fall of
                    the Shah. My family and I lived in Tehran for two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to that, how did you find settling in as an
                        executive in Indiana? Certainly at least southern Indiana has a reputation
                        of being a very sort of southern state.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: It's the unregenerate south. I remember, when I brought my children back
                    from Iran, taking them downtown in Columbus, Indiana to watch the Ku Klux Klan
                    march down the main street. So ours was a life of contrast. You learned very
                    quickly that there were certain communities that were hostile to blacks. For
                    example, while we were living there in the early 1970s, some bigoted whites
                    boarded up a house where a black man was living with a white woman and set fire
                    to the house in neighboring Seymour, Indiana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ugh!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And I had always been told that the Klan was founded in southern
                    Indiana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe that's correct. When I think of Indiana and I
                        think of the south, I think during the — particularly during the '20s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Indiana was sort of the centerpiece, not, not the Gary,
                        Indiana, and all that, but down south.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean it's sort of odd that it's not — it seems
                        Midwestern, but it really isn't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Southern Indiana is more like Kentucky which it neighbors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, okay, now how did you find being a black man in that
                        area, but being in a high executive position? I mean were there country
                        clubs? How did this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: There were several of us blacks in the company in executive positions all
                    because the chairman of the board, J. Irwin Miller who was liberal, although
                    politically a Republican. He set out to create what was referred to as an “oasis
                    in the prairie” to set an example to communities all around. And, as the most
                    powerful citizen of the area in and around Columbus, Indiana, he influenced and
                    made life comfortable for those of us who were not white.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I mean we had no — we had no problem buying homes, living in
                    neighborhoods with white neighbors, sending our children to schools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I speak as someone who doesn't come from that culture, but
                        so much of corporate life seems to center around the country club. How did
                        that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: When the company owns the country club —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughs) Okay (laughs). That kind of — that —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: That's a simple solution to what might have been a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. How about school for the kids?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: We sent our children to private school for elementary school and to
                    parochial school — Catholic elementary and middle school. Because, as you may
                    recall, the Catholic Church at the time was in the forefront of integrating
                    education, much to the dismay of many of the non-Catholics around. But Catholics
                    in the Midwest had been the victims of prejudice because of their religion, and
                    I think that may have been one of the things that encouraged the Catholic church
                    in the Midwest to take a very progressive and racially integrated approach to
                    education.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about just — not really on the racial side — but
                        how did you find the culture of the engine company? I mean, you know, this
                        is not the sort of thing you've been dealing — it's a different world, isn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: It is very much a different world. But remember, this was a major Fortune
                    500, multinational company. So, in every one of my executive positions with the
                    company, I was traveling around the world and did not feel what might otherwise
                    have been the culturally stifling environment of a small Midwestern town. And
                    ultimately, I was posted abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well let's talk about — you were in Tehran from when
                        to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Let me think now. '75 to '77, just before the Shah was overthrown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you went out there, were you getting any
                        premonitions of impending doom or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Not initially. However, over a very short period of time it became
                    abundantly clear within months of my arrival in Tehran, the Shah was in trouble.
                    There were some indicators. For example, the Shah never went anywhere in his own
                    capitol in an automobile. He always went from place-to-place in a helicopter.
                    There were always three helicopters on the landing pad when he approached, and
                    it was only at the last moment that he decided which one he would take. So
                    nobody but the Shah himself knew in which one of the three helicopters he was
                    when all three helicopters took off. Also when we first got there it was
                    abundantly clear that it was not safe to be critical, even in private
                    conversation, of the Shah. And certainly not even critical before your own
                    household servants. But, in a short period of time, suddenly there were a
                    profusion of jokes about the Shah and how stupid he was and how shaky he was on
                    the throne — something that I never heard when I first arrived. And these were
                    just minor indicators, minor but important indicators of, of how uneasy he was
                    on the “Peacock Throne” of Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you have any concern about the huge presence of
                        American technicians and all in the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>HAYNES: A lot of concern. For example, while we were there, shortly after we
                    arrived, there were three American executives from North American Rockwell
                    Company that supplied military planes to the Iranian Air Force, who were
                    ambushed on their way to work and assassinated. As a result, whenever I went
                    from my home to my office I chose different times of day and different routes.
                    And, in this connection, I had a driver, a chauffeur, who drove me to work and
                    drove my children to school and who actually lived in our compound. The very day
                    that these North American Rockwell executives were assassinated, he didn't show
                    up for work. And he never showed up for work thereafter, never even coming to
                    collect his wages. And that made me very uneasy, I can tell you, because while I
                    couldn't prove it, I had to think that there was more than just casual
                    significance to his failure to turn up for work the day these men were
                    killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Boy. Did you have much contact with the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes. I belonged to a group of American businessmen in Tehran who tried
                    unsuccessfully on several occasions to meet with Richard Helms who was the
                    ambassador at the time to tell him of our concerns for the deteriorating
                    security situation that we were seeing in the capitol. But Ambassador Helms
                    refused to see us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean that seems — yeah, normally an ambassador has close
                        ties with the business community — American business community. That's part
                        of his job. I mean this is not —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: But unfortunately, a whole succession of American ambassadors had closer
                    ties to the Shah and his cohorts than to the American business community. As a
                    result, the American Embassy in Tehran ultimately ended up having a vested
                    interest in perpetuating the myth that the Shah was not in trouble. It's not
                    unusual sometimes for an ambassador — unfortunately — to become so enamored with
                    his host government that he is uncritical.</p>
                <p>Q: Yeah, well there's a story going around — you probably heard it too — about
                    one of our ambassadors, political appointee to Morocco, who referred to the king
                    as “our king,” you know. . HAYNES: I've heard that. Also a similar story about a
                    couple of our ambassadors in Saudi Arabia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. I mean this is of course “localities” gone mad, but
                        the — I mean later you were in a — as an ambassador you could understand, I
                        guess your ruler — who was the ruler when you were there in Algeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Houari Boumedi�ne.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He wasn't a very lovable person, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>HAYNES: No, he was pretty much a dictator. Algeria was, when I was there, and
                    still remains to this day, a totalitarian state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we'll come — obviously come back to that. What was
                        life like in Tehran when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: It was unbelievably social. It was as if Iranians and the expatriate
                    community knew that the end of the Shah's rule was eminent and, my God, the
                    dinner parties, the socializing, the women — I saw Iranian women who love
                    jewelry, taking their jewels out of their bank vaults and wearing them at these
                    dinner parties. It was breathtaking. You've never seen such socializing. And of
                    course at the same time, a lot of the very wealthy Iranians were, were sending
                    their money, and these women were taking their jewels, out of their country.
                    Many of them went to the South of France, and a lot of them came to the Los
                    Angeles area. To the point where today Los Angeles is referred to by Iranians as
                    “Tehrangeles”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh my God, yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: There are so many wealthy Iranians currently living in, in Los Angeles,
                    all of whom made their wealth during the time of the Shah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, did your company employ many Iranians in
                        Iran?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, I was there as it — not because we employed that many. I was there
                    in Iran because it was a convenient base from which to communicate with the Arab
                    world and Africa. At the time, Lebanon was in upheaval. Actually, I was supposed
                    to set up an office in Beirut, but there was so much strife going on in Beirut
                    that we changed our plan and moved the office to Tehran. But it wasn't that we
                    had so many employees there. It was that the Iranian market was such an
                    important one for us, both military and commercial. Just before I arrived we had
                    sold 4,500 Cummins engines to Iran in International Harvester trucks. And that
                    of course meant that we had considerable commercial interests in Iran that the
                    company was interested in preserving and protecting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Arab world did you have ties to Iraq, or was that a
                        Soviet satellite?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: We didn't do that much business with Iraq. We did a huge amount of
                    business in Saudi Arabia, where we had a major Saudi distributor. And in Beirut
                    — in Lebanon also. Trying to think where else. And that was — that was a major
                    —</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How'd you deal with Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, the Arab nations, not Iran, but the Arab nations had a boycott of
                    companies that dealt with Israel. And even though we continued to deal with
                    Israel, because of the importance of our businesses to their commercial
                    development, the Arab nations never enforced that boycott. It was a selective
                    boycott, as they often tend to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, I know. How'd you find dealing with Saudi Arabia? I
                        know they all require a partnership or a sponsor or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh yes. At that time, I couldn't even visit Saudi Arabia on business
                    without being invited by one of our Saudi business collaborators. I had to have
                    an invitation from a Saudi. Just couldn't go there for tourism or, you know,
                    casually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mm-hmm. Well —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: IT was a very closed society as it remains today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find doing business there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: It's very different from doing business in the United States, because —
                    and this is true of most of the rest of the non Anglo-Saxon world. Time is
                    precious for us Americans and Anglo-Saxons. We come, we have business to do, we
                    do it in a certain period of time, and we get out. That's not true in the Middle
                    East. To this day, you go, you spend days drinking coffee and chatting about
                    nothing of relevance to what you brought you there. And they take the lead in
                    the discussion. You don't determine when to start talking business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. There's the old —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Difficult to get — and this of course created problems back home where
                    majority of the people you were dealing with back at your headquarters in the
                    United States, particularly in Columbus, Indiana, didn't understand why it took
                    so much time to conduct business in the Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Why can't you get these people to agree to something that's in their
                    interest? It doesn't work that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: By the way, the conduct of foreign policy is very much conducted in the
                    same cultural manner from their point of view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did, did you have much business in other parts of —
                        well, I mean, how about Egypt at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes. Egypt was less important. But yes, we had a distributor in Egypt. We
                    had distributors in the United Arab Emirates, in Oman. All of these were
                    countries that I visited during that time in, in the conduct of the company's
                    business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you doing business in sort of Sub-Sahara Africa
                        too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes, very much so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now how was that going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, it was, it was growing rapidly. We had distributors in Senegal, in
                    the Ivory Coast, in Ghana, Nigeria, Gabon, Angola, South Africa and Kenya. That
                    was a very interesting diplomatic challenge too, because at that time Angola was
                    very much in the Soviet camp. I traveled to all of these places during my time
                    in charge of that region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you have programs of training mechanics or was
                        it unnecessary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: We helped our distributors develop local training programs. It was very
                    important that we maintain the quality of our engines by having trained
                    mechanics on the spot. And that was also a cultural challenge particularly in
                    the oil rich countries of the Middle East. When something broke down the Arabs
                    just threw it away. They didn't repair it. They bought a new one. And that's
                    what they did that with their own automobiles. As you drive through Saudi Arabia
                    you could see very expensive cars abandoned in the desert, some of them only had
                    a flat tire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well —</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Part of the job was to inculcate in our customers the importance of
                    preventive maintenance of the engine and of timely repair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would think also, I mean, you know, part of our
                        whole system here in the United States is when you get something there's a
                        supply of spare parts. You know, if your car goes down, they'll pull up a
                        Chevy gear or something like that. You know, these are all pretty much
                        available.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes. The sale of spare parts was a very important part of our
                    business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think you'd have all sorts of problems with
                        customs and that sort of thing. I mean everybody's hand is out for a
                        bribe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, it depends on who you're dealing with. If you're dealing with the
                    government, no problem with customs. If you're dealing with a very powerful, a
                    local businessman, no problem with the customs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course I would think with a Cummins engine that you
                        would be — it would be sort of a wide open market for these, because there's
                        so much need for generation of power and all, all over the place, because
                        there's —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh no. No, we had competitors. Caterpillar was a competitor. We had
                    Japanese competitors, Chinese competitors. It wasn't a captive market for
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the French? The French were always difficult in
                        business or politics and how did you — were they in the market?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Much less — from the point of diesel engines, much less than the
                    Americans. But the major difficulty with the French was not — was not on their
                    side, and I'm coming back to something I've touched on before, the enormous
                    inability of American businessmen to deal in a foreign language, even one as
                    popular as French. That puts us at a distinct disadvantage in doing business
                    with countries where the working language is French. And in much of Africa that
                    is the working language. But you know, we've got to go back to deal with a basic
                    and fundamental problem in our public education system where the study of
                    foreign languages is disappearing. It's incredible that in this day and age,
                    when the need is greater than ever before, the availability of foreign language
                    instruction is shrinking in our country.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. You left in what, '78, just before the Shah
                        left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I left in '77.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '77. Was there a really feeling of relief? Were you
                        getting out because of the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes, the situation was so critical and dire that I didn't ask the company
                    for permission to come home with my family; I told them that we were evacuating
                    on a certain date and shutting down the office. And we did so several months
                    before the overthrow of the Shah, and were able to get out intact unlike many
                    expatriate Americans who waited much too late.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you just plain shut down your business or were you
                        dealing with it from outside?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, our distributor was still there. So, yes, in effect, we were
                    dealing with it from outside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your distributor fair?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, he ultimately had to shut down and flee the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to all the Cummins engines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I have no idea. But I suspect that they're all sitting in a graveyard
                    somewhere. I don't know whose engines the Iranians are using for their trucks in
                    their oil industry. But, they're not using Cummins engines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you came back in '77 what'd you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, I hadn't been back more than a couple of weeks when I had a call
                    from the White House asking me if I would be interested in an ambassadorial
                    appointment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, had you been keeping up your political ties?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Keeping up? I had many friends in the State Department, going back to my
                    early days, and I had one benefactor who remembered me well, and that was W.
                    Averell Harriman. He was no slouch when it came to pushing his secretary of
                    state or his president. He was very much the respected elder statesman. And he
                    was the one who recommended me for the post of ambassador to Algeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, this is during the early Carter administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Very early Carter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you ever had any contact with Carter before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: None. And I never had contact with him face-to-face until after he left
                    the presidency and after I had ceased to be an ambassador. Carter, you may
                    recall, dispensed with the practice of meeting his ambassadors before they took
                    up their overseas posts. It was regrettable, because those meetings produced, if
                    nothing else, a photograph of the ambassador shaking hands with his president,
                    which was a very impressive item in the ambassador's office when foreign
                    visitors came.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: But, Carter — just as he dispensed with meeting his ambassadors — did not
                    serve liquor at state dinners or at any official function in the White House. He
                    was a strange duck.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Algeria come bubbling out of the thing? Did you
                        ever find out how that worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: President Carter had set up a committee of elder statesmen to make
                    ambassadorial recommendations for political ambassadorial appointees to him. And
                    this is because he had no background in foreign affairs, and no direct personal
                    contacts with anyone in foreign affairs. Remember, he'd only been governor of
                    Georgia. So he was pretty dependent on this committee to make ambassadorial
                    suggestions to him, most of which he followed. Also, Algeria at that time was
                    supplying 10% of the United States' imported crude oil. A significant
                    amount.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>HAYNES: And also, the Algerian government had broken diplomatic relations with
                    the United States over, if memory serves me U.S. support for Israel in the Six
                    Day War. So we had not had an ambassador there for a long time. I believe the
                    last ambassador prior to this break in relations was Dick Parker. Remember
                    Richard Parker?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, he just died.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: He just died —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, Dick Parker was the first president in my little
                        Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: He was a great scholar of Middle Eastern affairs and culture and a very
                    well respected man. And I was the first American ambassador after the resumption
                    of diplomatic relations. And the Algerians had a very interesting policy. They
                    scrupulously respected and encouraged Algeria's commercial relations with the
                    United States, and equally so encouraged their military relations with the
                    Soviet Union. So they were walking a very difficult thin line, but they did it
                    very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, prior to — I mean obviously they got to go
                        through congressional hearings and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you prepare to go to Algeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, you know, as someone who was addicted to international news, I
                    didn't have to do very much preparation. I knew what the major issues of concern
                    were between the United States and Algeria. And I had lived in Tunisia at the
                    time of Algeria's independence. So I had lived through a period of very
                    important modern Algerian history and nation building. So I didn't need to do a
                    lot of preparation. Certainly among the more interesting people that I had to
                    deal with in my hearings was Senator Richard Lugar. I found him both
                    knowledgeable and well prepared for my hearing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mm-hmm.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>HAYNES: I had and still have the greatest respect for Senator Lugar. He is a
                    very, very fine statesman, in addition to being an excellent senator. Also
                    participating in my hearing was Senator Jacob Javits from New York who was in
                    declining health.</p>
                <p>So, in my senate hearing I was up against some heavyweights. Not against, I was
                    in front of some heavyweights. They were a very friendly group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Didn't want to give you the impression they were adversaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was this a period where we were — was either side
                        pushing to reestablish relations, or was it mutual, or how was this
                        working?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Both sides wanted to reestablish relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that the Algerians — I mean they had this,
                        this tie that goes back to 1830 with, with the French, and they would be
                        happy to bring somebody else in so they wouldn't be — have to sort of be, if
                        not subservient, but have to be overly careful about their relations with
                        the French.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: You would think so. But, the residue of French culture and a respect for
                    France and everything the French represented remains in Algeria to this day, and
                    existed after independence. Look at the huge number of Algerians who have
                    emigrated to France. They are the single largest number of Muslims in France to
                    this day. And Algeria maintained, and still maintains, important commercial ties
                    to France. And, I might add, one of the most important ties, oddly enough for a
                    Muslim country, is supplying France with table wine. Much of the table wine that
                    one drinks in France, when you go to a caf� or a bistro, comes from Algeria to
                    this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our interests in Algeria when you were getting
                        ready to go there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, obviously we did not want Algeria meddling in the Arab/Israeli
                    crisis in a way that jeopardized our interest. And then of course we wanted to
                    protect our access to Algerian oil and gas. Very important.</p>

                <p>HAYNES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Algeria, sort of politically and
                        economically when you went there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, Algeria has never had a very strong domestic economy. Politically,
                    it was very oppressive. It was a police state, clearly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about the fundamentalist, Islamic
                        fundamentalist? Was this the factor that it later became or —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Not at all. They didn't exist at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of questioning did you get through the
                        Senate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Very polite. They handled me extremely gently. Nothing that indicated to
                    me that they had a great understanding of American relations with Algeria, or a
                    great interest. Remember, at that time, the Cold War was preeminent among the
                    interests of most American foreign policy experts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the people dealing with Algeria in the
                        State Department treated you? Because you weren't the normal political
                        appointee. I mean you'd certainly been around the block.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I called myself an “inside outsider.” I already knew so many of them.
                    Harold Saunders, who was then the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern
                    Affairs had been a graduate student when I was a law student at Yale. And we
                    served together on the National Security Council staff. So, I knew a lot of the
                    people that I was dealing with. And that was a help. However, I will never
                    forget, after having arrived in Algeria at the end of June, my first really
                    official function before I presented my letters of credentials, was hosting the
                    American embassy Fourth of July celebration. And as I passed — on the grounds of
                    my own embassy residence — as I passed a group of American embassy wives I heard
                    this snip of a conversation. One wife said to the other wife, “Have you seen
                    what Washington sent us this time?” And the other wife replied, “Yes. And I'm
                    not going to have it in my house.” They were talking about me and my
                    appointment.</p>
                <p>Q; Oh, my God.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>HAYNES: And the fact that I was a black ambassador, which was still pretty rare.
                    You know, I was — while Algeria's considered the Near East in the State
                    Department, it was not a typical appointment for a black ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no, I — yes, the — well —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Let me tell you how I dealt with that one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: One of my first official acts was to schedule a tour all of the American
                    embassy residences rented or owned in Algiers to give the lie to the Embassy
                    wife who said that I would never set foot in her house. Sure enough, when I got
                    to her house, she did not offer me so much as a glass of water.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, my God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And I'm going to tell you, it's — from my point of view, that wrecked her
                    husband's career. Because as soon as I could, I decided we could not afford to
                    have an American family with this kind of prejudice representing us abroad, and
                    I arranged for his transfer. It's something that we just cannot tolerate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely not. I mean, you know, badmouthing and, I mean
                        you're just not getting the full cooperation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, not only — not only that, but if she had that attitude toward her
                    ambassador, what did she think of the Algerians?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, my God, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>HAYNES: And I must say, I wasn't far from wrong. Not long afterwards, we
                    constructed a swimming pool for the embassy staff and one of the administrative
                    officers came to me and said he was speaking on behalf of the American families
                    who did not want to have Algerians swimming in the same swimming pool with them.
                    I was dumbfounded. When I recovered I said, “Listen. Do you know to whom you're
                    addressing this request? You're addressing this to someone who as a little boy
                    couldn't swim in public swimming pools because of the color of his skin. And you
                    want me to turn around and treat other people the same way? Get out of here!” I
                    was furious!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (sighs) How were you received when you arrived there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: (laughs) With surprise. I'll give you a funny anecdote. When I presented
                    my letters of credentials to President Boumedi�ne in the presidential palace I
                    was accompanied by my DCM who was white. And as I approached the president to
                    present my letters of credentials, he extended his hand to my deputy, rather
                    than to me. And I said, “Excuse me, Mr. President, but I'm the ambassador.” I
                    cannot tell you how embarrassed he was. And I later used that to my advantage.
                    Thereafter, whenever I requested an appointment with the president, I got it. He
                    was so embarrassed. But, hey, we have ourselves to blame too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes! Well, okay, here's a country and we've been —
                        well, actually we've gone about 14 years without relations, weren't
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, I don't remember the exact number of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I mean anyway, significant number. What was there to
                        do to sort of get the machinery running again?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Not very much, because during this time our commercial relations had
                    prospered, and there were many American oil executives based in Algeria. And
                    this was a sector, as I said, the Algerians were very intent on maintaining with
                    the United States. It took a little more doing to develop military relations, or
                    as we call them, defense relations, and political relations with the Algerians.
                    The one thing they did not want the U.S. meddling in their internal political
                    affairs, and this was one of the problems that they had with the Soviets who
                    were a little bit heavy handed in this respect. But, in no time, I'm proud and
                    happy to say, our embassy became a very popular place for Algerians, and a very
                    important listening post for me. One of the reasons for this is attributable for
                    my wife, Yolande, who decided that she would open a snack bar in an empty
                    embassy garage adjacent to our chancery, because our staff lost precious time
                    driving home to lunch every day. And that took a big chunk of time out of their
                    workday. So she set up a snack bar and very quickly that snack bar became a
                    popular place for middle level and some senior level Algerian officials to come
                    for a quick bite to eat at lunchtime. And I'll tell you, quite frankly, it was
                    probably a most important listening post to find out what was going on in
                    Algeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but I mean just —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: The mood of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I can understand why — I mean this is before the
                        great influx of the McDonald's on the other thing. I mean the French, of
                        course, had this tradition of a two to three hour lunch and all, which an
                        awful lot of businesspeople, including the French, found a bit much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And going and having a hamburger or hotdog or something
                        —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: — you know, and sitting down, and you could have actually
                        a pleasant lunch and leave in half an hour or so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Exactly. And in fact, we had other embassy — other ambassadors from other
                    embassies actually came to have lunch. The French ambassador was a regular. And
                    it was a very lovely setting because we had people sit outside in the garden.
                    So, it was a nice place to even come for a cup of coffee.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your dealings with the French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: A lot, and they were very cordial. I had very good relations with the
                    French ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any — we're often rivals commercially. I mean
                        was this a problem or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: No, the French were getting the lion's share of Algerian oil. We were
                    getting 100% of Algeria's natural gas, which was very important. But our
                    commercial interests with the French were complementary, not competitive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As ambassadors go, very few come in with the international
                        experience that you'd had in, sort of in the business world. Did you find
                        this stood you well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: It was enormously helpful, enormously helpful. It gave me credibility
                    with the American business community in Algeria, as well as with the Algerians
                    dealing with that community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as a new, newly open representation, were you able
                        to set up the equivalent to the American Chamber of Commerce and relations
                        with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: There was an American businessmen club, not a Chamber of Commerce.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that? Was this a good instrument to deal
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: It was a very important source of information — firsthand information
                    about our commercial relations with Algeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean were there sort of problems with Algerian
                        bureaucracy and all in getting things done?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, it didn't function like the American bureaucracy. It was excessively
                    bureaucratic, if I can use that term again. But problems? No, we didn't have
                    major problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Polisario movement? What were we doing with
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>HAYNES: My instructions from the department were that I was to have no direct
                    contact, nor official contact with the representatives of the Polisario in
                    Algeria. However, it was impossible to go to a diplomatic reception without
                    running across them. I did not publicly shake hands or engage them in
                    conversation. But I do recall on one occasion being invited to dinner at the
                    home of a senior Algerian Foreign Ministry official, a dinner party at which the
                    Polisario was present. Now, you can't be stupidly — how can I say — political in
                    situations like that, and walk out, or refuse to say good evening. No, I — yes,
                    the Polisario was very much present, very active, and I dare say, very effective
                    and well supported by the Algerians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean obviously you were getting information on them,
                        what was your reading on this movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I must say that, to this day, I consider the Polisario to be a legitimate
                    independence movement. I had visited what was then the Spanish Sahara with Soapy
                    Williams way back in the early 1960s. And I remember our conversation with the,
                    with the local Sahraoui administrators in which they were looking forward to
                    being an independent nation. Remember that, I think it was the Green March —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: — or the Great March. When Hassan II, King Hassan II in Morocco just took
                    hordes of Moroccans and marched them into this former Spanish Sahara and took it
                    over. And in the proceedings before the International Court of Justice it has
                    been declared an illegal takeover. And, and the Moroccans have successfully
                    resisted complying with the Court's ruling to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have relation with our ambassador in Morocco, for
                        example, or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Our ambassador?</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, I knew him — at the time - it was, Angie Duke, Angier Biddle
                    Duke.</p>

                <p>HAYNES: And he too was a friend from beforehand, so we had very close relations.
                    And Angie, like many, many American ambassadors, had a bad case of “localities”.
                    He was a firm supporter of the Moroccan monarchy. They could do no wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, that's — coming back to Dick Parker, he, being

                <p>HAYNES: Very much so. He got to know them much too well and made them feel
                    uneasy. He spoke their language. He spoke not just Arabic, but he spoke Maghrebi
                    Arabic, their kind of Arabic. Which made them very, very uneasy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm told — somebody in one of my oral histories was saying
                        the story was that in Algeria when Dick was ambassador there, there was a
                        Cabinet meeting and Dick was present talking about things, and at one point
                        Boumedi�ne turned to his Cabinet and said, “How come the American ambassador
                        speaks better Arabic than you do? Most of you speak French,” you know
                        (laughs).</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: That's right. No, he was, he was absolutely fluent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And, I daresay he was beloved by all Algerians who had nothing to do with
                    — and if they didn't love him, they respected him, which was just as
                    important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's see. You were there. How were the Algerians
                        seeing the Americans at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh. They had a, a very important self-interest in maintaining good
                    relations with the Americans. And the proof of the pudding was that they were
                    willing to serve as our intermediaries years later in the Iran hostage crisis.
                    And they did a magnificent job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during this, weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Very much so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm just thinking this might be a very good place to stop
                        for this section so we can devote more time to your time during the hostage
                        crisis. And you know, some other questions, how'd you find the — I'll put it
                        in here so I can put it in here next time — how'd you find the officers of
                        the embassy and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Well, today is the 29th of June, 2011 with
                        Ulric Haynes. And Rick, we've started — we're in Algeria. And you were in
                        Algeria from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: From 1977 to the beginning of 1981.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to some of the other developments, how did
                        you find the embassy staff while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I was a little disappointed in what I considered to be their lack of
                    background and preparation for their assignments, with the exception of the
                    public affairs officer who later became my DCM. His name is Christopher Ross.
                    His father was Tony Ross, who was a very well known American ambassador, highly
                    respected. Chris had served in Morocco before coming to Algeria and was fluent
                    in Maghrebi Arabic, the Arabic that is spoken in Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco.
                    He was also quite fluent in French. None of my other Foreign Service officers
                    were fluent in French and none in Arabic, and that was a major drawback.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can imagine. Well, then were you and the officers able
                        to get out in the countryside, or was it dangerous?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh no, not at all. I traveled extensively even into the Sahara Desert as
                    a guest of the Algerian government down into the Hoggar and the Tassili. And I,
                    my family and I also camped out on some of the beaches near on the Mediterranean
                    coast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well was —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Let me modify that with one — in one respect. When President Boumedi�ne
                    fell ill and ultimately died, the restrictions on travel and the police
                    surveillance was quite widespread.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why? Was there fear of a coup or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: When Boumedi�ne fell ill?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I would suspect that the military, who really have controlled Algeria
                    since its inception, were very conscious of the possibility of forces in the
                    country that were opposed to their government taking advantage of the crisis in
                    leadership. So, they took all sorts of steps to prevent that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem with Boumedi�ne?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: His illness?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, I — I cannot remember what it was ultimately — I don't think we ever
                    really knew what he was diagnosed with. But, he did have a terminal illness and
                    in fact we arranged for an American Military medical unit to come over with a
                    mobile CAT scanner and examine him. And it was, I believe, a brain tumor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have much, an active information program going on?
                        I'm thinking of contact with the media, placement of things on TV, that sort
                        of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, placement of things on TV was virtually impossible because the
                    media and television were very tightly controlled by the government. But we did
                    have quite an effective cultural program. For example, I remember Joan Baez came
                    over to give a concert.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>HAYNES: And it was very interesting because Joan Baez's father was working in
                    Algeria at the time. Don Baez was his name. And I cannot remember whether he was
                    working with AID or with an American company affiliated with the oil industry.
                    But he was responsible for bringing his daughter over, and our cultural affairs
                    officer and public affairs officer collaborated in making the most of her visit.
                    One of the interesting things about her visit — and I will never forget it — at
                    her public concert, she got the Algerians, who are Muslims and mostly Arab to
                    sing along with her the Israeli national anthem, Hagan Navila.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah-ha.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And it was very moving. The audience lit candles or pieces of paper and
                    waved them in the air. Joan Baez struck a very moving blow for Arab/Israeli
                    relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, in so many of the Arab countries, we're beaten on the
                        head with our relations with Israel. How about in Algeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Much less than elsewhere in the Arab world. It is not such a great — in
                    fact, the further away in North Africa you get from the Middle East, the less
                    important it becomes. For example, Morocco, at that time, was the only Arab
                    country that had diplomatic relations with Israel. And to this day, there is a
                    significant Jewish community in Morocco. Indeed, one of the financial advisors
                    to King Mohammed VI is a prominent member of the Moroccan Jewish community. I'm
                    talking about the present king.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And, in Algeria the president of the Bar Association of the capitol of
                    Algiers was an Algerian Jew. When the French controlled Algeria, early on they
                    gave French citizenship to Algerian Jews, but denied it to Algerian Muslims. As
                    a consequence of which, several enterprising Muslim families in Algeria just
                    changed their religion to Jewish. These were, generally speaking, very well
                    educated Muslims, or Muslims in the business world. The Jewish president of the
                    Algerian Bar Association during my time was Roger Said, S-A-I-D, with an Arab
                    name who was the offspring of one of these families that had just up and changed
                    their religion, as a matter of convenience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hm.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Now, another thing that happened while I was in Algeria. Shortly after I
                    arrived, some young Algerian hoodlums took it upon themselves to desecrate the
                    one synagogue that still existed in the city of Algiers. The Boumedi�ne
                    government condemned their act and actually rebuilt, restored the synagogue even
                    though there were not many practicing Jews in Algeria at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How stood relations between Arabs and the Berbers when you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Very tense. The Berbers tended to be more westernized and better
                    educated. Indeed, some Berber families even converted to Roman Catholicism and
                    were practicing Christians. But the tensions arose over the Arab majority's
                    refusal to allow the Berbers to teach their language or use their language in
                    public schools. It was an attempt on the part of the Arabs to establish the Arab
                    culture as the dominant culture of Algeria. And this is despite the fact that
                    many of the top government officials and particularly civil servants were
                    Berbers.</p>
                <p>They did not call themselves Berbers in Algeria. They called themselves
                    Kabyles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mm-hmm.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And the region where they were most popular was called the Kabylie.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a problem of, you know, from your standpoint of
                        sort of American be nice to one and not the other, I mean did we get caught
                        in between them or not or did they try to —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: No. We maintained good relations during my time with both communities.
                    And on the local embassy staff there were Berbers as well as Arabs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about migration to France?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, that was the dream of all young Algerians. And I'm told it still is
                    because of the massive unemployment in Algeria. There just are no opportunities
                    for even university educated Algerians in the country. So France is looked to as
                    a kind of Mecca.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean looking at it as an outsider, did you see
                        that the Algerians weren't taking advantage of what I'm told is, you know,
                        very rich soil and real agricultural and other opportunities there, or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>HAYNES: No. Farming was quite important, but the Algerian government, which
                    called itself socialist, did not encourage the private ownership of the means of
                    production. And as a result, farmland, particularly along the Mediterranean
                    coast that had been considered the breadbasket as far back of the time of the
                    Romans certainly was not as productive under the independent government of
                    Algeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did we get involved with assistance, or did the
                        French get involved with helping with agricultural assistance? Or was it
                        just it was not the methods, but it was just the — sort of the socialist
                        policy that was screwing things up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: It was the socialist policy that was screwing things up. And it continues
                    to do so to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: There were, you know, in a country that had been virtually
                    self-sufficient in terms of food, there are, and have been since its inception,
                    serious food shortages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Indeed, let me just give you a little anecdote. We had a five-acre
                    embassy compound — quite a lot of land. And my wife planted a very extensive
                    vegetable garden, which provided us and some of our embassy staff with
                    vegetables in season. And she also had chickens. Now, all of this, the five
                    acres, could be pretty well concealed without sacrificing the beautiful
                    landscaping of, of the embassy grounds and gardens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now turning to events outside, how did the initial
                        problem in Iran with the Shah, did that — was that over the horizon and not
                        of —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: It was not of great concern. When you say the problems with the Shah,
                    Iran had an embassy in Algeria and Algeria maintained correct relations with the
                    regime of the Shah while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well —</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>HAYNES: You must remember that the Arabs of North Africa and the Middle East do
                    not consider the Iranians as cultural brothers. The Iranians themselves don't
                    like to be confused with Arabs, and Iran doesn't like to be lumped in with the
                    rest of the Middle East. So they had correct, but not warm relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when our embassy was taken over, did that put you
                        all on the alert or not, or were you sort of away from that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: We did not at all feel threatened in Algeria by the embassy takeover in
                    Iran, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were there attempts by the Iranians to incite the
                        Algerians or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: No. Iran and Algeria did not have any common ground in the sense of
                    political ideology or anything like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this brings us to the Algerian Foreign Ministry. You
                        know, in my time in the Foreign Service they've always been considered to
                        have one of the more professional Foreign Services. Did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes, they were very, very competent. And at the time that I was there,
                    the foreign minister was Mohammed Ben Yahia. He was a very, very competent man
                    who conducted with extraordinary skill the balancing of relations between the
                    United States and the Soviet Union and later between the United States and
                    Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Soviets? Their presence there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, they were quite active, particularly in the area of military
                    relations and military spies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this concern us or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: We respected the careful balancing of relations that the Algerians
                    maintained because they did so scrupulously and were so conscious of encouraging
                    the commercial relations with the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did our attach�s think of the Algerian Military?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>HAYNES: The general feeling was that they were very competent. At that time it
                    was before the Muslim Brotherhood became active and an internal threat. But, it
                    is to their credit that to this day they have been able to control the Muslim
                    Brotherhood in Algeria. Mostly the Algerian Military was preoccupied with the
                    situation of the Polisario and Morocco in the Western Sahara and with
                    maintaining internal security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, down in that western border, how stood things? I
                        mean could we go down there and look at it, where the Polisario were doing
                        their thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: We could go down to the Algerian side of the border. But certainly the
                    Moroccans would not allow us across the border into the Western Sahara, which
                    was not legally Moroccan territory. I do remember that Andrew Young, as American
                    ambassador to the United Nations, paid a visit to the disputed region and to the
                    Polisario camps on the Algerian side. I did not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I did not because I was instructed by the department not to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How stood Moroccan relations with Egypt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I'm not aware that there was any difficulty between their relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, I can't think of any particular reason.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: An interesting thing. The Maghreb — Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco, not
                    Libya, but Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco — distance themselves from the
                    political problems of the Middle East pretty much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean I suppose that the big event would be all the
                        European tourists descending on you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: In Algeria?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Algerian tourism was not as well developed as the tourism in the
                    neighboring countries of Morocco and Tunisia. No, we did not have a large influx
                    of tourists there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is because of government policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, the development of tourism was not a high priority on the part of
                    the Algerian government. So there were not a lot of world class hotels and there
                    was not an infrastructure in Algeria to accommodate tourists such as there were
                    in Morocco and in Tunisia, even though there were places of enormous touristic
                    value and interest in Algeria, Roman ruins and the Tuareg culture in the
                    Southern Sahara, fascinating, but undeveloped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. It does seem like they sort of missed a lot of
                        opportunities to get better employment and better economy and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, definitely. I think in the back of their mind was that they did not
                    want to see an influx of former French residents, the pieds-noirs, returning to
                    Algeria as tourists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: So I think that discouraged them from developing tourism. But as I say,
                    we — my family and I visited some very, very interesting and impressive Roman
                    ruins all along the Algerian Mediterranean coast. Not as vast and impressive as
                    Leptis Magna in Libya. But, the Romans occupied that entire North African coast.
                    In traveling to Morocco we encountered many, many Roman ruins.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now was there anything to recall the World War II?
                        The American and British, French armies? German armies? Going over that
                        area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes. There were American and British military cemeteries in Algeria. And
                    as I recall on D-Day the British ambassador and I would pay formal ceremonial
                    visits to those cemeteries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much were you involved as our ambassador there to
                        doing the negotiations regarding the hostages in Iran? Or was this sort of
                        taken away out of your hands and off and —</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Not, not at all. Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher enlisted me
                    particularly in the last 14 days of the negotiation process as an active
                    participant in his negotiating. And prior to that, I had suggested that the
                    Algerians be considered as intermediaries because we had broken diplomatic
                    relations with Iran, of course. The Algerians had impeccable Islamic credentials
                    as well as impeccable revolutionary credentials. They were acceptable to both
                    sides. For the Algerians this was a chance to play a major role on the world
                    stage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, from your perspective, how did the negotiations —
                        how were they done and how did they work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, I mean there were enormous logistical problems. Because we did not
                    meet, we could not meet — we the American government side, could not meet
                    face-to-face with the Iranians because we had broken diplomatic relations with
                    Iran — we had to do everything through the Algerians. There was a lot of shuttle
                    diplomacy between Tehran, Algiers, and Washington which was very time consuming
                    and logistically complicated. Documents had to be translated into Farsi, the
                    language of Iran, English, the language of the United States, French, the
                    working language, I should say — of Algeria, and Arabic, the official language
                    of Algeria. And with all that translation going on, the opportunity for
                    misinterpretation, confusion, delay, was just rampant. And it was in the last
                    month of the negotiations, in December 1980, that I suggested to the department
                    that Warren Christopher, our chief negotiator, and his team come to Algiers to
                    facilitate and expedite these negotiations. Fortunately it was one of those rare
                    instances where the department listened to its ambassador, and our negotiating
                    team did come to Algiers for the last 14 days of the negotiation process.
                    Actually, they came for 48 hours and stayed 14 days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Uh-huh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Once Warren Christopher arrived, he realized how — with the clock ticking
                    on Carter's presidency, that time was running out. And time was of the
                    essence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did things work out for you all there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, it was a very difficult time because, on the one hand, on the
                    personal level, my family and I were packing up to leave Algiers. And at the
                    same time we had to accommodate a team of I would say — well, let's see — I
                    would say five or six American negotiators. Warren Christopher came over with
                    Hal Saunders, who was the assistant secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, and with
                    Arnold Raphel who later died in a tragic plane crash when he was American
                    ambassador to Pakistan.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>The British also sent over the governor of the Bank of England — I believe that
                    was his title, the governor — I believe his family name was Lascelles. He was
                    related to the queen, to her mother, the queen mother. This was primarily
                    because the Bank of England was a depository for a lot of Iranian funds held in
                    banks outside of Iran. It was an exhausting time because we could never sleep in
                    Algiers. When Washington was awake, we had to be awake. When Tehran was awake,
                    we had to be awake. We were at a pivotal, pivotal point where we had to be awake
                    and on the alert 24 hours a day because of the time differences between
                    Washington and Tehran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And by the way, one of the interesting things is that I ended up doing a
                    significant amount of translation and interpreting even though Washington, the
                    department, sent over a very gifted bilingual interpreter, Alec Toumayan, who
                    had interpreted for several American presidents. Alec was a highly respected
                    Belgian-born American and an extraordinarily gifted linguist. But, he had to be
                    present at the meetings between the Algerians and the Americans because the
                    Algerians were using French as their working language. And none of the American
                    team members except myself was fluent in French. Again, this was a shortcoming
                    that I've emphasized over and over again. Our pitiful, self-defeating lack of
                    the language competence is something that plagues us to this day. But, if Alec
                    Toumayan was interpreting at meetings that were going on and a document had to
                    be translated from French into English it fell upon me to do it. I didn't even
                    have an embassy secretary who was fluent in French. And the department was
                    unable to send a bilingual secretary to accompany the negotiators coming over
                    from Washington. I was shocked. I was appalled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My God, no, that's really — does strike home.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And you would think that we would — would have awakened to this basic
                    weakness by now. But I'm afraid it goes beyond the department to the American
                    system of education which does not encourage the study of foreign languages.
                    Unfortunately, there are so many American communities that have tried to
                    establish English as their official language. In the process, they discourage
                    the study of foreign languages. We've got to wake up to this basic weakness in
                    our culture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, were you all looking toward the inauguration date of
                        Reagan? Just prior to it as sort of the goal to be, to be observed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh very definite, very definitely, because Reagan had announced publicly
                    that if a resolution to the crisis was not reached — he would have no choice but
                    to start all over from the beginning with negotiations. And that was a sobering
                    fact, I think, to the Iranians. But what we didn't know, and what has yet to be
                    proven and documented, was the — was it — I believe it was called, in the press,
                    the media, the “October Surprise”. This was the allegation that Reagan and his
                    team had sent people to, I believe, Germany, without the knowledge of
                    negotiators or the Carter administration, to encourage the Iranians to delay the
                    release of the hostages until after Reagan's inauguration as president. Yes, I
                    believe — it was called the “October Surprise” in the media.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. Well, did you have any contact with the Iranians who
                        were in Algeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: None, because there was no functioning Iranian embassy. Remember, this
                    was a revolutionary government that had just taken over in Iran and they had not
                    yet appointed new ambassadors. And the Iranian embassy in Algeria was a holdover
                    from the days of the Shah, and there was no ambassador. And it was not a
                    functioning embassy. It was useless. Useless to us in the negotiations process.
                    Furthermore, having broken diplomatic relations with Iran, we were effectively
                    prevented from having any contact with the Iranians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in the last days what were you up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: We were working out such things as whether the blocked Iranian funds in
                    American banks, British banks, and other European banks would be released and
                    how, and under what conditions the hostages would be returned to us, whose
                    planes would fly them our of Iran, and so forth. There were all sorts of little
                    details like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave Algeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, I left within days of the inauguration of President Reagan. I had
                    submitted my resignation as all American Ambassadors do when there is a change
                    of administration. It had been accepted, and we packed up and we left within a
                    week of the Reagan inauguration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, did the hostages pass through Algiers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes, the Algerian government sent two Air Algerie planes — Air Algerie
                    being their commercial airline — to Tehran. And they sent two because they did
                    not want the rest of the world to know on which of the two planes the hostages
                    were. So one plane was a decoy.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would that be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, they were afraid of someone taking the opportunity to shoot the
                    plane with the hostages out of the air. They were just super cautious. And we
                    respected that caution. So the planes flew from Tehran, as I recall, to Athens
                    to re-fuel, and Athens to Algiers. At about two or three in the morning, all of
                    us negotiating, staff and Algerian officials went to the airport to receive the
                    hostages. We saw the two planes in the air. We did not know in which one the
                    hostages actually were, not until they landed and they opened the doors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of reception were they given?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, they were treated royally by the Algerians. For example, the
                    Algerians, knowing that they were all Americans and they'd been prisoners for
                    444 days and not, not — (laughs) not having any alcohol and not having any pork,
                    arranged for them to have ham sandwiches and champagne!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Which I thought was a very sensitive touch. And I'll never forget. Warren
                    Christopher, my wife and I went to the bottom of the stairs, when the door of
                    the Air Algerie plane opened. It took a little while and we were a little
                    concerned, but shortly (the hostages were deciding in what order to leave) our
                    Iranian embassy DCM —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bruce Laingen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Bruce Laingen, and the two ladies who had been prisoners, I believe both
                    with USIA, came off with locked arms. It was a very, very moving moment. And
                    recorded on television around the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you left, came back. This would be —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Excuse me. I should mention that Warren Christopher signed the official
                    document acknowledging that all the hostages were accounted for. They were given
                    coffee and juice and some hors d'oeuvres and almost immediately loaded on
                    American Military planes and flown to Wiesbaden, Germany for medical examination
                    before coming to the United States.</p>

                    <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, so what about you and your wife and family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: We packed up and left and returned to our home in Columbus, Indiana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then what were you up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: The Cummins Engine Company, where I had been vice president for the
                    Mideast and Africa prior to becoming ambassador, had engaged me again as vice
                    president for International Business Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the intervening four years or so, how had Cummins
                        changed, or had it changed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, it hadn't changed very much at all. It was like going home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how long did you do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I believe I was there for two years and then I resigned from the company
                    and moved to St. Croix in the Virgin Islands with my family where I became an
                    international business consultant on my own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did that last?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, that was another two years. And then I, I became president of AFS
                    International, the American Field Service international student exchange
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is usually at the high school level, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: At the high school level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I've heard very good reports of that. How did you
                        find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I found it in organizational disorder. There was financial mismanagement,
                    it was in need of reshaping, which I attempted to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>HAYNES: Well, not very well because some of the members of the board of directors
                    of AFS were very embarrassed by some of the mismanagement that I discovered in
                    the time that I was there. And, and it became abundantly clear that I'd lost
                    their confidence and it was time for me to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Then I was hired by an executive outplacement firm, the top executive
                    outplacement firm in New York City and in the country, Drake, Beam and Morin.
                    And I stayed with them for about another two years until I was recruited by
                    Hofstra University to become their dean of the school of business. Where I
                    stayed for about nine years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Hofstra University?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Hofstra University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is that located?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Hempstead, New York in Long Island.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find sort of returning to academia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Doing what?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Turning to academia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I thought politics — national politics and international politics was
                    bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: But my God.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>HAYNES: I was totally unprepared for the nastiness and pettiness and conniving of
                    academic politics. Have you had the experience?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but I've heard people talking about, saying it's so —
                        I think it was Kissinger who was supposed to say, “Because the issues are so
                        small, the conflicts or great,” or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: They are indeed. They are indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the — was it mainly over distribution
                        over funds?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Academic prerogative, who gets tenure and who doesn't get tenure, and who
                    has a big office, who doesn't have one, who, who gets time off for research, who
                    doesn't, whose teaching load is heavier than who else's. The last thing that the
                    academics seem to be concerned about is the education of the students. Personal
                    prerogative takes front seat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh boy. But you did that for nine years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: My role changed. I became the university vice president for international
                    relations and my principal preoccupation was increasing enrollment of students
                    from overseas. And that was — of the nine years I think that was the last two
                    years. Ultimately I retired from that position and continued to work as a
                    consultant in international student recruitment for Drew University and other
                    institutions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah-ha.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And in that capacity I traveled around — literally traveled around the
                    world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you finding America was a real attraction for
                        students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Very real. American higher education is very popular and very highly
                    respected around the world, even though our secondary school education cannot
                    complete with such nations as Finland, which ranks first, believe it or not, and
                    the rest of Scandinavia. I believe United States secondary education ranks
                    around twenty-fifth in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can believe it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>HAYNES: It's deplorable. I mean our own students aren't prepared for university
                    studies, especially when it comes to math and science and foreign languages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: And, I can't — I mustn't forget history. I'll never forget teaching a
                    group of students in international relations at Rollins College, which is an
                    excellent school here in Winter Park, Florida, not far from my home. We were
                    talking about the ongoing crisis in the Middle East. And I referred to the
                    Ottoman Empire and I saw a look — a blank look on the faces of the American
                    students in the class. And I said to them, “Tell me about the Ottoman Empire.”
                    And it was only the students from abroad who seemed to have any notion. How can
                    you understand what's going on in the Middle East without knowing its
                    history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's criminal. Have you sort of continued with this
                        educational bent, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Yes, I continued up until about a year ago when international travel
                    became a physical burden to me. And at the same time, I was an adjunct professor
                    at Rollins College and at the University of Central Florida, and at Florida
                    Southern College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you done any sort of recruiting for the Foreign
                        Service during this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh none, none. I've never been asked and I think it would be quite
                    unusual for the department to go outside its own ranks to recruit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, you know, if nothing else to talk it up or
                        something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh yes, oh yes. I've talked with many of my students. A couple of them
                    have actually gone into the Foreign Service, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what we're doing here now is part of a process that
                        I hope will eventually penetrate the system, and that is to make both the
                        public, but also the educators, aware of the role of American
                        diplomats.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>HAYNES: And to make those within government and, and particularly our elected
                    representatives in the House of Representatives appreciate the role of diplomats
                    and the importance of training diplomats, above all the importance of training
                    American diplomats. I picked up the newspaper yesterday and see that we've done
                    it again. We've just named a new ambassador to Cape Verde who is a black female.
                    The combination of naivety and racism that goes with such an appointment I
                    continue to find appalling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's the political process.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, my God, yes. But you know, here we — we've had two African American
                    secretaries of state (Powell and Rice) and we have an African American
                    president. And that pattern of racism in ambassadorial postings cannot be
                    broken! I just can't understand it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, well I think — Rick, I think this is probably a good
                        place to stop. I hope next time, or some time, when you're in Washington,
                        give me a call and we can get together and chat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Oh, I would love it! We'll have to break bread together or something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: I rarely get to Washington, but if I ever do you'll be high on the
                    list.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, all right. Well Rick, take care and thank you very
                        much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HAYNES: Not at all.?</p>
                <p>ADDENDUM</p>
                <p>HAYNES: Stu, after we completed our telephone interview, I realized that missing
                    from my comments to you was any mention of my numerous activities with not for
                    profit Boards of Directors, corporate Boards of Directors, published articles,
                    and other career-related activities.</p>
                <p>First of all, I neglected to mention among the positions I held in the mid-1980's
                    was that of Acting President of SUNY College at Old Westbury on Westbury, Long
                    Island, NY. I held this position for a year and a half after leaving the Cummins
                    Engine Company and suspending my business consulting.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>The corporate boards on which I served included the Boards of Directors of HSBC
                    Bank USA, American Broadcasting Companies, Rohm and HAAS Company, INNCOM,
                    Reliastar Insurance Company of NY, Pall Corporation, ENVIPCO, Hemmeter
                    Enterprises, and the NY Stock Exchange Individual Investors Advisory
                    Committee.</p>
                <p>The not for profit boards on which I served included those of Pratt Institute,
                    Deep Springs College, The Dance Theatre of Harlem, Educational Policy Center,
                    The Louis August Jonas Foundation, and the Salzburg Seminar. In addition, I have
                    been a member of the Council on Foreign Relations for more than 45 years; I
                    believe I was only the second black member of the Council after former Deputy
                    Secretary of State Dr. Clifton Wharton. Similarly, I have served on an Amherst
                    College Visiting Committee as well as a member of the Henry Luce Foundation
                    Asian Scholars Selection Committee and as a member of the United States-South
                    African Leadership Exchange Program (USSALEP). I have served as a member of the
                    NY State Central Pine Barrens Joint Planning and Policy Commission.</p>
                <p>In the field of higher education, I am currently a member of the Advisory Boards
                    of the Middle Eastern Program and its Islamic Studies Program of the University
                    of Central Florida where I am also a Distinguished Visiting Scholar. I have also
                    been a Distinguished Visiting Scholar at Florida Southern College. At Rollins
                    College and at the University of Central Florida, I have also been an Adjunct
                    Professor of International Relations, as well as an Adjunct Professor at the
                    Harvard Business School. At Hofstra University, I have served as Dean of the
                    School of Business and as Executive Dean of University International Relations.
