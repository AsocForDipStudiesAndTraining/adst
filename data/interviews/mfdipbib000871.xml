                <p>Interviewed by: W. Haven North </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 6, 1996</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is January 6, 1996, and we are having an interview
                        with Robert H. Nooter. He left AID at the end of 1979. At that time he was
                        the Deputy Administrator. He then went on to other assignments, which we
                        will cover later. To start off, Bob, tell us something about where you came
                        from, where you were born, your family background, your early education, and
                        so on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Family, education, military service and early work experience</p>
                <p>NOOTER: Thanks, Haven. I was raised in St. Louis, Missouri. During WWII I went
                    into the Marine Corps, where I was assigned to a V-12 Unit and sent to the
                    University of California, after having had one semester of college at Purdue. I
                    graduated there after the war ended, in 1947, with a B.S. in Industrial
                    Engineering. I went to work for a quasi family company called the Nooter
                    Corporation, which was involved in manufacturing chemical and oil field
                    equipment in St. Louis. I married Nancy Lane Ingram, who I met at the University
                    of California at Berkeley while I was going to college. We were married in 1947,
                    just after I graduated and then went to live in St. Louis, where I worked at the
                    Nooter Corporation for the next 14 years except for a fifteen month period
                    during which I was called back to the Marine Corps to serve in the Korean War in
                    1951-52.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you serve in Korea at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Yes, I was in a line infantry battalion in Korea for nine months. In 1961
                    the Nooter Corporation sent me to the Harvard Advanced Management Program, which
                    is a three month program that is sort of an abbreviated M.B.A. for people who
                    are already working. While I was there, one of our substitute teachers was a
                    professor who was on loan to the Kennedy Administration working in the White
                    House. He talked about their efforts at recruiting people from business and the
                    difficulty they were having.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>NOOTER: Dan Fenn. I had always, for some reason, had in my mind that at some
                    point in my career I would want to go to work for the government, perhaps after
                    I had been successful at business or whatever. But the excitement and interest
                    in the Kennedy Administration, and the opportunity that came up at that time,
                    made me think that this just might be a good time to make that change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of positions did you have in the Nooter
                        Company?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I started out as a young sales engineer, worked then on the production
                    side in the manufacturing plant, and was vice-president in charge of
                    manufacturing at the time I went to Harvard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many people did you have under your supervision?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Virtually the entire manufacturing side of the business, which was about
                    1200 people. It was a medium sized company in a kind of high tech capital goods
                    industry. While I enjoyed my business career, it just seemed like an opportunity
                    that was too good to pass up.</p>
                <p>Attraction to the Kennedy Administration and government service</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were you feeling a need to shift or wanting to shift?
                        Do you have any idea what brought that about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Only because, as I said, in the back of my mind, I had this notion of
                    perhaps wanting to join the government at some time, although it was not at all
                    in the tradition of my family. This was maybe ten or fifteen years earlier than
                    I had had in mind. I was about 35 years old then. It was in large part the
                    attraction of the Kennedy Administration and the feeling that there was
                    something very exciting going on in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the year you went to the Harvard Business
                        School?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>NOOTER: I went to Harvard in 1961, at the very beginning of the Kennedy
                    Administration. I went to speak to Dan Fenn after the class was over. He
                    encouraged me to put in an application and to come see him when he was in
                    Washington, and see what possibilities might work out. So, I did. He was in
                    charge of recruiting, I think, for senior executive personnel for the
                    administration. I expressed an interest in either the Foreign Aid Program or the
                    Defense Department. I was less interested in Defense, but I thought my
                    background in manufacturing might qualify me more for that than AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were you interested in the Foreign Aid Program? Where
                        did you hear about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: That's a very good question. I can't really say what brought it to my
                    attention. I was aware of the fact that there was a Foreign Aid Program and that
                    it had been reorganized. And I was aware that the new head of it was Fowler
                    Hamilton. It turned out Fowler Hamilton was an old friend of the lawyer for our
                    firm, a fellow named Walston Chubb. I remember calling Walston from Harvard and
                    asking him to contact Fowler Hamilton to see what the possibilities were of
                    coming to work for AID. Walston almost had a fit because he couldn't contemplate
                    my leaving the company. He tried very hard to dissuade me from following this
                    avenue, and it was not any help at all with Fowler Hamilton since Walston did
                    not want me to leave. So I was aware of foreign aid, I guess, just from the
                    newspaper. There was no other direct connection of any kind. As I said, it was
                    not in our family tradition at all to serve in the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your Korean experience give you any kind of exposure
                        to the international world, foreign cultures, or anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Undoubtedly. I had been in Japan for a few days on the way to and from
                    Korea. And, of course, Korea in those days wasn't even a developing country. We
                    were up in the hills fighting in foxholes. I suppose it had some bearing on it,
                    however.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Kennedy School. What was this program again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: It was called the Advanced Management Program, and it was a three month
                    program designed to cover most of the subjects covered in a two year M.B.A.
                    (Master's Program). It was for people who were in business who couldn't take two
                    years to do it, but who might, on the other hand, have had enough background and
                    experience so that they didn't need as extensive a course as people just out of
                    college. It was a very good program, very stimulating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you remember any of your professors or people who had
                        an impression upon you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>NOOTER: George Baker, who later became the Dean of the school, was one of the
                    outstanding professors. There was also an Australian fellow whose name I don't
                    remember, who was in charge of the program. It was a very stimulating time and
                    sleep wasn't very important. There was great excitement all the time, not only
                    in the program but because of the whole Cambridge area. At Harvard, on the main
                    campus, we went to interesting lectures, and being in the Boston area was a
                    wonderful experience. So, that whole period was a period of high excitement.</p>
                <p>Joining AID and Operation Tycoon - 1962</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went direct from there. How did the assignment in
                        the government evolve?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Getting into AID was interesting. I contacted Dan Fenn in the White
                    House. He in turn put me in touch with two government agencies. One was the
                    Renegotiation Board, which was a board created in World War II to renegotiate
                    company profits. In fact, I had represented our company before the Renegotiation
                    Board in the 1950s; not any major issues, but I was familiar with the board and
                    their operations, so he put me in touch with them. It was run by a five person
                    appointive executive committee, headed by a former governor of Oklahoma, I
                    believe.</p>
                <p>I visited the Board, and it was an absolutely moribund organization that had been
                    downsizing for the last ten years, and it no longer had a very vital function to
                    fill. I met the chairman, the former governor, who was an extremely nice and
                    intelligent fellow who, in my own interest, thought that I wouldn't find the
                    Board a very challenging assignment, which I agreed with. I don't think he was
                    just trying to talk me out of it - he sincerely believed that it was an
                    organization on its way down and out.</p>
                <p>Dan Fenn also put me in touch with AID. I don't remember my first contact with
                    AID, but I think it was simply through submitting biodata in writing. By this
                    time I had returned to St. Louis. After an interval of thirty days or so I got a
                    letter from someone named Wolf in AID, which I remember very well because it
                    made clear to me that AID had no interest in anyone with my qualifications and
                    therefore I should forget the whole thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what the letter said?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>NOOTER: Yes, that's right. I called Dan Fenn in the White House, who said, “Don't
                    pay any attention to that because that's just the bureaucracy reacting to the
                    notion of outsiders coming into the organization.” And he then linked me to a
                    recruitment process which later became known as Operation Tycoon, where the
                    Kennedy Administration had called on business to recruit executives to come in
                    and presumably give the Agency a more business-like operational base. My
                    recruitment then followed that process, although I was not originally located
                    through that program, in which the Government had gone to businesses and asked
                    for people to be nominated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a government wide program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: No, this was just for AID. I don't know the number of people, but there
                    must have been, at the time I came into the selection process, about eighty or
                    one hundred people who were being interviewed and meeting with AID for possible
                    recruitment. That number was pared down for one reason or another. We went
                    through various interviews. I remember being interviewed by Jim Fowler in East
                    Asia at that time, Ted Moscoso in Latin America, and others. Finally, the group
                    was pared down to a much smaller number - I think thirty-five or forty of us.
                    They had been selected by AID as the group that they would want to retain, but
                    then we had to go through a political clearance. That involved having an
                    interview with someone in the White House who did the political clearances, not
                    the fellow who had recruited me. I recall that we had been led to believe at
                    that time that we had in fact been offered jobs. And I remember I came to
                    Washington for this final interview and was speaking to a chap who had notified
                    his company that he was leaving. He must not have passed the political clearance
                    process, however, because he did not show up in the final group that was
                    recruited.</p>
                <p>The whole process was a bit, what shall I say, jerry-built. But, nevertheless, it
                    resulted finally in a group of about thirty of us coming in to take positions in
                    AID. Some of the people in the group were quite impressive and had had extensive
                    overseas experience in business, others less so. Most of them were from
                    management. There were one or two people with engineering backgrounds who went
                    into the engineering side of AID. The only other comment I'll make on the group
                    is that most of the people who came in left after the first two to four years. A
                    lot left after a two year assignment, and then another group left after two more
                    years. After four years there were only three or so of us still in AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your first impressions of AID at that time? You
                        must have been getting some very definite impressions after talking to all
                        the people.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>NOOTER: Well, the situation was chaotic. The Kennedy administration decided to
                    change the entire upper appointive structure of AID, and the top fifteen
                    presidential appointive positions were all people recruited from outside the
                    agency. So there was a complete turnover at the top. Furthermore, Fowler
                    Hamilton, who was a very successful and important New York lawyer, was thought
                    not to be a very good manager, and he was let go after something like a year on
                    the job. His deputy was a fellow from Proctor and Gamble, who had had a very
                    senior position in Proctor and Gamble's management, named Lingle. I remember
                    after being there a few months, I had met Lingle leaving the State Department
                    around seven o'clock one evening. We were in front of the State Department - I
                    don't know whether we were looking for a cab, or waiting for a ride, or
                    something - and I asked him how things were going. He told me that he was just
                    departing because he had decided to quit after about six months on the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I can understand because I don't ever remember
                        hearing the name.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: No, he went in and out in eight or nine months - I'm not sure, but he was
                    not on the job very long. He was thought of as a management expert, and I think
                    was the person who was supposed to make up for Fowler Hamilton's lack of
                    management experience. In any event it was very chaotic but nevertheless
                    exciting. I still remember the thrill of walking into the State Department for
                    the first time. For someone who had no previous contact with the government
                    going into those hallowed halls, which now look a bit bedraggled, was quite a
                    thrill in those days.</p>
                <p>I remember Ted Moscoso, who was in charge of the Latin American region, had a
                    clock on his wall with the handset at one minute to midnight. His theme was that
                    in Latin America, with the influence of Castro and so on, it was one minute to
                    midnight and the U.S. had better get on the ball and begin doing something or
                    everything was going to blow up. That was the kind of sense of excitement and
                    urgency that pervaded the entire place.</p>
                <p>But at the same time it was chaotic because the management were new to their jobs
                    and were still learning their way around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when? 196...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I came on board in about April 1962. I don't know when Fowler Hamilton
                    left but it was not very long after that when Dave Bell took over—and if you
                    think of it, Dave Bell had been in charge of the Bureau of the Budget and one of
                    Kennedy's right hand men. But both Kennedy and he decided that it was more
                    important to run AID than it was to run the Bureau of the Budget, which gives
                    you some idea of the sense of priority that the Foreign Aid Program had at that
                    time.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Also, I will say that out of those early management changes — with all of the
                    turmoil that was going on at the time that I speak about—came what I think was
                    really an outstanding management team in AID. It proceeded from the time Dave
                    Bell took over through the John Hannah years and left a legacy for a long time
                    thereafter. All during the sixties I always had the feeling that any issue - no
                    matter how difficult and contentious it may be within the bureaucracy - if it
                    got high enough in the agency, up to the top management's attention, there would
                    be a sensible decision made. That was very reassuring because, as we know having
                    served there, there are many contentious issues. Many agencies of government are
                    involved in some of the AID decisions and there are many different viewpoints. I
                    think that the management team, what really evolved out of those years of
                    turmoil, was first rate from about 1962 to 1973.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: No, he had already left before I came. Frank Coffin was there just a
                    short time after that before Fowler Hamilton. He ran the transition from the
                    previous organizations to AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a very articulate person, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I didn't know him very well. But at the time I was there Fowler Hamilton
                    and Lingle were already running the organization.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: When I came in this group of thirty, we were given a six week orientation
                    program, which was quite comprehensive. We didn't go to the Foreign Service
                    Institute. This was run specially for us in the Woodward Hotel, and our families
                    were included.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Woodward or The Willard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: No, the Woodward Hotel over on 16th Street, where AID rented space and
                    carried on this program, which was specially designed for this group using some
                    Foreign Service Institute people for background briefings and also special
                    briefings by AID people from the field, academics and so forth.</p>

                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>NOOTER: I remember a fellow from Cornell named Alan Holmberg. He was running a
                    very interesting program in Peru. He was in Peru trying to transform an Indian
                    village into something more economically successful and he described the
                    difficulties of achieving development when it requires a cultural transition.
                    Some of the officials of AID also gave presentations. Generally it was a very
                    good program. I can't remember the details of it, but it did give us a good
                    background in what economic development was all about and what the program was
                    trying to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got a State Department briefing about the foreign

                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I can't remember that there was a State Department involvement in the
                    program, but there probably was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any kind of Cold War Policy briefings at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: No, I don't believe so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm raising the question because it is kind of
                        interesting: What were people trying to communicate at that time, and
                        therefore, what were the policies on people's minds? What were they
                        concerned about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I don't think there was much of a political side to it. It was mainly:
                    What is economic development? What is it all about? How do you go about it? What
                    are the approaches? In retrospect, I would probably find it not terribly
                    profound, but at least it exposed us to the ideas that were around at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>Assignment to Uruguay as Mission Director - 1962-64</p>
                <p>In any event, I then was offered a position as Mission Director in Costa Rica.
                    No, actually first Dominican Republic, and it changed about six times before I
                    finally ended up in Uruguay . The Dominican Republic was the second, then Costa
                    Rica, then finally Uruguay. I, of course, didn't speak Spanish, and so I went to
                    an eleven week crash course in Spanish. A week before the course was supposed to
                    be over, Ted Moscoso called me in and asked if I would go to north-east Brazil
                    instead of Uruguay. By this time our household belongings that we were shipping
                    to Uruguay had already been sent and were on the high seas. I had learned ten
                    weeks of my eleven weeks of Spanish, and they, of course, speak Portuguese in
                    Brazil. My whole training in business was that if the boss wanted you to do
                    something you generally said yes. However, this is where I first learned that
                    sometimes in the government you need to say no. So I told Moscoso that it was
                    not a good idea, and I turned him down.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Uruguay your choice or was there not much option?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: It was simply that they were filling a number of smaller posts with
                    people like myself from the outside who had limited experience in economic
                    development. I don't think they wanted to entrust us with major posts. Generally
                    people with management backgrounds from the special recruitment program either
                    went as heads to small posts or deputies in large posts. So, as I said, I was
                    considered for a number of the small posts. In the case of the Dominican
                    Republic, as I recall, the feeling was that this assignment was so urgent that
                    they needed someone who already knew Spanish. They couldn't stand the eleven
                    week delay to try to learn it. Of course you don't learn Spanish in eleven
                    weeks, but the thought was that you could.</p>
                <p>So, it was just a matter of elimination of what was available. I was amenable to
                    any reasonable suggestion, except not a change at the last minute that would
                    have required going through another language training program to be able to go
                    to north-east Brazil. That post was on Moscoso's mind, I guess, because that was
                    considered a very hot area at that time. I think Donor Lion went there at that
                    time instead. He was a career AID person and did a very good job.But we went to
                    Montevideo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: It was around September 1962. I had a two and a half year assignment
                    there and returned in December 1964.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the program? Why were we providing assistance to
                        Uruguay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Uruguay is a relatively prosperous Latin American country. I don't
                    remember the per capita income, but it was not low. Uruguay is a very
                    sophisticated country, reminiscent more of Europe than of an underdeveloped
                    country, and like Argentina, had been very successfully developed up through the
                    thirties, but it had fallen on hard times. The AID program had actually phased
                    out there in, I think, 1958. But it was being reopened in 1962 as a result of
                    the agreement of the U.S. to give substantial assistance through the Alliance
                    for Progress, which was conceived in Punta del Este in 1961.</p>
                <p>Uruguay came back into the AID program because of the Alliance for Progress. You
                    asked why we were there. I remember being shown, in great secrecy, by the State
                    Department the transcripts of some of the discussions that had gone on that
                    formed the basis of the AID program in Uruguay because I had asked exactly your
                    question. Why are we going there? What is the level of aid, and on what basis is
                    it conceived? What kind of program is it to be?</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>What these transcripts revealed was that Uruguay had been promised a certain
                    level of aid if they would vote for the Alliance for Progress, which was
                    actually in great doubt as to whether it would be accepted by the OAS countries.
                    My understanding was that it needed a two-thirds vote to be accepted by the OAS.
                    The Alliance was a program in which the U.S. agreed to provide aid, and the
                    Latin American countries agreed, at least in a general sort of way, to follow a
                    set of policies having to do with what would make their countries develop more
                    effectively. A lot of Latin American countries at that time didn't want to be so
                    closely associated with the U.S.</p>
                <p>The Uruguayan vote was the one extra vote needed to make the two-thirds majority.
                    The president of Uruguay - they had a rotating presidency at that time; a nine
                    man council governed the country, and one of the members of the council served
                    one year - held out for a certain level of aid, which depending how you read the
                    transcript was either 10 million or 20 million dollars. It was not the only time
                    I was involved in a politically motivated aid level where the amount was not
                    clear.</p>
                <p>AID thought the agreement was for a ten million dollar program of assistance. The
                    period was somewhat indefinite as to whether that amount was for one year or two
                    years. A small office had already been set up in Montevideo with a couple of
                    people from AID's regular staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's step back. Do you remember what the Alliance for
                        Progress policies were? What kinds of things these countries were being
                        asked to commit themselves to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I really don't, but it's certainly on the record. It's a written document
                    that was a public document, and it indicated what they would do on their side as
                    part of the commitment to use the aid well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This transcript didn't say anything about that with
                        Uruguay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: No, it was only in the context of how much aid they would get if they
                    voted for the Alliance for Progress. It was a rather cynical note on which to
                    start my AID career. And incidentally, while I was going through my processing
                    in Washington a group of Uruguayans arrived. I can't remember who they were, but
                    it included some senior people from the Ministry of Housing and somewhere else.
                    In our very first conversation with the Uruguayan government officials about
                    aid, the Communist threat and the need to provide aid as a means of offsetting
                    that threat was the Uruguayan's main line of argument as to why they should get
                    aid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a threat?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>NOOTER: I think in a sense that all of Latin America was intrigued with Castro at
                    this point, and the United States was very much the villain. When we went to
                    Uruguay, the walls of the city were painted “Yanqui fuera,” meaning “Yankee Go
                    Home.” I remember one evening we were walking on the streets of Montevideo
                    around midnight and there was a rally going on with a lot of people and a lot of
                    shouting and speech-making. We came up to the back of the crowd and listened,
                    and it was an anti-U.S. demonstration. So we quietly slipped off, since I
                    frankly never looked very Uruguayan and was always easily identifiable as an
                    American.</p>
                <p>The feeling against the United States was very intense in 1962.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it the popular feeling as well as the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: It was much more of a popular feeling than a Government position. As
                    usual in these things, on a personal level this was never a problem. We had many
                    good Uruguayan friends. Usually these were people, of course, who were upper
                    income level. The people we rented a house from became good personal friends. We
                    still stay in touch with them. So on a personal level you didn't feel the
                    antipathy. But a large part of the population must have felt this way. You got
                    the feeling from public expression that to be pro U.S. was definitely out of
                    style.</p>
                <p>I'm skipping ahead in my narrative a little bit but to complete this point. The
                    fascinating thing was that when Kennedy was assassinated there was an outpouring
                    of sympathy for us, as if our father or mother had died. The Uruguayans came by
                    our house in enormous numbers to pay their respects. That moment changed the
                    atmosphere about the United States more than anything that I can think of
                    certainly during the time we were in Latin America. Somehow we were no longer
                    the Yankee oppressor, we were now wounded and vulnerable ourselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Uruguay at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: We were in Uruguay at that time. It was an amazing transformation. I
                    never felt the anti-Americanism in the same way after that. I don't know what
                    others would say who were living there at that time in other parts of Latin
                    America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, how long were you there before that happened? About a
                        year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: When was Kennedy assassinated? I guess that it was 1963 or early '64, and
                    we got there in August of '62. Most of the time we were there was before the
                    assassination and only a short time after. But the anti-American feeling was
                    running very high before that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's go back to...you were just getting there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Also another theme that we will come back to in our interview is that in
                    those days AID ran large overseas missions that were empowered to do a great
                    deal. But someone in AID had the notion that we really ought to change that
                    style. The notion was that the AID mission in Uruguay should be a three person
                    mission, that that would be the size of it. That was predetermined - three or
                    four including the secretary because you had to have a U.S. secretary for
                    security reasons. If you had classified documents you had to have a U.S.
                    secretary to handle them.</p>
                <p>So I went to Uruguay with the understanding that it would be a four person
                    mission. The way AID was structured didn't make that very practical, however. I
                    think by time I left, the mission had grown to ten U.S. staff. But somebody was
                    thinking at that time of changing the style to smaller missions. As I remember,
                    the mission in Thailand at that time was about 400 Americans plus local staff.
                    When I got to Liberia, we had about 300 people, 150 direct hire and 150
                    contract. But in Uruguay they had the notion that they wanted to run a small
                    mission.</p>
                <p>We set out to try to identify programs. Some technicians had been there ahead of
                    me trying to develop programs. There was an agricultural program that was really
                    in agricultural education. It had been conceived and was in the later planning
                    stages. There were preliminary plans for a housing program and one of the staff
                    had been working on giving a loan to a cooperative bank for subloans to members
                    of the cooperative for agricultural processing. And this was the program we were
                    putting together and trying to get started.</p>
                <p>Also during the time I was there, we began a police training program, a kind that
                    was popular in AID at that time. AID had the notion that part of the government
                    outreach to the people was through the police department, and if police services
                    were oppressive and brutish then the governments would appear to be oppressive
                    and brutish. On the other hand, if police were trained to be efficient and
                    courteous, the country would be better off. That program later became the basis
                    for the incident that happened in 1969, when urban guerrillas in Uruguay, called
                    the Tupamaros, kidnapped the head of the AID police program and created an
                    enormous international incident. It became the basis for a movie done by the
                    same fellow who did “Z”, and the result was that Congress decided that AID's
                    police program should be stopped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that happened after you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>NOOTER: Yes, in 1969 and I left in 1964, but the program had started during my
                    tenure. It's only later, when the U.S. began getting involved in places like
                    Somalia and Haiti, that the U.S. Government came back to realizing that police
                    training is an essential part of running a modern government. If you are
                    starting to build a government structure, this is one of the essential services.
                    This would be an interesting study for some researcher to go through the whole
                    history of this program, but not stop in 1970, but to continue on up to the
                    present day, including the Somalia experience.</p>
                <p>John Hannah, who became head of AID in 1969, was one of the early supporters of
                    police training when he was the president of Michigan State. John had that
                    notion very much in mind and felt very strongly about it. I know he thought it
                    was a big mistake when they were required to pull back from those programs. It
                    is certainly true that the publicity that was generated by the police programs,
                    where the revolutionaries tried to make the U.S. appear as oppressors because we
                    supported the police was very bad for AID. But the basic concept of training
                    police not to be oppressive is essentially sound.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any elements, though, in the public safety
                        program using it by other agencies in the U.S. government for intelligence
                        and other covert activities. Did you ever see any evidence of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: At the time I was there it was not used that way in Uruguay. I guess that
                    it was not uncommon for police programs to have some individual in that group be
                    a cover for a CIA person. Again, the notion of using AID for CIA cover came out
                    as an issue in the early 70s and John Hannah put a stop to it everywhere around
                    the world in all AID programs. Of course the State Department was used as a CIA
                    cover and probably still is. Where else are they going to be put? But so was
                    AID, and it probably was a mistake to use AID for a CIA cover. But once it came
                    out and became public knowledge, it was cut everywhere except in Laos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked about agricultural education and public safety.
                        Were there other programs that you were working on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Yes. I was there two and a half years. The Agriculture Program made the
                    most headway and had the most impact on the ground. For the cooperative bank
                    program, we actually entered into a loan agreement but before the loan ever
                    became effective it became obvious that the bank was going bankrupt. No money
                    was ever dispersed against it. I believe that happened after I left, or about
                    the time I was leaving. That program didn't work out simply because the
                    institution became insolvent.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>But I remember when I returned to Washington after my two and a half years there,
                    Bill Rogers, who had been Chief Legal Council in the Latin American Region and
                    had taken Moscoso's place as the Assistant Administrator for Latin America,
                    asked me what my overall impression was of the time I had been in Uruguay and my
                    whole experience there. Off the top of my head I said, “Bill, I guess in
                    retrospect I would say we tried too hard.” What I meant was that the Uruguayans
                    were really not that interested in the AID program. Maybe some individual that
                    we were working with might have been, but the country was too sophisticated, the
                    amount was too small, and the impact was too little to be significant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What level are you talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: About ten million dollars. I don't think we ever spent more than ten
                    million dollars there. Those amounts were too small to be a real interest to
                    them. The loans had to go through their Parliament after they had gone through
                    their central bureaucracy. The program really didn't generate enough interest to
                    deal with all of the bureaucratic obstacles that had to be overcome to put them
                    into place and make them effective.</p>
                <p>There was another small program that we at the time thought was useful. Funds
                    were made available to the planning organization, which was headed by Enrique
                    Iglesias. He was thought of at that time as a bright young economist, which he
                    was, and a potentially significant future government official in Uruguay,
                    although he was a naturalized Spanish citizen. People even thought of him as a
                    possible president of Uruguay, except that he couldn't become president because
                    he was a naturalized citizen. We gave relatively small amounts of money to
                    provide technical assistance to help the planning organization that he headed. I
                    don't know how much use that was but Iglesias, at least, went on to a very
                    successful career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any dealings with him at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Oh, yes, very much so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he the recipient of any assistance or training
                        programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Well, not he personally, but we were financing some of the technicians he
                    wanted to bring to Uruguay to develop various parts of the planning operation.
                    He now is the head of the Interamerican Development Bank.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>The other things that may be of interest have to do with the breaking in of a
                    person who comes from the outside into the government bureaucracy; who comes
                    with an engineering background; who comes into what is basically an economic job
                    requiring an economic background. And into a situation with a lot of tension, a
                    lot of pressure to deal with, in this very political ambiance relating to
                    Castro's influence on Latin American at that time.</p>
                <p>The U.S. Ambassador to Uruguay at that time was Wimberly Core, a career State
                    Department person who was quite fluent in Spanish and knew Latin America very
                    well. Wim was an extremely cautious person. He recognized that I was a newcomer
                    and an outsider. He was also extremely cautious about every cable that was sent
                    from the Embassy because he had lived through the McCarthy period and knew how
                    important any written record was. So at least for the first year and a half that
                    I was there, every routine cable that we needed to send to Washington, or other
                    documents that were going to AID, would be scrutinized carefully by the
                    Ambassador. I remember one evening being in the Embassy at twelve o'clock at
                    night going over cables, sitting up on the second floor of the Embassy while
                    demonstrations were going on in the streets below. Fortunately, the Embassy was
                    not on the ground floor. And we were sending our AID messages to Washington at
                    midnight.</p>
                <p>The U.S. Ambassador was very competent and we got along very well. In due course
                    I gained his confidence and in fact he was willing to take chances when he
                    understood them fully. He sided with me several times on the clearance of people
                    who were going for training in the U.S. when the CIA director thought that they
                    were too leftist to be sent. The Ambassador, in every case, supported my
                    recommendation.</p>
                <p>I ultimately think I had a better relationship with him, or a more trusting one,
                    than almost anyone else in the Embassy. Finally, when he went to another post in
                    Ecuador, he was declared persona non grata for giving a speech in which he
                    criticized the government of Ecuador at that time, which was a very poor
                    government. The speech was cleared by Washington, but nevertheless was delivered
                    by him. Of all people, it seemed ironic that Wimberly Core would be declared
                    persona non grata.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of working with the Uruguayans,
                        people in the government, and so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Let me finish with the Embassy first. There are some other interesting
                    points there.</p>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>NOOTER: I was fortunate to have the Economic Counselor that we had, named Louis
                    Mark. He was a Hungarian born, European trained economist and in retrospect, I
                    would say quite an outstanding economist. He could be quite tiresome. If he were
                    here, I would tell him that to his face, because he was also extremely cautious
                    and went over every one of our cables because the Ambassador said that all AID
                    cables had to go through the Economic Counselor. Incidentally, this is where I
                    learned a good bit about the relationship between AID and the State Department,
                    which in the field and in Washington is always contentious. To my mind it is
                    understandably so, and that is something we can talk more about when we get into
                    other jobs where I was involved heavily with State as well as AID.</p>
                <p>Louis taught me economics, for which I am very grateful. I got a good grounding
                    in practical economic application in Uruguay. His junior assistant, a very
                    junior foreign officer at that point, was named Bill McDonough, who was the
                    brightest person in the Embassy. He had the best connections with Uruguayans, he
                    and his wife. He spoke fluent Spanish in a short time, as younger people seem to
                    be able to do. We always had more information coming in through Bill than any
                    other source in the Embassy. Bill also got training from Louis Mark, although he
                    was a trained economist to start with. Bill is now the head of the Federal
                    Reserve Bank in New York, the second highest position in the Federal Reserve. He
                    left the Foreign Service after eight or ten years, I guess, and went into the
                    banking business before joining the Federal Reserve. I heard him speak recently
                    and he is still as good as he ever was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me break a minute...Let's now turn to relations with
                        the government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: The individuals that wanted assistance and thought they were going to get
                    it were, of course, friendly with us. One incident that I remember very clearly
                    was that of the head of an agricultural educational institution, named Luis
                    Balparda. He was an extremely fine gentleman. At that time it was AID's
                    requirement, under Congressional legislation, that all structures built with AID
                    funds had to bear the clasped handshake symbol. Balparda had a hard time
                    understanding why Uruguayan buildings should bear the “union label,” or the
                    label that symbolized their poverty, if you will.</p>
                <p>I recall that while he and I were on very good terms, we spent several extremely
                    trying and difficult sessions before I was able to convince him that while it
                    was unfortunate from his viewpoint, there was no other way around it but to have
                    that symbol on his buildings. He finally accepted it, but I would say it was
                    something he accepted with the utmost reluctance.</p>

                <p>NOOTER: Dealing with the Uruguayans was like dealing with Europeans. They were
                    proud people - well not overtly as proud, say, as the Argentineans - they
                    weren't haughty people, but they were intelligent. One of the things I learned
                    is that in developing countries you have individuals who are often more
                    sophisticated, more educated or well-trained and competent than comparable
                    people in our country. It's not as though you are dealing with people that you
                    can dictate things to. You have to deal with them on equal terms. You have to
                    have a relationship based on mutual understanding and mutual confidence and
                    trust. But that was possible in Uruguay. It was not that they were prepared to
                    accept anything we told them; it was that they had to be convinced that it was
                    in their interest to do it.</p>
                <p>I remember when we negotiated a loan. I think it was the housing loan. We had a
                    rather arrogant AID negotiator from Washington who came down as the chief
                    negotiator. He was entirely too arrogant for the situation, and it was a most
                    trying time. We finally got through after about three difficult days of
                    something that should have been done in two hours because he was simply too
                    arrogant.</p>
                <p>So the relationships could be difficult even though the people were generally
                    friendly. My personal relationships were quite good. I remember that after the
                    loan was approved we had to get the Attorney General's opinion, as we do on all
                    loans, that the signatures were valid and the documents were legal. We waited
                    for months and months, and I kept going into the bureaucracy to find where this
                    was held up. Finally I located the fact that the Attorney General was an old
                    fellow who was sitting on this for no apparent reason. After we got to know each
                    other, and chatted for a while, it turned out that both he and I had been at the
                    inauguration of the United Nations in San Francisco in 1945. He had been there
                    as part of the Uruguayan delegation and I had been there as a student at
                    Berkeley. Once he learned that, we got along famously, and he quickly approved
                    the document the next day and that was the end of it.</p>
                <p>One other interesting thing in Uruguay was that part of my economic training was
                    watching the Uruguayans lose all of their foreign exchange holdings in four
                    months. I arrived in August of 1962, and they had a national election in
                    November. Between July, just before I arrived, and November the peso, which they
                    were trying to hold at a fixed exchange rate - this had been the government
                    policy for the previous three or four years - the peso was beginning to slip,
                    and they didn't want to devalue before the election. The Government had a
                    hundred million dollars in July, and by November they had zero. And in those
                    days, for a country the size of Uruguay, a hundred million dollars was a lot of
                    money. It all went out the window in four months because the speculators knew
                    that the currency was overvalued, but the Government would not devalue.</p>
                <p>Then they had to turn to the IMF. That was my first experience with the Fund and
                    it was quite interesting. It taught me the power of exchange rates and what
                    happens with the way money can be lost when exchange rates are mismanaged.</p>

                        flight?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: It was simply that the peso was overvalued. It was the exact precursor of
                    what happened in Mexico two years ago. Anyone who had lived through the
                    Uruguayan experience had no trouble understanding what happened in Mexico, where
                    again they didn't want to change the value of the peso, which had become
                    overvalued, because of an election coming up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were running a big deficit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: So the speculators took all of the money out of the country.
                    Incidentally, the government won its election by a very narrow majority, and so
                    they won another four years in office. But it was not a happy four years for
                    them because they had lost their foreign exchange reserves. It was a very
                    difficult economic time.</p>
                <p>Uruguay was one of the few countries at that time that had a flat or negative
                    growth rate. At the end of my time there I thought of writing a paper on it,
                    because at that time it was rare. Uruguay, Britain, and Sri Lanka were countries
                    that had roughly zero growth going on at the same time. I started to do a paper
                    on why that happened, but never did finish it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your thoughts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: In retrospect, I guess you would say the similarities in those countries
                    related to excessive spending for what we now call entitlements. But the other
                    factor that was certainly true in Uruguay was that the excessive entitlements
                    had been made possible by the windfall earnings that flowed into the country's
                    foreign exchange reserves during and after World War II and during the Korean
                    War, when wool and beef prices were extremely high. This created income that was
                    then locked into the social system through increased pensions, increased
                    government employment, and so on. When those foreign exchange earnings dropped
                    because the price of wool and the price of beef, which was their main export,
                    declined in the world market, their foreign exchange earnings went down but the
                    commitments that had been made on the basis of the inflows were still in place.
                    They couldn't withdraw the pensions, or cut back on the government employment,
                    because it was politically difficult to do so. This would later be known as the
                    Dutch disease.</p>
                <p>In any event, what it taught me was that fluctuations in foreign exchange
                    earnings are extremely difficult for countries to deal with when they have
                    political systems that want to spend the money that comes in when times are
                    good. All countries that go through this now, say with oil, have a major problem
                    to deal with unless the oil is going to last them indefinitely. It's a problem
                    to keep temporary windfall earnings from having a negative impact on the economy
                    ultimately.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Mission Director in Liberia - 1965</p>
                <p>NOOTER: An assignment came up in Liberia which was offered to me while I was in
                    Uruguay. I don't know what was going on in the AID assignment process except
                    that they thought I had learned enough by that time to be able to handle a
                    larger mission. And Liberia , while it is a very small country, had a very large
                    USAID program at that time.</p>
                <p>I recall Ed Hutchinson called me and offered me the assignment, which I
                    accepted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you had felt you had been in Uruguay long enough? You
                        were eager to go, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I thought I had done about all I was going to do there. As I said, the
                    Uruguayans were not really terribly keen on AID. AID was not a major factor in
                    their economic life and while we enjoyed the time there and I found it very
                    useful for what I learned about economic development. I don't think the question
                    of staying on there ever really came up. This other offer came along and it was
                    a much more important job so I don't think we ever really considered staying on
                    another tour in Uruguay.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, my own feeling is that two year assignments are too short. Maybe
                    from the Agency's viewpoint a reassignment at that time may or may have not been
                    a good idea, but I didn't have any reason to question it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went directly to Liberia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: After home leave. We spent thirty days or so in the United States and
                    then we went to Liberia, which was an entirely different situation. Liberia had
                    at that time about 1.3 million people. The AID organization had, as I mentioned
                    earlier, 300 people - 150 direct hire and 150 contract people. We had programs
                    for all aspects of their economy. There the AID program was important to their
                    economy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: In the early part of 1965. I recall one of the Liberians saying, in a
                    kind of artless way, “Bob, you may not be a very important person in your own
                    country, but you're a pretty important person here.” (laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That certainly is true in Liberia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: In fact, when we walked down the street, a good many of the people knew
                    who we were. It was that significant to them. The country was divided between
                    the Americo-Liberians, about 40,000 Americo-Liberians who were descended from
                    the returned American freed slaves, and the native people who had to some extent
                    intermarried with them. But the Americo-Liberian group was still quite distinct.
                    It controlled most of the wealth and had most of the college degrees. Almost all
                    of the ones with college degrees were from that community and they certainly
                    controlled the politics.</p>
                <p>Most people don't know, though, that President Tubman , who was Americo-Liberian,
                    was not part of the inner circle of the Liberian elite. He was a kind of
                    outsider who had come to power. He didn't belong to what was called the Buchanan
                    Clique of Liberian politicians who usually controlled most of the government.
                    Tubman, on the other hand, courted the tribal people because he thought of it as
                    an alternative, or part of his power base in dealing with the Buchanan
                    group.</p>
                <p>Tubman was very much loved and admired by most of the tribal people, even though
                    he was an Americo-Liberian. I heard many of them express concern as to what
                    would happen when he left, whether the tribal people would become more oppressed
                    and so on. He built roads and schools up into the hinterlands. He brought tribal
                    people into the government to the extent that that was possible because of the
                    limitations of education. He appointed the first tribal cabinet Minister, the
                    Minister of Education. This was the first tribal person to have gone on to get a
                    Ph.D. abroad somewhere and Tubman brought him back and appointed him
                    Minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember his name.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: No, I don't. But it was an example of Tubman trying to bring tribal
                    people into the political system.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>As I remember AID had ten different programs. That included a program at the
                    University of Monrovia, helping to run and develop the secondary school system
                    of Monrovia. There were also programs for primary education all around the
                    country and a health program. We were committed to building a hospital, which,
                    given AID's concept of concentrating on preventative rather than curative
                    medicine was thought of by all of us as unfortunate. But it was something that
                    President Kennedy had promised President Tubman during a state visit to the
                    United States, and there was no way out of it. And in fact, I guess, that
                    hospital served a useful purpose, but I haven't really followed the history of
                    it. It was not completed until after I left.</p>
                <p>We also had programs trying to help industry. Oddly we had almost nothing in
                    agriculture. A lot of AID programs around the world were related to agriculture,
                    and I've learned a lot about agriculture in my time with AID. It is quite clear,
                    of course, that the successful agricultural developments in Liberia were the
                    tree crops. There the plantations - Firestone was the original one, but later,
                    U.S. Rubber and Goodyear also had plantations. Later there was successful
                    development in palm oil. The tree crops are what are possible in Liberia given
                    their climate and their soil. The other attempts to develop other kinds of crops
                    of the kind that we know in this country and in most developing countries were
                    really not successful. At the time I was there we had terminated some failed
                    agricultural programs and were working on trying to find some new ones but had
                    not yet succeeded.</p>
                <p>The new attempt in agriculture while I was there was a program which U.S. Rubber
                    undertook with some USAID funding provided in Washington (to some extent over my
                    objection) to grow corn and other kinds of crops that really weren't suited to
                    the Liberian climate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was called the “large unit agricultural
                        program”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: It was a private sector agriculture program. U.S. Rubber sent out a
                    fellow to run it who was a bright young executive, but he didn't know anything
                    about agriculture. As I said, the decision to support that program was not made
                    in the mission. We worked with the U.S. Rubber executives to help him, but the
                    program failed because the technology was not appropriate. It didn't work in
                    that environment.</p>
                <p>Also, the way they were running it was a highly mechanized approach. There was
                    very little local impact. It was the opposite of a labor intensive approach, and
                    if the program had been successful it would have had very little impact on the
                    local economy.</p>

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>NOOTER: I remember I graded our ten programs from one to ten, and they varied
                    over the entire range in terms of effectiveness. I can't remember exactly what
                    was at the top of the list but I think the secondary school program, which was
                    run by a contract group with San Francisco State University, was the best.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Monrovia Consolidated School Systems was basically a good program. I
                    don't know what impact it ultimately had but it was a good program. We had some
                    rural development programs, but at that time they were in a phase down mode, and
                    we had just one person in each of four counties. They weren't very
                    effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Doing what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Working with the local county supervisors to provide assistance to the
                    primary schools and I can't remember what else. It was limited by the small
                    amount of manpower and, like I said, did not make a very big impact. We had a
                    primary school program that included teacher training and building primary
                    schools up in the country. There had been a program to construct rural roads,
                    although I believe the Liberians did that almost entirely with their own funds
                    when they had some income from rubber and iron ore in the fifties. They used
                    that to build roads and that opened up the country. That was very effective in
                    trying to bring the hinterland into contact with coast.</p>
                <p>We had a public administration program that was helping them to try to make their
                    government more efficient. It was reasonably effective, with a lot of training
                    of people overseas. But, as in other parts of Africa, when people are trained
                    they don't necessarily stay in the position for which they were trained.
                    Somebody trained to be a doctor may very well become a cabinet minister.</p>
                <p>I remember we sent someone for training to be a librarian. And of course it cost
                    a great deal in one of these contract programs to have a U.S. librarian filling
                    the post until the Liberian returned from his training. After this person
                    returned, he took a different position. Then the question arose, should we
                    extend the U.S.-funded librarian at a cost of maybe twenty times the cost of a
                    local librarian. I can't remember the decision, but those are the kinds of
                    problems that came up in trying to build up a system.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, let's back up right now a little bit. Why were we
                        there? What was our interest? What were we trying to accomplish?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>NOOTER: Liberia was always thought of as having some special relationship with
                    the United States because of the fact that freed slaves from the U.S. had been
                    sent there before the Civil War, or assisted to get there, in order to found the
                    country in the first place. Although the U.S. was prepared to largely ignore the
                    country for the next eighty years or so, and it was only in recent times that we
                    began giving them any aid. After World War II there were two geo-political
                    interests there. One was that iron ore was discovered there in fairly rich
                    deposits, and so there was an iron mining industry that was developed. Also, we
                    had a big USIA station in Liberia which broadcast to other parts of Africa. In
                    the Cold War context it was thought of as an important station.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Voice of America</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Voice of America, yes. Robert's Field was an airfield that was considered
                    to be of some importance, although U.S. military didn't use it to any extent
                    that I am aware of. So there were both these historic and more recent
                    geo-political interests on the part of the U.S. However I remember coming back
                    to Washington one time for a review of the Liberian program. There was an
                    inter-agency committee formed to review what was the level of U.S. interest -
                    how important it was, and what influence that had on what the aid level should
                    be, and so on. All of the members of this committee were asked to speak. A State
                    Department officer spoke about the Voice of America station and so on. Finally
                    it got around to the CIA officer's turn, and he said, “Well, I would say that
                    this country isn't really very important to the U.S.” I would say it was a mixed
                    bag. Certainly it had some importance to the U.S. but whether it justified the
                    level of aid we were giving it is another matter. Actually, the aid level wasn't
                    all that big in dollar terms. It was large in staff because it had a high
                    technical assistance component, but it was not so large in dollar transfers - I
                    think it was less than ten million dollars a year. As I remember, maybe six
                    million dollars a year total.</p>
                <p>During the time I was there I did find, having built up the program in Uruguay
                    from maybe four to ten persons, that the numbers in Liberia were excessive and
                    in my two and half years there I reduced the number from 300 to 150 without any
                    noticeable loss of impact on the program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you characterize as the main development
                        thrusts? What were you trying to do with the program there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>NOOTER: In Liberia it really was building from the bottom up. I guess I've come
                    to think that the fact that we draw a boundary around a piece of real estate and
                    call it a country doesn't necessarily mean that it should have all the
                    attributes and the abilities and skills of every other country in the world. If
                    Liberia were, say, in the hills of West Virginia we wouldn't pay much attention
                    to it. It happened to be called a country and so we seemed to think that somehow
                    it should have all of the functions of a government. It should have embassies
                    around the world. It should be able to collect taxes. It should be able to
                    fulfill all of the functions of government.</p>
                <p>But in retrospect I'd say it is an anomaly of history that this particular piece
                    of real estate has a circle drawn around it. But we were trying, in a naive way,
                    to make a functioning nation-state. To do that required education. I don't
                    remember the figures anymore but the literacy rate was less than 10 percent- I
                    think it was about a 6 percent literacy rate at the time I was there.</p>
                <p>I think the emphasis on education was appropriate. Let me mention another kind of
                    lesson. Every country is able to survive, at some level. The only question is at
                    what level and on what basis. There is no magic number of about any particular
                    per capita income that is appropriate for any piece of real estate.</p>
                <p>One other interesting piece of information is that the Liberians were using the
                    American dollar as their currency. They had no independent currency except
                    coinage, which they could issue, and which was limited, of course, because
                    people only could carry a certain amount of coinage. So they were prevented from
                    running budget deficits in the same way that almost every other country in the
                    world can. This was a godsend to them in the sense that there was always
                    relative fiscal stability. The government simply didn't have the capacity to run
                    a budget deficit because it didn't have any money, unless it could borrow it
                    from somewhere. The rate of inflation was always very low. The economic
                    situation in that sense was always very stable. It may have been stagnant, but
                    it was stable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had of course been having assistance programs in
                        Liberia for about twenty years before you got there, going back to '44. Did
                        you see any evidence of these programs or did you get any sense, or did they
                        just sort of evaporate? What did you inherit in terms of development
                        activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: We found some evidence of those programs. There had been a vocational
                    training program which was on its last, just phasing out at the time I was
                    there. I would say it wasn't very effective but it was still visible. I also
                    remember finding school buildings that had been built under the AID program ten
                    or fifteen years before and no one remembered that they'd been built under AID
                    programs at all.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>I remember going up into the country one time on a visit and going to an office
                    that had been part of a rural development program some few years before. That
                    program had been phased out by AID about three years before, but there were
                    still a dozen or so Liberian employees lying around on benches sleeping, so they
                    could draw their government pay. The program had been phased out for three
                    years, and there were absolutely no functions being performed by this office
                    except that it was a source of employment for these dozen people who showed up
                    in order to be able to collect their paycheck from the government - not from
                    AID, but from the government.</p>
                <p>These were the remnants of lost programs. The things that were effective, of
                    course, in Liberia, were Firestone's rubber plantation and some of the other
                    rubber operations. Also, the iron mines, although the biggest iron mine now has
                    drawn down all of its reserves and I believe they are closed now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was Lamco.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Yes, that was Lamco. And the old original iron ore mine had played out
                    long before I got there. Of course Firestone started as being a kind of enclave
                    operation. I think there was a book written about what little impact it had on
                    the country, which is a bit unfair. It's too long a story to go into here. In
                    one sense it was an enclave operation, but it did provide employment for large
                    numbers of Liberians. It did provide resources for the country and it did serve
                    as a basis for individual Liberians being able to grow rubber on their own farms
                    because Firestone would purchase the raw rubber and process it. It provided a
                    market for Liberians who wanted to grow rubber and that had some impact. I would
                    say Firestone's programs had an impact on the country.</p>
                <p>Our education program had an impact, and certainly the training abroad, where we
                    sent people to be trained in the U.S., to the extent that they came back and
                    stayed, had an impact. Amos Sawyer, who was the interim president recently, was
                    one of the bright students of one of our instructors who was employed as an
                    instructor at the University. She happened to be a women whom I still keep in
                    touch with. She always thought Amos was one of her brightest students. I guess
                    there were indirect impacts that are difficult to identify but were real.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your relations with Liberians, in working with
                        them and socializing with them? How did you find that kind of
                        experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>NOOTER: Of course there we had a lot of leverage and we were very popular. I
                    could say it was either for our good looks or for our money. You can make your
                    own choice. We, of course, had good relations with the Liberians at all levels.
                    The only thing that marred that was in the last four or five months one of our
                    local employees, who was a Sierra Leonean national married to a Liberian woman,
                    was arrested by Tubman's security forces and locked up in the infamous Bella
                    Yella Prison. The rumor was that no one ever returned, which isn't true because
                    I went to a coming out party for somebody who was released from Bella Yella
                    once, given, oddly, by the Minister of Public Works.</p>
                <p>We simply weren't able to do anything to get this man released. It turned out it
                    was caused by a marital squabble where the wife's relatives had told Tubman's
                    security forces that this man was disloyal to the president. The fact that he
                    was a Sierra Leonean was also not in his favor. It colored my attitude toward
                    the government to see the repression that was there, but was fairly much under
                    the surface when it hit so close to home.</p>
                <p>That fellow was, ultimately, released. I ran into him some years later in the
                    Johannesburg airport when I was going to Lesotho. He somehow had been released
                    and left Liberia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to use this influence that you had, and the
                        popularity of the AID program, in terms of trying to get policy changes in
                        the government? Was there any latitude in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: One of the most important parts of our program was to help Liberia's
                    general financial situation. Iron ore prices and rubber prices had declined
                    after the various wars, and the Government had spent the money that it earned
                    during the good years on roads and public buildings. So they were hard pressed,
                    and they had undertaken a program with the IMF. We worked very closely with the
                    Fund on that program. It was headed up by a Japanese, who is still a good
                    friend. He later joined the World Bank and opened up the first World Bank office
                    in Tokyo. It was managed from Washington by Moeen Qureshi, who later became
                    Senior Vice President of the World Bank. He came out to visit from time to time
                    to see how the program was going.</p>
                <p>We helped support the IMF program by giving small amounts of dollar aid at
                    critical times. We met regularly with the government to see that they stayed
                    within their budget. That was something that we dealt with at the level of
                    Tubman himself. We would go over the budget with the president, in the presence
                    of our Ambassador, of course. That was the level of influence that we could
                    bring to bear.</p>
                <p>The Government ran a pretty good ship, in terms of keeping their fiscal house in
                    order. This was an effective program, also helped by the fact that they had the
                    dollar there as their currency, as I mentioned. Charlie Sherman was the Minister
                    of Finance at that time and a very effective person. So, yes, we had a lot of
                    influence and we used it, particularly in that respect.</p>

                <p>NOOTER: We had good relations with the Ambassador. He, of course, always went

                <p>NOOTER: Ben Brown. He was quite supportive and helpful. Another interesting note
                    was that Harvard had a team working with the Planning Ministry in Liberia.
                    Elliot Berg was the head of that team during the last half of the time I was in
                    Liberia. Elliot became one of the “fathers” of Structural Adjustment in Africa
                    some years later. I came to know Elliot and I've stayed in touch with him over
                    the years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: That was not Elliot's book. But Elliot had his own ideas on African
                    development policy even before he went to Liberia.</p>

                <p>NOOTER: Yes, that was an effective team. The head of the planning ministry was a
                    good person, who worked with and trained younger people, helping to bring on the
                    next generation. Of course, a lot of that work was wiped out with the coup and
                    now with the turmoil going on there. Some of the people left the country. Some
                    were shot.</p>

                <p>NOOTER: The one that I mentioned. I think it influenced the overall level of the
                    program. The fact that we had such a large operation there was a result of the
                    Cold War interest. There was a large Peace Corps group there, 350 or so Peace
                    Corps people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did AID and the Peace Corps get along together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: We worked very closely together. One of the interesting Peace Corps
                    operations was a group of young MBAs working in the government. They worked very
                    closely with our people who were working on the Public Administration Program.
                    Actually, I hired two of the people from that group to work in the mission, and
                    then later they both became AID employees, and very good ones. That grew out for
                    that relationship.</p>
                <p>Doug Stafford was one of the deputy Peace Corps representatives in the country
                    when we were there. Doug later joined AID several times in senior positions. In
                    fact, we also had a small group of Peace Corps in Uruguay. I always maintained
                    very close contact with the Peace Corps. They later became an excellent source
                    of recruiting material for AID as these people came back from overseas.
                    Sometimes they would go back to school to get an advanced degree and then would
                    be available for employment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you learn from your Liberian experience? What
                        kind of an overview would you give, having spent those years there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: For me this was still part of a learning process, both in Uruguay and in
                    Liberia. I was learning about economics. I was learning about technical
                    assistance. I was learning about how you operate AID programs - what works and
                    what doesn't work. Of course Africa is a tough row to hoe. It is a place where
                    it is difficult to make programs work and have them be effective. But I got a
                    chance to see what was working and what wasn't. It was all part of a learning
                    process for me as well as, hopefully, making the program more effective for the
                    Agency. Those two experiences were very useful as background for the rest of my
                    career in development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't mean to pressure you too much but what would you
                        say was really the core of what you were learning from all of this
                        experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Let's postpone that until later when we have a broader range of countries
                    to look at and I'll make these same points with a little broader background of
                    experience. I guess I would say here that the combination of the way the central
                    government runs its macro economic policies and how AID is run at the grass
                    roots level, and where they meet, is one of the things that I was observing in
                    both countries but in quite different ways. They were entirely different kinds
                    of programs. In Liberia we had very extensive technical assistance - Americans
                    coming to run, train, and show Liberians how to operate things. In Uruguay they
                    knew how to run things - by and large they just needed some money.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does that pretty much cover the Liberia piece for the
                        moment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I think so. The only other personal comment is that my wife and I learned
                    something about tribal culture, and we began collecting African art, which
                    became a very important part of our lives ever after.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the art collection?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: The combination of the knowledge of African culture and the collecting.
                    It worked together. I had a lot of reasons to be out in the country for our
                    program and it gave me a first hand experience. It really plunged us into trying
                    to understand - the anthropologists really don't like the word tribal, but they
                    don't have any good substitute for it - about how a traditional society
                    functions at the village level, under chiefdomships, and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you gave some time, for the art collection and other
                        things, to try to understand the local culture and history.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Yes, and reading some of the information on the art was also reading
                    about the culture. Dr. Harley, who had been a missionary there, who also
                    collected the art, wrote pieces on how the social system functioned in the
                    country in the rural areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of impressions did you have of the society? What
                        were your feelings about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Let's make this point. There was always a classic debate and that is: Is
                    it in the interest of a tribal society to modernize? What would they lose in the
                    process? The village culture isn't ideal, but on the other hand it does have a
                    lot to be said for it. People know their role in society, they have certain
                    social stability. I guess my rule of thumb, from my observations in Liberia, was
                    that a village is a happy village if it had a good chief. That may be a little
                    superficial because the role of the elders is also important in a village.
                    Nevertheless, when the rural people move to Monrovia, for example, they live in
                    quite a different way and the system tends to break down. Often people would
                    question the value of modernization, and we would debate this issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>My conclusion on that point is that it really isn't worth debating because we
                    couldn't do anything about it. The traditional culture is going to break down
                    whether we had a role in it or not. The only question is whether what comes out
                    of it will be better or worse. There is no way this society isn't going to
                    change. I remember having a chat with a fellow who had gotten a Master's Degree
                    and was working in the Department of Education. He was observing how the
                    transition in his society from his father, who had never been to any school, to
                    him, who had had a Master's Degree, compared to in the United States. In my
                    case, my grandfather had had almost no schooling, but my father had gone through
                    ten years of school and I had gone through college, and so there was some time
                    period over which this transition took place. But in his case the transition was
                    in one generation, from nothing to everything. The impact of that on the society
                    was enormous, and as a result he had trouble relating to the village, to his
                    family, and to his social setting because of this transition.</p>
                <p>I think these are some of the problems of Africa that we see the results of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think maybe we should pause there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: When we were leaving Liberia, when our assignment was up there, I was
                    offered an assignment as mission director in Nigeria. This was in 1967. We went
                    back to California for our home leave. At that time the Biafran War was going on
                    and was intensifying and families weren't allowed to go to Nigeria. Therefore I,
                    having had a family separation during the Korean War, decided that we shouldn't
                    go into a family separation again. Therefore, during the course of the home
                    leave, I declined the assignment. I believe families were allowed to go three or
                    four months after that, and it wouldn't have been a very long separation, but of
                    course I had no way to know that at the time.</p>
                <p>In any event...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>A year at the State Department's Senior Seminar</p>
                <p>NOOTER: 1967. The alternative to that assignment was a nine month assignment in
                    the Senior Seminar . This was a seminar for senior people, mainly in the
                    Department of State but also two people from AID, three or four people from the
                    military and one or two people from the CIA, for a total class of 25. If you've
                    covered the Senior Seminar in other context I won't...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I think it's important to bring out what you thought
                        about that experience. What you did and what you learned.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>NOOTER: All right, I think ours was the tenth Senior Seminar class. It was a year
                    in which we had a series of speakers every day and a series of trips. Our trips
                    were entirely within the United States, seeing parts of the United States
                    thought to be of interest to foreign visitors or something about the United
                    States economy or military establishment that would be of use in our future
                    careers. The speakers were quite excellent, very senior people. Walt Restow was
                    at that time NSC Coordinator for President Johnson; Herman Kahn, a Think Tank
                    guru; Gary Cockman, the longshoreman philosopher; several congressmen; senior or
                    retired people from the Department of State; and a large number of other
                    fascinating and interesting people. There would be a one and a half hour
                    presentation with lots of chances for the relatively small group to ask
                    questions and go into the subjects that were the topic of the day. In whole it
                    was an excellent year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the objective of the program? What were they
                        trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: In the case of the Department of State they were all people who had not
                    yet become Ambassadors but were thought of as presumably on an Ambassador career
                    track. Senior people in AID, like myself who had been mission directors or in
                    management of some kind. It was an attempt to broaden us, to give us the widest
                    possible exposure to world issues, exposure to senior people in the United
                    States, or foreigners who happened to be in the United States available to the
                    seminar. It was intended as a broadening experience more than any specific
                    training. We were required to prepare a paper on a subject of our choice towards
                    the latter part of the year, and to make a presentation to the group. That was
                    our only assignment, and that paper did not have to be related to our own
                    particular career subject. Mainly the Senior Seminar was an opportunity to be
                    exposed to people that were involved in important issues of the day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you write about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I wrote on kind of a technical subject. What were the most important
                    factors in achieving successful development and what were the things that made
                    an economy grow successfully. Unfortunately I don't have a copy of that paper
                    anymore. I think it's in the library of the Senior Seminar. It was really based
                    in large part on the work that Hollis Chenery and Dick Strought had done in the
                    '60s. They produced a series of papers that were one very important part of my
                    AID training and background. My paper was really a macroeconomic approach to
                    development and what were the key factors that made, say, Korea, be
                    successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any particular personality or event during that
                        time that stood out compared to everything?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>NOOTER: Not really. Actually, now that I think of it, this was the beginning of
                    the civil rights turmoil. My paper was originally going to be on India. Maybe it
                    would have been related to AID also, but a subcontinent which I didn't know at
                    all. My trip that was to be the basis for the paper would have been a trip
                    around India. At that time there was an attempt to economize on the budget. The
                    effect was that our travel for the papers that we were doing was one of the few
                    things that was actually cut out, due to budget constraint. Instead, I chose
                    this other topic that I mentioned and spent a week at Harvard and MIT working
                    with the economists there rather than going to India.</p>
                <p>I can't say that there was any one particular subject that stood out. It was an
                    interesting group of people, of course.</p>
                <p>Assignment as Deputy Assistant Administrator for East Asia - 1968</p>
                <p>After the seminar I was offered an assignment as the Deputy Assistant
                    Administrator in East Asia . John Bullitt, who was a lawyer and a political
                    appointee, was the Assistant Administrator for East Asia at that time. He chose
                    me to be his Deputy. John was quite an excellent person. He came from the family
                    of William Bullitt, the former Ambassador to Moscow who was his uncle. John was
                    part of a very successful New York law firm but had chosen to come into the
                    government because of his interest in development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was under which president?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: It was under Johnson. It was a Democratic administration at that time. As
                    you know, the Assistant Administrator jobs, and jobs more senior than that, are
                    presidential appointments and have to be cleared by the Senate, whereas the
                    Mission Director jobs, and the job I was taking at that time, Deputy Assistant
                    Administrator, were appointive jobs within AID. They did not have to go through
                    the Senate confirmation process.</p>
                <p>That was an exciting assignment, which extended from the middle of 1968 until the
                    early part of 1970, a little more than a year and a half. At that time the
                    Korean “miracle” was just becoming apparent. It started in about 1962 and by
                    1968 they were setting the world on fire with the rate of economic growth that
                    was going on there. Also, Taiwan had already become an AID graduate, as it's
                    called, because of its successful development, although we still had some
                    relationships with Taiwan though they were not an active AID recipient at that
                    time.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>The Philippines , Thailand , and the other East Asian countries that were in that
                    group, were other interesting cases but really quite different from the two
                    really spectacular success stories. Indonesia was a country that was going
                    through a particularly interesting time, coming out of the overthrow of Sukarno
                    in 1965 and the large-scale massacre of the communists that followed that.</p>
                <p>In 1967 the Suharto government had taken on a group of relatively young U.S.
                    trained economists to run the economic affairs of the government. They were
                    creating out of a very sluggish economy, one that had historically been doing
                    very poorly under Sukarno, they were trying to turn it around by adopting
                    sensible macro-economic policies with the help of the U.S. government and the
                    IMF, and encouragement from an international consortium of aid donors that
                    worked with them and met once a year to review their progress.</p>
                <p>In 1968 Indonesia was still pretty much at the bottom of turning things around
                    but their policies were good, and it set the stage for their later success. I
                    recall going out on a visit to Jakarta, the only one that I ever made actually,
                    at a time when they had zero exchange reserves. The system that they had adopted
                    was to auction off all available foreign exchange three times a week. As there
                    were some earnings from exports and so on, they would make them available to
                    exporters who would buy them at auctions. It was an absolutely open and free
                    exchange rate system set by the amount of money that was available. When people
                    say how much foreign exchange do you need to run an economy efficiently, my
                    answer based on the Indonesian experience is zero. If you are prepared to let
                    the exchange rate to find its equilibrium in the marketplace, you don't need any
                    foreign exchange to maintain the rate. You simply let the rate find its own
                    level. It was very successful for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's an area of success, I guess, the auction
                        process.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I believe that it was. Bob Barnett, who was the senior economist for the
                    State Department for East Asia, was very heavily involved in the Indonesian
                    economic policies. He and John Bullitt also spent a lot of time on

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a big program there in AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: We had a large program. I don't remember the dollar amounts but we were
                    also very important in helping mobilize the assistance of the other donors
                    through the consultative group process. Although this was one of the few
                    consultative groups where the Dutch, rather than the World Bank or the U.S., was
                    the head of the consultative group. The World Bank and the IMF usually are the
                    co-chairmen. But in this case the Dutch, because of their historic background in
                    Indonesia, were the head.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Yes. That was the beginning of a very impressive, but more gradual,
                    growth process that took place in Indonesia along the lines of the Korean model
                    but not as dramatic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we train those economists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: AID didn't. They were trained, a lot of them, at the University of
                    California at Berkeley, which happens to be my alma mater, although my training
                    was in engineering and theirs was in economics. They were known as the Berkeley
                    boys. Was that in Chile? I think that something like five out of six of the
                    senior economic managers in Indonesia, who were Ministers or in other important
                    economic positions, were trained at Berkeley.</p>
                <p>IR-8 rice was being developed at that time at the International Rice Institute in
                    the Philippines. There are a number of interesting stories from that East Asia
                    experience. I don't know how much time we have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we have time to tell them. Go ahead.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: At that time the Rice Institute and the Wheat Institute in Mexico had
                    support from the Rockefeller and the Ford Foundations to help get them started.
                    Since the Philippines Rice Institute was in our East Asia area, we were aware of
                    what was going on there. But it was generally AID policy not to support an
                    institution unless there was some indigenous financial support for it, that
                    could be seen as sustaining it over the long run. That theory is basically sound
                    or otherwise you get an institution that is a permanent dependency on donor aid.
                    AID had had a poor experience with institutes in Latin America that were founded
                    in the fifties and operated successfully until the foreign funding ran out and
                    then they collapsed because there was no indigenous funding to support them.</p>
                <p>When I first came into AID it was taboo to support a Servicio, as they were
                    called. They were usually related to rural development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. They were sort of shadow government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: They had a bad reputation, not because they didn't work well, but because
                    they weren't able to be integrated into the government after the foreign aid
                    stopped. They were external to the government system.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>For that reason AID wasn't supporting the Rice Institute. But John Bullitt saw
                    the potential of this thing and decided, under his own authority as Assistant
                    Administrator, that he would give them, I believe it was a half million dollar
                    grant one year. That really began AID's support for the International
                    Agricultural Institute.</p>
                <p>John Hannah became AID Administrator in 1969. He was also very supportive of the
                    Agriculture Research Institutes and began the process that led to the
                    International Contortium that now provides support to them on a regular basis.
                    And it is true, of course - AID's original supposition was correct - that they
                    continue to require outside foreign funding, but in this case the results have
                    been so phenomenal that the outside financiers, like AID, have been willing to
                    continue to fund them almost indefinitely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is a large group of countries supporting them
                        now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: There is a large group of countries, and I believe they have 10 or 12
                    institutes instead of the original two. I don't think any have been as
                    successful as the original successes of the Rice and the Wheat Institutes,
                    however.</p>
                <p>There's always a question of whether it is desirable to bring outsiders into AID
                    or should it rely on people in-house? My feeling is that both work or don't work
                    depending on the individuals involved. But in this case John was an example of
                    someone, being an outsider who could stand up to, or be more willing to defy, an
                    Agency policy in a constructive way. He wasn't as bound by the bureaucratic
                    constraints as the career people might have been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that is a good example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Another interesting thing at that time was that Vietnam was being run, as
                    a separate Bureau within AID. It was not part of the East Asia Bureau that I was
                    working with because the program had gotten so big in Vietnam that it was set up
                    as a separate Bureau. Jim Grant was running the Vietnam Bureau separately. But
                    the East Asia Bureau was involved to the extent that some of the projects were
                    influenced by the war in Vietnam. For example, there was a regional program
                    supported by the White House, under the Johnson administration, who had
                    appointed Eugene Black to be the head of some sort of regional working group,
                    which was supported by AID staff that were part of the East Asia Bureau. The
                    Regional program included planning for the development of the Mekong River. The
                    centerpiece of that program was a dam on the Mekong River that was planned to be
                    built between Thailand and Laos. This quite large hydro-electric dam was the
                    subject of a study to determine its economic feasibility. I believe we spent ten
                    million dollars on that study over the course of a couple of years.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>This was all part of the efforts of Lyndon Johnson to try to lure the North
                    Vietnamese into peaceful development instead of fighting in Vietnam. I thought
                    that, even at the time, it was a naive approach since the North Vietnamese
                    interest was the reunification of their country. To think that they might be
                    lured away from that objective by economic incentives was not very
                    realistic.</p>
                <p>There was one dam built under the auspices of the Regional Program. It was called
                    the Nam Ngum dam, in Laos. It was a much smaller dam. It cost about 30 million
                    dollars to build, I believe. It was built in an area that was very insecure as
                    far as the military situation was concerned. There was actually fighting going
                    on in Laos in many parts of the country at that time. The North Vietnamese and
                    Communist Pathet Lao let the dam be built. Of course they were very smart to do
                    so because ultimately they took over the country, and now they have the dam. It
                    generates power which I believe was supposed to be sold to Thailand, and
                    probably still is being sold to Thailand today. I heard recently that it is
                    still operating successfully and is part of their infrastructure. It had no
                    effect whatsoever in keeping them from their principal objective of reuniting
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>There were a series of other programs having to do with development of the area
                    on a regional basis, such as regional training in agricultural subjects and so
                    on. I recall there was always a lot of tension between John Bullitt on the one
                    hand, who saw the naivete of some of this activity and the kind of political
                    support that gave it some degree of sanctity regardless of the normal economic
                    considerations that would have come into play in deciding whether to go ahead
                    with these programs or not. But some of them were good programs in their own
                    light or certainly not harmful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ... On this question of naivete and whose view and what
                        was it...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: The Regional Program was thought of as doing two things: one, to lure the
                    North Vietnamese away from war, which of course was totally unsuccessful. The
                    other was creating some solidarity among the non-Communist countries in the
                    region by getting them to work together on regional programs.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>NOOTER: Yes, I guess so, but the level of those economic and technical programs
                    really had very little influence at the political level. But as I say, they may
                    have had some validity on their own as development programs. One was a regional
                    agricultural training program. I think the objective was to have one project
                    located in each country and that particular one was located in the Philippines.
                    I remember it because I visited and talked with the people at the university
                    that ran the program. The point was to have non-Filipinos come to this training
                    center, but whether that was any economic advantage or not is dubious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the motivating factor in terms of having the program
                        at all was still very political in its origins?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Yes, absolutely. As I said, it was supported by Eugene Black appointed by
                    the White House to give it some non-bureaucratic stature and to give it some
                    protection from the “bureaucrats” who might have otherwise treated it less
                    kindly. During the past year I was invited to and attended a reunion of the
                    people involved in that program. There was a mission established in Thailand
                    called the REDSO — Regional Economic Development Office, I believe. Lee St.
                    Lawrence was in charge of the REDSO office in Thailand and Tom Niblock was the
                    AID Office Director in Washington. Tom had a reunion of all of the people
                    involved in the program recently. It was quite interesting to go over some of
                    the old history. They did create a sense of loyalty for the people who worked on
                    the program.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I guess you'd have to look at that in the longer run and I haven't worked
                    in Asia much after 1975. Some of those programs may have survived. There is
                    still the political organization in southeast Asia that was formed at that time
                    whose acronym I don't remember. I think Vietnam was asked to join it recently,
                    which shows how times change.</p>

                <p>NOOTER: ASEAN, yes. The Regional Program was sort of an economic counterpart to
                    or under ASEAN's influence or auspices in some way. I guess it had some marginal
                    effect, but I would hesitate to say it turned the world around. It certainly
                    didn't have any effect on the primary political and military issues in the
                    area.</p>

                        Do you recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Thailand was a moderately successful economic developer at that time, not
                    as successful as later. A couple of interesting things about Thailand: one thing
                    was they had always been a major rice exporter, and they were one of the few
                    countries that I ever observed that was able to anticipate that the high export
                    earnings that would come from the occasional rice shortages in the world would
                    not last, and they were very conservative with their foreign exchange. This
                    served them very well because they avoided the “Uruguay” effect of using their
                    periods of high export earnings in a way that would then lock them into high
                    rates of expenditure when those earnings went down. I thought there was an irony
                    involved when the U.S. government got involved with their policies. At this time
                    they had a fairly good foreign exchange reserve balance, and the U.S. Government
                    encouraged them to spend their foreign exchange on development less
                    conservatively than they were doing. My own counsel on that subject was that we
                    should be cautious about turning them away from what had served them very well
                    over a long period of time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any sense of why they were so much more
                        prudent than other countries? Was there something special about the
                        situation there that obviously has led to economic success
                        subsequently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I guess it was something either in the durability of the bureaucracy that
                    had observed these phenomena over a long period of time or just the individuals
                    involved, but their style was to be conservative and prudent in the management
                    of their foreign exchange.</p>
                <p>One of the major issues in Thailand at that time was that there was a Communist
                    insurgency in the northeast, in particular in the poorer parts of the country.
                    We were attempting to provide some type of assistance such as for rural
                    development that would help that part of the country to develop in a way that
                    would make it less susceptible to communist insurgency. I don't know how
                    successful any of those programs were. I do remember visiting in some of the
                    villages and finding a curious mixture of Thai friendliness on the one hand and
                    also a sense that some part of the village was boycotting the visit and was
                    probably sympathetic to the insurgents.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>There was one other program that I remember approving at the time that I guess is
                    worth telling the story about because I think there are some implicit aid
                    lessons involved. One of the programs that was approved within our region was a
                    health program related to cholera. There was a proposal that a new anti-cholera
                    vaccine that had been developed by CDC (the Center for Disease Control in
                    Atlanta) under an AID grant, would be field-tested in what was then East
                    Pakistan for its applicability for wide-spread use. I remember reviewing that
                    program at some length over a considerable period of time because the
                    preliminary indications weren't all that positive about the effectiveness of the
                    vaccine. I finally approved it and it apparently went forward and I forgot about
                    it. This was in about 1968 when I first came to work for John Bullitt. It was
                    supposed to be a five-year field testing program in a health center in East
                    Pakistan located in the middle of a high-cholera incidence area, which was an
                    excellent place to test cholera in any of its forms. I forgot about this
                    entirely for many years until in 1975 I paid a visit to what was then
                    Bangladesh, after East Pakistan had become independent in 1971. It was part of
                    my area of responsibility at the time, and on one of my visits out there the
                    mission arranged a field visit to this center. I had completely forgotten about
                    it for many years until we approached it by boat. As we were taking the boat to
                    the center and they were explaining to me what the center did, I recalled that
                    this was the place where the cholera vaccine that I had approved for field
                    testing was to be tested. We arrived at a rather modest building where there
                    were two U.S. doctors who were in charge of the program. Although this was seven
                    years later rather than five, they had just completed the course of testing and
                    were beginning to summarize the results.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was still under an AID program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: This was still under an AID-financed program. As I reviewed the cost
                    later, I found that it had cost about five times as much as the original
                    estimate. Anyway, the senior doctor there was going over the results with me and
                    said that the vaccine was not effective. The results from its use were that it
                    didn't really improve resistance to cholera whatsoever, and they were going to
                    recommend against its use. But he also went on the explain the other programs
                    they had been carrying out along with this testing program - 8 or 10 other kinds
                    of field tests. As long as they were there, they were doing these other things
                    as well. And one of them was the oral rehydration treatment for cholera which
                    they had had phenomenal success with. He quoted what most of the people in the
                    aid and the health business are aware of, that with these oral rehydration
                    techniques the cure from cholera is almost 100%. This was an extremely happy
                    outcome of the program, and it is now in wide use. UNICEF has taken it up and
                    spread its use widely around the world. But I thought what was interesting was,
                    had I followed my original instincts and disapproved the original vaccine
                    because it didn't look promising, as it turned out not to be, the oral
                    rehydration may have never been developed. You can make what you want of that,
                    but I thought it was an interesting story.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is quite interesting and it proves that there is
                        often a positive fall-out that one doesn't anticipate from pursuing
                        something of that sort. Do you remember who the doctor was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: No I don't, and I remember when I came back and told our health people
                    that the vaccine was ineffective they wouldn't believe me because they hadn't
                    received the official reports yet, and they were still very positive about it.
                    Ultimately I'm sure they found it to be the case.</p>
                <p>Another story of a similar kind is about Korea. I remember visiting Korea in
                    connection with my new assignment in East Asia. After having worked in Liberia
                    where having a success in any kind of program was extremely difficult, it was a
                    marvel to go to Korea and find the way the Koreans were picking up and running
                    with any new information or new technology that came their way. I remember we
                    had a very senior AID person who had been a university president and was
                    extremely knowledgeable on education, health and all the social services. He was
                    posted in one of the ministries - I forget which one, probably education. And he
                    was our adviser on all the social science subjects for the Government of Korea.
                    The Koreans would come to see him. They would talk with him and he would give
                    them ideas and they would take them and implement them. I'm sure we had other
                    staff there too doing some things, but he was like a one-man consulting service
                    for virtually all the social services. The responsiveness of the Koreans to the
                    advice he was giving says something about what it takes to make aid work.</p>

                <p>NOOTER: Nancy may remember it because we met them when he was going to go to
                    Nigeria. In fact they did go to Nigeria where his family had a tragic accident
                    where they lost both of their sons within a year, one in Nigeria and one in the
                    United States.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: That's it. The real wonder was not the man, however, but the Koreans'
                    response to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you characterize why that occurred in Korea and
                        wouldn't in other places?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>NOOTER: At that time the Koreans were in the full flush of their economic success
                    story. I think something happens in a country when the growth rate goes up to a
                    certain level - people get very excited. Also, maybe the Koreans are dynamic and
                    industrious, although I knew the Koreans through my war experience in 1951-52 in
                    an entirely different setting. The ones I saw during the war were rural,
                    traditional, hide-bound laborers. Of course the economy in the Japanese
                    occupation days was thought of as being run entirely by Japanese managers and so
                    the Koreans hadn't been trained as managers. But when they began to have some
                    success, which was apparent as early as 1964 I think, the whole country - well,
                    I shouldn't say the whole country because I'm sure there were still conservative
                    pockets, particularly in the rural areas, but a large part of the country - got
                    very excited and began finding they could accomplish things and achieve things
                    and do things if they put out effort, and that there would be rewards for doing
                    so. That was what was going on in the country at the time. It was quite
                    fascinating.</p>
                <p>Two stories about Korea that have some relevance. I remember talking with my
                    Deputy about Korea when I was running the Vietnam Bureau later, as to what
                    projects that had been successful and what weren't successful. He had been
                    involved in Korea in the '50s, and there had been a program to help Korean
                    entrepreneurs to set up small businesses. AID had financed 100 or 150 small
                    businesses in the late 1950s, and my deputy said he was there at that time.
                    Every one of those businesses failed in the economic environment of the 1950s,
                    and with the lack of experience, not having been managers and so on, every one
                    of those businesses failed. But in the '60s, many of the successful managers
                    that emerged then were people who had been involved in the failed businesses in
                    the '50s. So sometimes the time and effort we spend in human resource
                    development pays off if it can be in the right context, in the right
                    macroeconomic context.</p>
                <p>The other Korean story that might be of some interest is that the Korean
                    turnaround started, of course, under President Park. He took over the Government
                    in a coup in 1961 and his first attempt at straightening out the economy failed.
                    I can't remember the details of the policy mix but it wasn't a good mix and
                    there were no results. It was only in 1962 when they took a second try at a
                    different policy mix that the success took place. That success and those efforts
                    took place not under the promise of more U.S. aid but under the threat of less
                    U.S. aid. That threat, not intended as a threat but simply as a warning, came
                    from the ambassador at that time, Sam Berger, who went to Park and said that the
                    U.S. was giving something like $300 million worth of aid in balance of payments
                    support every year to keep Korea afloat. He simply warned the president that the
                    political situation in the United States was such that that was not going to
                    continue indefinitely, and Korea was going to have to learn to stand on its own
                    two feet. It was the result of those conversations that led Park to decide he
                    had to take some measures that would straighten out the economy and put it on a
                    growth track. And as I said, first unsuccessfully and second successfully. Today
                    we usually try offering increased aid if countries will follow the correct
                    policies. So I always think of this as a story with a different message.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had been providing very substantial amounts of
                        assistance of all kinds to Korea up to that point. Did you get any sense of
                        what the results of that were or whether it was having, maybe not motivating
                        the president, but did you get any sense of its impact on the economy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: When we get to the end we'll be talking a little about what is successful
                    or not successful. It's very difficult to measure how much of these successes
                    come out of what AID has done and what comes for other reasons. I'm sure what
                    AID did in terms of human resource development, and I refer again to the story
                    about entrepreneurs, had some bearing on their ability to function in the new
                    environment. However, some of the studies that I read later over the years about
                    what made Korea successful claim that it was because the land-holding pattern
                    was such that there was not a rich and poor class but a fairly equitable
                    distribution of resources at the beginning of development. Others will say it
                    was because the Japanese foreign investment that came in at the time gave an
                    enormous stimulation to the economy.</p>
                <p>I say it was probably all of these things, but it was mainly a macroeconomic
                    setting where a realistic exchange rate was established, the policies of the
                    government were to encourage investment, and at least in the initial phases they
                    did not make mistakes about investing in steel mills when they should have been
                    investing in something else. That was reflected in the statistics of the 60's.
                    Economists measure capital output ratios, that is, how much additional output
                    does an economy generate compared to how much capital has been invested in that
                    period. A three-to-one capital output ratio - that is, if you get one unit of
                    additional output for three units of investment when you view the overall
                    economy - that is considered quite good. In Africa now you might be lucky to get
                    one unit of output for five, or infinity in some cases.</p>
                <p>In Korea it was as low as one-to-two for several years in the 1960s. It was
                    because they were investing in light technology such as electronics, that is,
                    foreign investors were coming in and setting up electronics assembly plants and
                    so on where they could use Korean workers who were able to be trained as skilled
                    workers, but with a small investment in equipment and in plant and a high labor
                    content, so that the return the economy generated on the amount of investment
                    was extremely large. Incidentally this was the subject of my paper even in 1968
                    in the Senior Seminar. It related to the importance of watching the capital
                    output ratio and the efficiency of the production system, and having
                    macroeconomic policies that promote efficient production.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this was a labor force that was both highly or
                        reasonably well skilled at relatively low cost?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: You can't say they were skilled in the sense that they had done this kind
                    of work before.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, had an educational base...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: They must have had sufficient education in the system that they could be
                    trained. And they're sufficiently industrious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And their costs were relatively low compared to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: At that time, of course, it was a very underdeveloped economy, and in all
                    underdeveloped economies the labor costs are very low. So the surge that took
                    place came out of good macroeconomic policies mixed with some infusion of
                    foreign investment that brought with it technology and capital for investing in
                    productive resources, sound government policies regarding how it used its own
                    resources, and a productive labor force that was able to be mobilized. And then
                    success piled on top of success. Once the Koreans saw what they could do, they
                    began to be highly motivated to achieve even more. Also, then skilled Koreans
                    who had been working abroad in the United States and so on began going back to
                    Korea and adding to the human resource base instead of having the flow of travel
                    people going the other way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any of those policies, industrial and agricultural
                        policies and whatever ... can you associate with AID's role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I'm sure that you can. I remember one story that perhaps gives a clue
                    that we, in that earlier period, might have had something to do with coaching
                    them along on a sound basis, although my association didn't start there until
                    1968.</p>
                <p>In about 1969, a group of Koreans came to Washington to try to convince us to
                    support them financially with the building of a steel mill . I spent some time
                    looking into that. At that time, it was thought that the minimum size of a steel
                    mill that would be economic was about a million tons of production a year. I
                    believe the technology now is totally different, but this is what it was at that
                    time. And Korea's total steel consumption at that time was 400,000 tons. Of
                    course one steel mill can't produce all sizes and shapes and kinds and so it
                    seemed ridiculous to think that Korea should be going ahead with a steel mill at
                    that time. Also, we had some very bad experiences in some other countries such
                    as Turkey with steel mills that were uneconomic and very capital intensive, and
                    that turned out to be very poor investments for the countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>And so we were not about to be persuaded to help finance the steel mill. The
                    Koreans were absolutely shocked that we weren't prepared to help them, but
                    ultimately became convinced that we weren't. In due course they went to the
                    Japanese who ultimately did finance the steel mill. And I remember doing a
                    little back-of-the-envelope calculation at that time that indicated that if they
                    put the same amount of money into the kind of light manufacturing that they were
                    so successful at instead of the steel mill, their growth rate would be two
                    percent higher a year over a period of five or ten years than it would be by
                    putting it in the steel mill. Well, they went ahead with the steel mill anyway.
                    But of course it takes some years to build a steel mill, and by the time it was
                    built the economy was growing at such a rapid rate that it turned out not to be
                    a bad investment after all. But fortunately, they were delayed somewhat in going
                    ahead with it, so by the time they finally got to it, it was not as bad an
                    investment as it would have been in an earlier period.</p>
                <p>One of the interesting things in both Taiwan and Korea, as I went back and
                    reviewed the history of both countries when they made the adjustment from
                    overvalued exchange rates and very serious current account deficits and so on,
                    was the shock medicine of a drastic devaluation associated with enormously high
                    interest rates for a limited period of time, where the interest rates on
                    borrowing would go up to something like 50% or 75% per annum and that same rate
                    would apply to deposits made in banks. In both cases, by working through a
                    drastic revision in the exchange rate and the monetary system, things were
                    brought back to normal fairly quickly. Once they'd absorbed the excessive
                    liquidity in the economy they could be brought back to normal. In both cases I
                    believe it took only about six months. And then the economy was put on a basis
                    that was more nearly at equilibrium. That shock treatment was an extremely
                    effective way, although most countries are afraid to undertake such drastic
                    medicine. I think the Swedes did something like that when they had their
                    economic crisis a couple of years ago. The same thing was done in some of the
                    former Soviet republics.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: The State Department was extremely cooperative and it was a very
                    excellent working relationship. Marshall Green was the Assistant Secretary at
                    that time and Bob Barnett, who was the senior economist for State in East Asia,
                    and John Bullitt were extremely good friends and colleagues working closely
                    together, principally on Indonesia because that was such a hot and difficult
                    topic, but not only on Indonesia. The relationship was really quite excellent.
                    It was one of the best, I think, anywhere in the world. That relationship is not
                    always easy, but it was good background for me to see how well it could work
                    when both sides are constructive and chose to spend time and effort working
                    together.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any particular line the State Department was
                        pushing, trying to persuade the AID program to follow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Their own economic views were what I would call extremely sensible. Of
                    course, AID isn't always sensible either, but we like to think that we are
                    sensible most of the time on economic matters. But State was also taking
                    extremely sensible positions on Korea, Indonesia, etc. As I said, in Korea it
                    was Sam Berger, the Ambassador, who really took the initiative with the
                    Government that said they had to get their policies together. Sam was a very
                    hard-charging, serious ambassador who was not interested in just placating the
                    political interests at the expense of economic interests. He saw the two as
                    being related and similar. We've had a few ambassadors like that who have been
                    quite - what shall I say - economic-minded. William Macomber, who was Ambassador
                    in Turkey, led the phase-out of aid in Turkey rather than the usual political
                    line that it's necessary to keep aid going to keep the relationship going. He
                    took the view that Turkey no longer needed aid and it should be phased out, and
                    the relationship would be just as good or better without it. The phase-out in
                    Turkey really was, I believe, largely stimulated from Macomber's side. As in
                    Korea where the pressure to adjust to lower aid levels came from Sam Berger.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Marshall Green was also very realistic on economic issues. This is a little ahead
                    of our discussion, but when Richard Nixon first became President and made his
                    first trip to Asia, he went with Marshall. The notion of the U.S. playing a more
                    restrained role in the world, which became a Nixon policy coming out of those
                    first few months in office, was really a Marshall Green idea, I believe. And of
                    course, Nixon was able to pick it up, but I believe that the notion that
                    countries had to do more for themselves and rely less on the U.S. came from
                    Marshall. I remember the incidents and the communiqu�s, and the discussions I
                    observed at the time. We had a very responsible and sensible group of State
                    Department people, and hopefully the same on the AID side and this led to a good
                    working relationship. Regarding the Philippines, I remember being amazed that
                    this country wasn't doing better because at that time, as I remember, they had
                    about 30 million Filipinos and 1 million of them were in institutions of higher
                    education - actually in school at that time. The amount of trained people in the
                    Philippines at that time was enormous. Some of those in school may have been at
                    junior colleges or whatever, and the quality of the education may not have been
                    great, but anybody who thinks that you can achieve development only by human
                    resource development should look at the Philippines. Certainly it's an essential
                    ingredient, but it's not the only ingredient. Somehow the Philippine policies
                    were able to thwart the successful development of that country for many years,
                    even with a nation of highly trained people. One of the inhibitions at that time
                    was the enormous division of wealth between the ostentatiously wealthy and the
                    extraordinarily poverty-stricken part of the population. The difference was
                    enormous, and I think the wealthy did not have an incentive to invest in the
                    kinds of investment that would lead to effective development. I had occasion to
                    visit the Philippines a few years ago and I thought the situation had changed
                    enormously. There still is, of course, a wealthy group, but it's much less
                    concentrated. There is much more of a middle class. They're slowly evolving out
                    of that huge gap between the overwhelmingly rich and the poor, and I think now
                    the Philippines may be ready to become a growth case like its neighbors,
                    especially under the better policies that they've been following in the last
                    couple of years. When Nixon came into office, John Bullitt left the government
                    and Rod O'Connor took his place as Assistant Administrator. I stayed on as
                    Deputy Assistant Administrator under Rod. There's just one incident that I'll
                    tell because it's both instructive and maybe somewhat amusing. At that time, as
                    there have been many times before and many times since, there was enormous White
                    House pressure to do something effective about drug smuggling into the United
                    States. We received a cable from Thailand from the Embassy where there was a
                    report that two nationalist Chinese generals who had private armies in northwest
                    Thailand involved in the opium-smuggling trade had indicated to a senior
                    official in the Thai government that they were getting on in years and wanted to
                    retire from the business. The only problem was that they had a stock of opium
                    that they needed to dispose of — this was 26 tons of raw opium that was in their
                    possession. They said that if the U.S. government would buy this opium from
                    them, they would agree to get out of the business and settle their troops in
                    villages along the border between Thailand and Burma and become a kind of
                    barrier to future smugglers who might be inclined to come that way. And they
                    promised to become peaceful farmers and no longer be involved in the drug
                    business. But it would take $2,000,000 to buy up this quantity of opium.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>The White House had appointed a drug czar, one of many over the years, who was
                    working out of the White House, and had read this cable and was very excited
                    about it. Rod and I were highly skeptical, and we went back to the Embassy with
                    some questions such as, “If they wanted to get out of the drug business, why
                    didn't they just get out of it?” and, “Why did they need to have somebody buy
                    this opium from them.” The Embassy explained that they owed their suppliers for
                    the opium. They had bought it on consignment and they had to pay off the people
                    that had sold it to them, and that's why they had to be paid so they could pay
                    off these people. We took the view from an economic perspective that buying up a
                    supply of anything only creates more of a market for it and therefore will
                    generate more supply. And though this deal was supposed to have the extra
                    advantage of getting these people out of the business, which we had serious
                    doubts about, the supply gap would soon be filled by somebody else coming
                    forward with other opium.</p>
                <p>But the White House insisted on going ahead with it. After Rod's serious attempt
                    to keep this from happening, AID was required to put up $2,000,000 to buy this
                    opium. There was some discussion about whether the opium could be used for drug
                    manufacture in the United States for legitimate purposes, but for some reason
                    that was found not to be feasible. So the opium was to be destroyed out in
                    Thailand, but we would send some people out to be sure that it was destroyed.
                    When we first suggested sending some people up to see the opium and to examine
                    this and see where the Chinese nationalists would be resettled, we were told
                    that it was simply too unsafe, it really wouldn't be feasible to send anyone up
                    there, we couldn't see the area and just had to take their word for it. And the
                    money was to be delivered by a Thai general who was a close friend of the United
                    States and someone we were supposed to trust, and delivered in greenbacks.
                    Ultimately that's exactly what happened.</p>
                <p>Two million dollars, in what I presume was a satchel (I never saw it) of cash
                    money was turned over to a general named Kriangsak, who later either became
                    Prime Minister or was very senior in the Thai government to deliver. We did get
                    an agreement that two people from the U.S. Customs Office would go to see that
                    the opium was burned. And these two chaps did go up - I saw a report on it - and
                    saw this pile of opium. I've always had my own vision of what that must have
                    been like, or what position the Customs officials must have been in, with some
                    1300 Nationalist Chinese soldiers in this armed militia surrounding these
                    fellows, and they're pointing to the pile and saying “There it is, do you want
                    to sample it?” And these fellows saying “Well, that's all right, fellows. Go
                    ahead and burn it.” In any event, they reported that it had been burned and the
                    $2,000,000 was delivered. Then in the successive months we heard by the
                    grapevine and through our various sources, that what was burned was mainly cow
                    dung, and to my knowledge the generals never did get out of the business which
                    went on much as before.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>The one thing that AID did get out of it was that, in the course of the heated
                    discussions and arguments that went on about the purchase, we got agreement that
                    although it would be done in this case, the notion that preemptive purchase was
                    a bad policy was firmly established, and we did get a commitment from all of the
                    people involved in this that in the future, preemptive purchases would not be
                    indulged in. I don't know how long that lasted, but I think it did help to
                    establish that as a sound policy within the government. And to my knowledge we
                    never had any other such attempts. This was a case where the political pressure
                    to produce some results in the United States for the anti-drug campaign led to
                    some fairly ridiculous actions on the part of the U.S. government.</p>
                <p>John Hannah took over as AID Administrator in 1969. John was an extremely fine
                    man and AID was extremely fortunate to have him named as the AID Administrator.
                    John Hannah had been interested in the AID program for many many years, when he
                    was President of Michigan State. He had been involved in various kinds of
                    programs for which Michigan State was a contractor to AID and was thoroughly
                    knowledgeable about aid. John also had the fortuitous view that most of the AID
                    operations should be run by AID professionals who knew the business, and with
                    the exception of a congressional liaison person and an administrative person, I
                    believe without exception all of his Presidential appointment positions were
                    filled by AID career people.</p>
                <p>Appointment as Assistant Administrator for Vietnam - 1970</p>
                <p>John Hannah came to AID early in 1969, and somewhere around the latter part of
                    1969, he offered me a position as Assistant Administrator to run the Vietnam
                    operation since Jim Grant was departing. I accepted in spite of the fact that I
                    had serious reservations about the U.S. Government's Vietnam policy at that
                    time. It seemed to me obvious that the people of the United States weren't
                    prepared to support that war anymore, and our best policy was to get out.
                    However, it was the Nixon administration's policy to withdraw from Vietnam, and
                    therefore I thought I could work on the Vietnam program in good conscience. I
                    didn't think it was a bad idea that we would give the South Vietnamese, who had
                    taken a lot of their current positions because of the U.S. role, a chance to run
                    things themselves if they could, if they had proper equipment and training.
                    Therefore turning the war over to them in an orderly way in a reasonable period
                    of time was a sound policy and one that I could support.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>So with that in mind, I accepted the job as Assistant Administrator for Vietnam.
                    I started working on it about February 1970, although my clearance and
                    confirmation process still had to go forward, but I nevertheless began running
                    the program. Just a word on the confirmation process might be interesting. In
                    all administrations Presidential appointments had to go through the White House.
                    Some administrations took that down even to mission director and lower level
                    positions, but in any event all of them required political clearance for
                    Presidential appointments because that had to go through the Senate and be
                    cleared, among others, with the Congressmen in the states where these people
                    came from. So my nomination went forward sent by John Hannah. John had two
                    presidential appointment selections that were not career, but because he was
                    relying so much on the career staff, he was having trouble getting his
                    clearances through the White House, who wanted to put a number of political
                    appointees into the system. To my experience the Nixon administration was not as
                    insistent on this as the Kennedy administration, and the Johnson administration
                    was quite good on career people also. I thought that actually the Kennedy
                    administration was more political than either of the other two.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting because certainly the Johnson
                        administration was very supportive of the bureaucracy and the staff of
                        professionals and career people. The Nixon administration in my exposure to
                        it was much more political, and pushed much further down the line in terms
                        of being sure people were political.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Now that you remind me, it got more political the longer the
                    administration went on. Now most administrations are the most political up
                    front, then become less political during their tenure. But in the Nixon
                    administration, maybe they were just a little bit sloppy at first, but they were
                    fairly loose at the beginning, then toward the end it became more difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I got caught up in the subsequent period I guess...lower
                        levels.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: In any event, when they looked at my background, of course I had come in
                    at a fairly high level in the Kennedy administration, and my whole record didn't
                    look so politically pure to the White House. So they held it up for some time,
                    and finally after about six months of John Hannah pushing and pushing trying to
                    get it through, a senior political person, I think his name was Bell, in the
                    White House, called me up one day. He said they were reviewing the request for
                    my clearance and he asked how I had voted in the 1968 election. I didn't
                    hesitate very long before I told him that I had voted for Hubert Humphrey,
                    thinking this was pretty much the end of my appointment. For whatever reason, my
                    nomination was approved the next day. Now a lot of things happen in the
                    government that I don't understand, but this is one of the most puzzling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe he already knew who you voted for, or thought you
                        were an honest man.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>NOOTER: I don't know whether he gave me credit for honesty or what. I don't know,
                    but for whatever reason he approved it, and it went on up to the Senate and I
                    was approved with no particular problem.</p>
                <p>The Vietnam operation was enormous. I think we had some 2200 people in that
                    Bureau either in Washington or the field, most of them of course in Vietnam. AID
                    provided staff for two kinds of programs. One was the more or less regular
                    economic programs: agriculture, various kinds of technical assistance, and
                    infrastructure programs. The other program was the staff that we provided to the
                    CORDS organization in Vietnam. CORDS was a mixed military/civilian operation and
                    it was headed up by someone in Vietnam who reported to the ambassador. He was
                    not under the military and he was not directly under AID although roughly half
                    of his personnel came from AID. AID wasn't directly responsible for the CORDS
                    operation in the field, but we nevertheless kept an oversight of it and were
                    kept informed about it, and played some role in it. It also did link to some
                    extent with the more traditional AID programs that we had such as in agriculture
                    and refugees because the CORDS people in the field would be actually involved in
                    working on some of these programs in the field.</p>
                <p>During the course of the next several years the staff size came down immensely. I
                    don't remember the exact numbers, but we were in a phase-down mode. I think we
                    had 400 people in Washington when I first started and in a couple of years we
                    reduced that to less than half, and the same in the field. I don't remember the
                    exact numbers. As I mentioned, the policy of the government at that time was
                    that we were in a withdrawal mode, that we were helping the Vietnamese get on
                    their own feet to take over the war in a military way, and we were trying to
                    help them straighten out their economy with the notion that the U.S. would
                    withdraw in some period of time.</p>
                <p>I ran the program from 1970 to 1974 when AID reorganized, and I'll get to that
                    later. It was run as a separate Bureau until 1972, at which time the program had
                    been reduced in size to the point where there was a reorganization and all the
                    programs that were funded with what was called Supporting Assistance were merged
                    into a single region. At that time it included Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and also
                    a program in Jordan . I don't think we had a program in Israel yet, but if we
                    did that also would have been included.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was an economic support bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: It was called the Supporting Assistance Bureau. It administered the money
                    that had a political motive — an economic purpose but a political motive — and
                    it was a separate line item in the foreign aid bill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was not regionally oriented?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>NOOTER: It was not regionally oriented. It was administered on a world-wide
                    basis, but the only areas we were involved in at that time were southeast Asia
                    and a little bit of it to the Middle East. Then occasional bits of Supporting
                    Assistance went to other places such as Malta under a base agreement that I'll
                    talk about later.</p>
                <p>But between 1970 and 1972, which is the period that I'll cover first, I was
                    running just the Vietnam program. Of course what I found when I started going to
                    Vietnam on visits, and I did visit every part of that country over the next
                    several years, was that the atmosphere was dominated by the U.S. military upbeat
                    style which doesn't really brook the thought of defeat. While there was no
                    explicit rule about this, one quickly got the sense that things were off limits.
                    It was simply an unspoken atmosphere which partly, I guess from my own military
                    experience and partly from experience in general, I sensed immediately when I
                    came out to Vietnam. Things that were thought of as going badly or not working
                    maybe could be mentioned but always in the context of how they could be improved
                    to make them work, never in the context of the fact that you shouldn't be doing
                    them at all. And this led to unreality in some parts of the Vietnam program.
                    When people go back and wonder what happened, this atmosphere, which has a lot
                    to be said for it in a situation where you are winning, was one of the reasons
                    that created some unrealistic situations. I thought the Best and the Brightest
                    by David Halberstam and A Bright and Shining Lie by Neil Sheehan capture this
                    very well.</p>
                <p>I also met John Vann, who was almost a larger than life character, very well
                    described in the Neil Sheehan book. I don't know if the audience to this oral
                    history will know who he was, but he was a military man who had been in Vietnam
                    up until 1963, I believe as a Lieutenant Colonel. John became an outspoken
                    critic of the tactics that were being used in Vietnam because he thought they
                    were ineffective. He resigned from the military as a protest. He had been a
                    close friend of Daniel Ellsberg, who released the Pentagon papers. And John left
                    Vietnam and the military in protest to the policies, and became an outspoken
                    critic of the program. He worked for Martin Marietta for two years, and then was
                    hired by AID in about 1965 and went back to Vietnam as a civilian in the CORDS
                    program.</p>
                <p>By this time he had some audience of people who listened to the things that he
                    said, and he did have some influence on the policies at the time and caused them
                    to become more effective. But ultimately, John also was committed to helping the
                    South Vietnamese to prevail. I think John never could quite accept that the
                    South Vietnamese weren't going to prevail as a separate entity from the
                    North.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>But anyway, he was quite a charismatic character, and in many ways very unlike me
                    but oddly we hit it off very well. And I must say I learned a lot from John. I
                    went on tours of the countryside with him in his area. At the time I came out he
                    was in charge of the CORDS program in the Delta. There were four regions of the
                    country, and he was in charge of the Delta region. I remember I shocked him and
                    all of his staff when I first went down to the Delta. They began doing what was
                    standard procedure there, which was to take you into a Quonset type hut and give
                    you a military-type briefing with statistics of what was going on. And after the
                    first briefing I said to John, “No more briefings on this trip, John,” because I
                    felt I wasn't seeing anything. I was seeing the inside of a Quonset hut and
                    seeing some figures, but I wasn't seeing the countryside, I wasn't seeing the
                    people, I wasn't getting a feeling for what was really going on. And so while
                    that threw the schedule into a turmoil initially, John could appreciate my
                    response, and he spent the rest of the tour showing the Delta to me in quite a
                    different way.</p>
                <p>He liked to take you in his helicopter, which he piloted himself most of the
                    time. The way to see how good the rice harvest was was to fly about 20 feet
                    above the houses in the helicopter and look down in the yards to see whether the
                    piles of rice in the yards was big or small. I had a lot of admiration for John,
                    his views and what he thought, and I learned a lot from him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He obviously had a very definite strategy he followed in
                        what he was trying to do. Can you describe that, what he was trying to bring
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I can't remember so many of the details about the program, but I think
                    for one thing the earlier policy had been to have villages that were encompassed
                    in barbed wire and were cut off from the surrounding country, making them into
                    enclaves. John didn't agree with that, among other things. He believed in his
                    CORDS people being out in the countryside and not simply letting the Viet Cong
                    take over at night, but being out where they could dominate the landscape at
                    night as well as in the daytime.</p>
                <p>I recall he disagreed very much with the Agent Orange program which was an
                    attempt to defoliate the forests so the Viet Cong couldn't hide in them. In
                    retrospect this was one of the most stupid things you could imagine doing, not
                    to mention the environmental effects that have come from it. He thought that it
                    was absurd, and was one of the few people to say so at the time. Other than
                    being enormously energetic and trying to get down to the grass roots and
                    understand what was really going on, and working with the people at the level
                    where they lived, I can't remember anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have a sense he was trying to understand the
                        Vietnamese frame of mind or attitude or culture?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>NOOTER: Yes, that would be true, and trying to support them and get them to take
                    the lead in running things and securing their own defense. Of course ultimately
                    I think he would have been unsuccessful had he lived. He died in a helicopter
                    crash just before the collapse. He was at that time in charge of II Corps, which
                    is where the North Vietnamese principal invasion came through. I always used to
                    say, half in jest, that Vietnam would never fall so long as John Vann was alive,
                    and in retrospect, that's about the way it went. It collapsed not so long after
                    John died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He wasn't responsible for all of the CORDS operation but
                        just one area, is that what you're saying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Actually, in his last tenure in II Corps, when the U.S. direct military
                    involvement had decreased and we had less U.S. military there, he was put in
                    charge of not only the CORDS people but all of the military people who were in
                    that Corps. That was considered kind of a revolution to have a civilian in
                    charge of military units, even though he'd been a former military officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, we can continue with Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Ellsworth Bunker was the Ambassador at the time that I was there, and he
                    was in charge of the CORDS program as well as the AID mission there. I found him
                    to be a most remarkable person. I guess he was about 76 at that time. He had the
                    natural instincts of the true administrator, to my mind. He never seemed to get
                    involved in unnecessary detail, but he always seemed to know the important
                    things that were going on and what to become involved in. He had an ability to
                    separate the wheat from the chaff in a way that was more profound than any
                    executive I'd seen. I thought he was also extremely sensible, level-headed, and
                    never had any illusions about the job that was there to be done, but also did
                    everything he could to carry out his assignments in the best possible way.</p>
                <p>Bill Colby was in charge of the CORDS program. He later became head of the CIA,
                    and we'll go into that some more later. Bill also was extremely reasonable and
                    sensible and good to work with. But as I say, nobody wanted to hear anything out
                    there about how things weren't working or how they might not succeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That included Colby and Bunker too?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>NOOTER: Less so, but it permeated the whole atmosphere. I recall as the
                    withdrawal was going on, in 1972 I was out there on a visit and Colby had
                    arranged a dinner for his senior CORDS staff. There were about 20 of us sitting
                    around a table and at the end of the dinner I suggested we go around the table
                    and ask each person at the table what they thought would happen after the U.S.
                    withdrawal was complete. They did this, in this case in a very frank and open
                    fashion, and two things of note stand out: one, at that time both Colby and I
                    were reasonably optimistic about the chances of the South Vietnamese pulling it
                    off by themselves. But I noticed that the people who were the most pessimistic
                    were the ones at the lowest levels who were out in the countryside and had the
                    closest contact with the people. It was more possible to be optimistic in
                    headquarters than if you were out in the hamlets. And of course they were the
                    ones who were correct. The other thing was that after the meeting one of the
                    people at the dinner came up to me and said “This is the first frank and open
                    discussion I have ever heard in Vietnam the whole time I've been here.” I guess
                    maybe with the U.S. withdrawal having reached the stage where it was, it became
                    more acceptable to be open and candid. Colby had no reservations about this
                    openness whatsoever. It was not he who was imposing this lack of openness in the
                    prior period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the people from the lower levels who knew the
                        hamlets, what were they saying about the situation there being pessimistic —
                        what did pessimistic mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I can't remember the details, but I guess they were aware that while a
                    lot of Viet Cong had been killed in the TET offensive, the Viet Cong
                    sympathizers and the North Vietnamese were still there, they were in the
                    countryside, and once the U.S. pulled out they doubted the South Vietnamese
                    ability to pull it off, to retain the leadership.</p>
                <p>There was one incident that convinced me that it was going to fail, and that was
                    a military exercise later in 1972 when the U.S. by this time had fully trained
                    and equipped the South Vietnamese army. They were all ready to go and so the
                    U.S. military and the Vietnamese army planned an attack by the Vietnamese army
                    up near the 39th parallel to cut the Ho Chi Minh trail. They were to go in and
                    do that with some U.S. air support, but the ground forces were to be entirely
                    South Vietnamese. They would actually be going into Cambodia, I guess, and/or
                    Laos, but it would be Vietnamese troops.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>I happened to be up in Hue at the time, near the 39th parallel, when we got the
                    reports of what happened in that engagement. It was clear that the North
                    Vietnamese, when faced with a threat to the Ho Chi Minh trail, mounted a stiff
                    resistance that completely beat up the South Vietnamese troops, who left their
                    equipment and came running back across the border. I remember seeing General
                    Abrams, who was in charge of the U.S. military forces at that time, shortly
                    after that in Saigon. He was another realist. I liked Abrams very much, a very
                    sound fellow, which was certainly not true of all of the military that had been
                    there. He confided to me that the South Vietnamese had been soundly whipped. It
                    seemed to me that if they couldn't sustain themselves in the face of a real
                    confrontation with the North Vietnamese troops when they were fully armed and
                    equipped by the U.S. and still had U.S. air cover, they certainly weren't going
                    to do it after we left.</p>
                <p>In any event, we did spend a lot of time during '70, '71, and '72 on the economic
                    program. Charles Cooper was working in State on the economic program for AID and
                    State, and later went out to live in Saigon running the economic program on the
                    U.S. side. He was quite excellent.</p>
                <p>We had a good Vietnamese counterpart, the Minister of Economy, named Ngoc. He was
                    very sensible. I give the credit to Chuck Cooper and Ngoc, who developed a good
                    macroeconomic policy, where they devalued the exchange rate enormously, even
                    though this meant that temporarily it reduced the flow of U.S. financial
                    resources that the U.S. military had to pay for its operations there that were
                    being bought at an overvalued exchange rate. But nevertheless it was healthy for
                    the economy to change the exchange rate and put it on a sound basis. And believe
                    it or not, even with the war going on, the period following the TET offensive
                    was relatively stable, and the Vietnamese economy began to respond and we began
                    to get some good results. This came from the countryside, that is at the rural
                    level. But of course ultimately that got disrupted as the political and military
                    situation deteriorated.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: First Don McDonald and then Bob Mossler. They were both extremely capable
                    people. I think it was in that order. Anyway, those were the two in the time I
                    was there. They were both very competent and ran good programs.</p>

                <p>We had one interesting program there in the Mekong Delta. It is a rice-growing
                    area where rice is grown as the flood of the Mekong River recedes. Once the rice
                    crop is grown there's a dry season when nothing was grown traditionally until
                    the next flood. The AID mission introduced a crop of sorghum that could be grown
                    in the dry period, and within two or three years an enormous quantity, it seems
                    to me like several hundred thousand tons a year, of sorghum was grown in the
                    Mekong delta at a time when nothing had been grown before. I thought if one
                    wants to look for interesting and startling successes in the AID program, that
                    would be one example. I would be fascinated to know what happened now that the
                    North Vietnamese have taken over, whether that sorghum crop remains as a
                    cultivated crop. My guess is that it did but I don't know for sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, we were involved in doing any of the rice
                        developments at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Yes, we introduced the IR-8 rice variety. We spread the use of IR-8 rice,
                    but that was already in place when I took over. I think the big issues had to do
                    with the pricing of rice, the availability of rice markets, and how the South
                    Vietnamese collected the rice. Sometimes the rice wouldn't come to market before
                    the exchange rate was devalued; prices were unduly depressed, and so the
                    government was inclined to go out and collect it at the point of a bayonet. We
                    argued that that was not a good way to run an economy.</p>
                <p>I think the issues related to rice at the time I was there were more related to
                    policy issues and marketing rather than technical issues. Part of the recovery
                    of the economy was in rice production. As the rice prices rose, more rice was
                    grown and came to market. If the price is reasonable, farmers will grow it and
                    sell it. But under wartime conditions, the South Vietnamese first instincts were
                    not to handle it on a market economy basis. But Minister Ngoc understood that
                    and agreed, and went along with us to implement the policies that brought things
                    around.</p>

                        of money. What were we doing mostly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: A lot of the program was what you would call just general program support
                    — providing foreign exchange so that goods could be imported, which doesn't
                    really promote development. In fact, it can be an impediment to development
                    under certain circumstances even though it will keep people fed and clothed in
                    the short run. There was a big balance of payments component to the program. The
                    technical programs were heavily in agriculture.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the AID people doing who were out in the rural

                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>NOOTER: Most AID people in the rural areas were CORDS people. They were involved
                    in rural development programs, for example. If there was a sorghum program they
                    would help see that the crop was introduced and that farmers understood how to
                    grow it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: The AID mission located mainly in Saigon supported the economic part of
                    the CORDS program in the field. Generally it worked reasonably well even though
                    the organizational arrangement was not very centralized. But the cooperation was
                    pretty good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your sense of the Vietnamese people that you
                        worked with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: As I said, the fact that they could produce a minor economic miracle in
                    the middle of the war convinced me that they had the potential to be another
                    economic tiger once that economy got straightened out if the war were ended. And
                    I guess the present Vietnamese government is beginning to loosen things up and
                    let some market response take place. If they carry that far enough, I have
                    little doubt we'll have another tiger in east Asia.</p>
                <p>Let me add one more thing. In this whole period we had a series of refugee
                    programs. It was a very major and active part of the program, feeding and
                    housing and dealing with the refugees that were generated by the war, and of
                    course that varied from time to time. Actually it would be better to talk about
                    this in the context of Cambodia and Laos, when I took over those programs,
                    because the refugee programs were even more important in Cambodia than in
                    Vietnam. But that was one activity of the AID mission that was important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the dealings with Congress on Vietnam, and the
                        public opinion about that at the time? Were you caught up in the general
                        hysteria about the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: First, on Congress let me take a minute to talk about that. I began
                    testifying before Congress in 1969 after John Bullitt had left, when I was
                    acting Assistant Administrator. Within the AID system, the Assistant
                    Administrators always went up to defend and try to justify their portions of the
                    program to various committees within the Congress. John Bullitt was a master at
                    testifying. He'd been a New York lawyer and was a good judge of human nature. He
                    was more successful in dealing with Otto Passman than anyone had ever been
                    before. I had the advantage of John's counsel and advice before I had my first
                    testimony before Otto Passman, who was in charge of the Subcommittee on Foreign
                    Assistance of the Appropriations Committee in the House.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>Otto was alleged to hate the foreign aid program, although perhaps he didn't hate
                    it quite as much as his reputation alleged, but he certainly used his
                    chairmanship position to humiliate all the witnesses who came before him. In
                    1962 when I had just joined AID, Ed Hutchinson had just been made Assistant
                    Administrator for Africa. Ed was a rather feisty, very dedicated, very serious
                    individual and very competent. But Ed refused to take Otto Passman's bullying
                    and would try to fight back. The result of that was that he was up there
                    testifying for 28 days for testimony that would normally take one day or two
                    days at the most, because Passman simply wouldn't let him get in the last
                    word.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, John's counsel to me was simply to not fight the problem. Just
                    accept the fact that Passman was going to dominate the situation, and the best
                    thing to do was simply to make it as brief and painless as possible, although
                    not letting him put something totally erroneous on the record, but short of
                    that, to simply get on with it, because much of what Passman dealt with was
                    minutiae and details that were part of what he wanted to build as a record but
                    wouldn't affect the overall appropriation level much.</p>
                <p>I followed that advice reasonably successfully. From those experiences I
                    developed the Passman five-to-one rule: that is, what I learned was that
                    whatever you said favorable about the program, Passman would put five times that
                    much on the record that was unfavorable. If you talked for a minute he would
                    talk for five or maybe ten. If you talked for an hour he would talk for five
                    hours. So you might as well save your breath. The ratio would always remain the
                    same. And that's what Ed Hutchinson had trouble accepting.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, my first testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee
                    was a high point. That committee was quite a serious and sensible committee, and
                    was trying to learn something as well as paint records. It had quite a diverse
                    membership from all the spectrums of the political scene, and they were prepared
                    to enter into a serious dialogue with a witness and have some sensible dialogue
                    that would reflect facts and opinions and had some value. I had an
                    extraordinarily good session with them during my first major appearance before a
                    Committee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember who the Chairman was at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Clem Zablocki , who was a fine man. He was kind of a Chicago ward healer,
                    but in the Harry Truman sense of rising above his background when he got into a
                    responsible position. And Zablocki had a serious interest in the AID program,
                    which didn't mean he was in favor of everything but he wanted to do it in a
                    responsible way. He ran a good committee with a good staff and good membership.
                    That got my Congressional testimony off to a good start, and while Congressional
                    testimony was always difficult, I enjoyed it with the exception of Otto Passman
                    or Clarence Long who succeeded him and who was just about as bad.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in any public debates on
                        Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Yes, one of the difficulties, of course, of being in charge of the
                    Vietnam program was that popular discontent was growing by leaps and bounds.
                    There were frequent demonstrations in Washington against the war. I had five
                    children at that time, most of them teenagers, who were all actively against the
                    war, as were most of my friends. So it was an extremely difficult period on a
                    personal level. My family was all very good about it in many ways, I guess,
                    because they knew I was against the war, too, even though my job caused me to do
                    certain things in connection with it, which I hope I did in a responsible way,
                    but that didn't mean that I favored our being there. What I favored was our
                    withdrawal, and I guess that fact made it a little easier within the family. I
                    don't think my children ever resented my role in it, nor did my wife, who was
                    equally as much against the war as my children.</p>
                <p>I do remember some good friends coming from St. Louis for an anti-war
                    demonstration once and asking if they could stay at our house. In fact, there
                    was a big crowd of them and we let them sleep in their sleeping bags in our
                    basement. I remember saying they were perfectly welcome to do that, and some of
                    my family went to the demonstration, but the only thing they couldn't do was put
                    a Viet Cong flag in the front yard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the public in general and the press? Did you
                        have a lot to do with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I didn't have many dealings with the press but I did have one or two
                    press conferences at the request of State. I remember one of these. I was naive
                    in dealing with the press. The economic situation at the time, probably in 1971
                    or 1972, was coming along pretty well and State thought it would be useful to
                    give a briefing on the economic situation. So there was a press conference
                    arranged in which I made a statement and then answered questions. The whole
                    thing went on for 45 minutes or an hour. I remember after it was over when I
                    came out everybody was very pleased with the way it had gone and what I had said
                    and the impression it had made. I said, on the other hand, that I was horrified
                    because out of that 45 minutes or an hour I realized that the reporters would
                    pick one or two sentences and that would be their story, and I didn't know which
                    ones they would pick.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>And it turned out that the only thing that made any significant story was a
                    reporter from one of the wire services who had asked about the level of aid that
                    would be needed over the next ten years. I think at that time it was $750
                    million a year, and he interpreted something I had said to mean that it would be
                    necessary to maintain that level for ten years, which I hadn't said but that was
                    his impression of what I'd said. Therefore, he quoted me as saying that seven
                    and a half billion dollars more in economic aid was needed for Vietnam. When I
                    saw the wire service story and called him to try to get him to correct it, he
                    refused because that would mean he would have to admit he had made an error. And
                    so that was the story that was generated out of this wonderful press conference.
                    Generally I took a low profile with the press, which was fine with me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I did not actually; I was spared that. I didn't have a role in trying to
                    make a public case for the program.</p>

                <p>NOOTER: At a personal level I remember helping to arrange a meeting one time with
                    some anti-war people. One of them had been a shipmate in World War II of Bill
                    Sullivan who was the senior person in the State Department running the Vietnam
                    program, to talk about it, but I didn't make any public appearances in that
                    respect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any direct dealings with the White House at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Henry Kissinger was the NSC chairman, and the economic and military
                    programs were really run out of the White House. Within the State Department,
                    Kissinger's link to the State Department was Bill Sullivan who was a Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary. They didn't go through the Secretary; they didn't even go
                    through Marshall Green who was the Assistant Secretary. It was a direct link to
                    Bill Sullivan. There was a committee that met several times a week of which I
                    was a member which Bill Sullivan chaired, and there were several people from
                    Kissinger's staff who came over along with people from the military and the CIA
                    as well as myself from AID. This was the nucleus of the planning and the policy
                    implementation within the government for the Vietnam program.</p>

                <p>NOOTER: That came, of course, out of the political campaign. It was Nixon 's
                    policy even before and certainly after his Asian mission with Marshall Green,
                    the whole policy of withdrawal and more restrained U.S. commitments abroad.</p>

                <p>NOOTER: Exactly — it was to give them a chance to make it on their own by helping
                    to arm them and equip them and helping strengthen their economy. Then we would

                        real possibility?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I believe that only became a realization as things got farther along,
                    especially after the attempt of the South Vietnamese army failed to carry out a
                    successful military operation on its own. In a way I was surprised the North
                    Vietnamese held back as long as they did after that particular engagement, which
                    was about 1972. They didn't really mount much of a serious attack until about
                    '74. I guess they decided it would be less costly in lives to wait till the U.S.
                    pulled out and they'd be able to take it as a pushover, which of course is what
                    happened.</p>
                <p>The thing for me personally that was uncomfortable was that while I was
                    comfortable with the policy of withdrawal, the rate of withdrawal was so slow.
                    It was slower than I anticipated when I took the position. I came to believe,
                    though I never had any proof on this from anybody, that the withdrawal pattern
                    was set to be sure there was not a collapse before the 1972 election. There were
                    enough U.S. ground troops there until 1972 that it would not fall before that
                    time. I am fully convinced of that although, as I say, you have to accept that
                    only as my opinion. I can't quote statistics or even direct quotes from anybody
                    to say that that was the basis of the policy. But certainly if you saw what was
                    going on and the rate at which withdrawal took place...</p>

                        to accomplish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: There was no question that on the economic side the Vietnamese could
                    handle it at any time. They had gone through their changes in macroeconomic
                    policies in 1971, and they were able to handle it after that.</p>
                <p>There was one ironical event when I was away on a trip somewhere — a mission to
                    Vietnam or a vacation somewhere in about 1972. I came back and everybody was in
                    a tizzy because the Defense Department had sent a letter to the Secretary of
                    State saying that while the military program seemed to be progressing well, they
                    were seriously concerned about the state of the economy, and couldn't State do
                    something to fix that. In fact it was totally untrue, but it caused an enormous
                    flap. It was generated by some economist the Defense Department had hired to
                    look at Vietnam and work on it, and who had somehow put Secretary of Defense
                    Laird, who had been a congressman from Wisconsin, up to writing this letter to
                    the Secretary of State.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any meeting with Kissinger or any dealings
                        with...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: That's interesting. I was going to mention that while I met regularly
                    with this working group, I never did meet Kissinger until about 1972 when
                    President Thieu came for a visit to the United States. The agreement was that he
                    would meet Nixon at San Clemente, and so all of us involved in the Vietnam
                    program went out to San Clemente, Nixon's residence in California, and met with
                    the Vietnamese there. And there I met Kissinger for the first time. I came back
                    and told my wife that it was an irony that I'd been working in the program for
                    two years and had never met Kissinger, and finally met him in the men's room.
                    The meeting at San Clemente was interesting in that I remember Kissinger telling
                    us ahead of time that by all means don't bring up any economic subjects because
                    Nixon hated economic discussions, and the fact of the matter was that all the
                    Vietnamese wanted to talk about was the economy.</p>
                <p>The other thing I recall was Nixon talking with us ahead of time, making the
                    rather cynical statement that the substance of the meeting was absolutely of no
                    importance whatsoever, the only thing that was of importance was that Thieu and
                    Nixon be seen as meeting by the press and by the public. And that was his
                    perhaps absolutely correct but cynical view of that meeting.</p>
                <p>I haven't given a real flavor of the tenor of those times. It was during that
                    period when the Pentagon papers were leaked, when demonstrations were frequent
                    and volatile and Washington was swamped with demonstrators.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I get the impression that you were a little bit isolated
                        or insulated from this somehow...that you weren't directly attacked or
                        confronted on this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: It was certainly all around us - demonstrators out in front of the State
                    Department and so on. When I first joined AID, the State Department was
                    completely open, there were no guards, anyone could come in off the street and
                    walk the corridors of the State Department. It was only when there were some
                    bomb explosions, maybe a bomb blew something up on the first floor, that they
                    began putting in guards. After that it was quite a different Government, and it
                    was in fact quite a bit more enjoyable previously. I remember somebody saying
                    how surprised John Bullitt was when he heard I accepted the Vietnam job, I guess
                    because I'd been vocal in my opinion that we should pull out of Vietnam well
                    before 1970. But as I say, I felt I could support the withdrawal policy, but I
                    would have done the withdrawal in two years rather instead of four years or five
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the attitude of people within AID toward the
                        Vietnam bureau and that operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: There was enormous pressure for AID people to go to Vietnam at the time
                    when there was a huge staff there. Many of them didn't want any part of the war,
                    and had joined the Agency because they were interested in economic development.
                    They didn't see Vietnam and certainly not CORDS as economic development but as
                    war support. When I was in Liberia, for example, people would be called to go to
                    Vietnam and they would deeply resent it and try to find ways not to go. AID
                    actually had to have a policy of forcing people to go at the threat of dismissal
                    because the requirement for staff was so huge compared to the amount of people
                    who would be willing to go without being forced.</p>
                <p>Now the ones with whom I worked, once they were assigned to it, to my knowledge
                    all did their jobs as earnestly and as conscientiously as they could. There was
                    no holding back or anything like sabotage or anything even approaching it, nor
                    do I remember people complaining about it once they had the assignment. Once
                    they were there and working, they did their job.</p>
                <p>But there was a lot of tension and a lot of feeling in the Agency about
                    Supporting Assistance, that this was really more political than economic. I'll
                    talk about that later when I get into other Supporting Assistance programs. My
                    own view, not so much on the Vietnam program but in general, was that if we
                    could get Supporting Assistance, it could be used for economic development. It
                    didn't make any difference to me whether it was called Development Assistance or
                    Supporting Assistance, we should use it as best we could to achieve economic
                    development. And if it was easier or better to get it by calling it a different
                    name, that was all right with me. At the same time I did feel an obligation that
                    it be used in a serious way and not, for example, for buying fake opium.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What, maybe this will come later, did the Vietnam
                        situation have an impact on AID, or its perception of what AID is about in
                        terms of congressional views or support? At that point we had, what 18,000
                        people on the rolls, and Vietnam was a factor that took a large staffing,
                        and then it started going down as we phased out, but what was the image of
                        AID or was it affected, did you have any sense, by the Vietnam domination of
                        the AID operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: My view is that the development part of the program went forward pretty
                    much the same, although later, for somewhat other reasons that don't necessarily
                    just relate to Vietnam, certain political programs got protected at the expense
                    of the development program. But I don't think that was so true in the Vietnam
                    years.</p>

                <p>NOOTER: I guess you're reminding me of a view that became popular. I didn't think

                        because development assistance, I think, was being used in Vietnam for
                        purposes that were not development. I've forgotten the issue now but...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: My view at that time, and I remember saying this in staff meeting, was
                    that 80% of the support for the foreign aid program was for cold war reasons and
                    20% was for humanitarian reasons. And if you had to rely on the humanitarian
                    alone, if you want to use that term for the purest kind of development
                    assistance, you would get about 20% of the funds you would get if there was a
                    communist threat in the world. I remember believing that at that time and I am
                    inclined to think that it was true.</p>
                <p>But now what has been interesting to me, as things have developed now with the
                    breakup of the Soviet Union and so on, is that in a sense aid has become more
                    ensconced in our thinking than it was in 1970 because I think in spite of the
                    fact that the aid budgets are being cut, there is a recognition that there is a
                    U.S. role providing foreign assistance even in spite of the absence of a
                    communist threat. And this support is somewhat larger than I would have
                    anticipated 25 years ago. We haven't seen this fully played out yet. We don't
                    know what it will look like in 5 years or 10 years.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>What I'm saying is that the support even for the development assistance part of
                    the program was based on political reasons to a fairly large extent anyway. It
                    was just that Supporting Assistance was more directly related to a situation
                    that was politically important than the average situation in the developing
                    world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we'll come back to that later. I think the specific
                        point, and I can't remember precisely...did you ever meet with Senator
                        Fulbright?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Oh yes, many times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the view that economic assistance particularly was
                        getting us in situations where we had then to get more and more involved,
                        and that therefore certain legislative restrictions or processes were
                        starting to be built in, limiting where we could provide this Supporting
                        Assistance, and you couldn't have it in the same country where there was
                        development assistance and so on. Because there was something at the time
                        trying to use Supporting Assistance in a way that he thought was contrary to
                        what Congress' intent — I can't remember the issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Yes, I do remember that but I don't think that was very broadly accepted
                    except by Fulbright himself. What did happen was that before Vietnam, aid was
                    something that liberals would support and conservatives would be against. And
                    out of Vietnam did come liberal antagonism in some quarters to foreign
                    involvement of almost any kind, including development assistance. For example,
                    you had Fulbright, who had been a person inclined to support foreign aid, who
                    turned against it, and then he became an ally of the conservatives who were
                    willing to cut aid for traditionally conservative reasons. But I don't think the
                    Fulbright view that aid would tend to get the U.S. involved in foreign
                    entanglements was one that was broadly accepted. Certainly it was not by other
                    aid supporters such as Hubert Humphrey or even people like Senators Stennis,
                    Percy, Javits or Aiken.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: In 1974 the Agency reorganized again. The AID management found Supporting
                    Assistance was spreading to different regions in the world, and it was thought
                    of as not very efficient to have this all managed from a single Bureau. I must
                    say that I got a lot of sympathy in the years that I was managing the programs
                    in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and Israel. It was kind of a
                    running joke that one person would be burdened with all of these hot spots. But
                    in fact it was all quite fascinating.</p>

                <p>AID reorganization and a new assignment as Assistant Administrator for the Middle
                    East, Southeast Asia and North Africa</p>
                <p>At any rate in 1974 the Agency reorganized and went back to a geographic basis. I
                    took the Middle East Bureau, which at that time extended all the way from
                    Bangladesh to Morocco. South Asia was included in the Middle East group at that
                    time. There was also an East Asia Bureau that ran from Burma on through Korea.
                    So I continued to run the Supporting Assistance programs in the Middle East
                    countries, but Southeast Asia was managed by the East Asia Bureau after
                    1974.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: That's right. I told my successor that Vietnam was going all right when I
                    left it, I don't know what he did wrong, but the collapse came after it was no
                    longer my responsibility.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, at some time in about 1973 when Colby was offered the job as
                    Director of CIA, Ambassador Bunker asked if I would come out to Vietnam and
                    become head of the CORDS program, but I declined. And so I missed those last
                    hectic months, fortunately.</p>
                <p>So I continued with the Middle East Supporting Assistance programs, but I also
                    picked up the development programs in Southeast Asia and North Africa, and then
                    a few new Supporting Assistance programs which developed in that area. But I
                    only had South Asia for a short time before it became part of the Asia Bureau
                    after the East Asia Bureau was reorganized. But I did handle the South Asia
                    countries for about a year and a half. At that time our program in India was not
                    very large. I did visit Pakistan and see the program there.</p>
                <p>I guess the most heavy personal involvement I had in that area was in Afghanistan
                    where one of the interesting AID experiences for me was reviewing AID's support
                    for the Hellman Valley . The Hellman Valley is an area in southern Afghanistan
                    that has been a historic area of irrigation that goes back to the tenth century.
                    It's a natural area for irrigation. By South Asia standards it's not very large.
                    I do not recall the exact size, but it may be 25,000 or 50,000 acres. It's small
                    compared to the Pakistan and India irrigated areas but for Afghanistan, it's
                    extremely important.</p>
                <p>In the earlier period of irrigation in the tenth and eleventh century it
                    deteriorated because of invasion and the breakdown of the government in
                    Afghanistan. Starting in the 193's, the Afghan Government tried to develop it.
                    It employed a private U.S. company to develop the Hellman Valley that goes back
                    to that period. The AID program began supporting it sometime in the 50s, and by
                    1973, AID had finally decided after more than 20 years that support for the
                    Hellman Valley should cease.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>In 1974 Henry Kissinger made a visit there, and the Government told him their
                    distress about learning that aid was stopping. They asked if the U.S. government
                    would reconsider. Henry said he would send out some experts to review the
                    decision. He didn't promise anything but he said we would take a look at it. I
                    was the “expert” that was sent to review it. While I had been involved in
                    irrigation; I'm not an irrigation expert, but I did do a good bit of homework on
                    the Hellman Valley, the potential and what the problems were. I visited the
                    Valley and saw the situation firsthand. It was quite an interesting
                    situation.</p>
                <p>First of all, about half of the Valley had already been fully developed and was
                    functioning, and it was one of the most productive areas in Afghanistan. And the
                    other portion of the valley, where we'd been giving assistance most recently, I
                    discovered had never had a proper drainage system installed. My conclusion, on a
                    purely technical basis, was that the area, which was suffering from salting,
                    could at a relatively low cost be improved with the completion of the drainage
                    that should have been put in in the first place. And so to the horror of my
                    staff and my deputy, Al White, who had worked for years to try to get us to
                    phase out of Hellman, I made the commitment, with, of course, the agreement of
                    senior management, to continue a program there. I still think that this was a
                    sound decision.</p>
                <p>I left the area before the work was completed, so it's hard to say the outcome,
                    but it would be another good subject to go back and review. I suppose with the
                    war and the various military activities going on in that area in recent years, I
                    have no idea what the condition of the Valley is now, however. The Hellman
                    Valley is an example of aid that did lead to development of a very productive
                    area, much more gradual and not as dramatic as the East Bank of the Jordan
                    Valley, but at the time I was there, after 20 or 25 years, the Valley was just
                    coming into its real productive potential, and was a very important part of the
                    agricultural production capacity of the country.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were in Afghanistan generally I guess on the borders
                        with the Soviet Union, and therefore you were truly on the front lines of
                        the Cold War I suppose. Did you see any evidence of that kind of proximity
                        to Soviet efforts or influence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Everyone was very much aware of the Soviet presence. We didn't run the
                    Afghan program as a Supporting Assistance program, however; it was a pure
                    economic development program. However, we were aware at that time that the
                    Soviets were concerned that Afghanistan could be an influence on their Islamic
                    republics. Some of the later Soviet involvement in Afghanistan was to keep
                    Afghanistan from influencing the Soviet Islamic republics to break away and
                    become independent, which of course ultimately they have done. The Afghans were
                    receiving Soviet aid as well as U.S. aid. My chief Afghan counterpart down in
                    the Hellman Valley had been trained in Moscow. However, I found him quite
                    compatible and we got along very well, but a lot of their people were Soviet
                    trained. So there was an attempt on the part of the Soviets to maintain good
                    relations with Afghanistan at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>One other incident from that period. Dan Parker superseded John Hannah, and there
                    was some delay in his clearance because he had been involved in fund-raising in
                    the Nixon campaign of 1972. But at any rate Dan, as was Hannah, was seriously
                    interested in the foreign aid program. I didn't agree with all of his ideas - he
                    tended to think that modern science and modern technology could be used more
                    extensively and extended more rapidly into development programs than my
                    experience would indicate would be the case, but nevertheless he was a serious
                    supporter of the development program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...in computers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Yes, computers, satellites, satellite education systems and so on. I
                    recall going on several trips with Dan, and one was to Pakistan, where we called
                    on Ali Bhutto in about 1974. I recall Ali Bhutto asking us quite seriously
                    whether it wasn't the case that the U.S. was in decline as a major world power.
                    We, of course, without trying to appear too defensive, assured him that we
                    intended to be around for a few centuries more. And of course we lasted a good
                    bit longer than he did. But it did highlight the fact that this was a common
                    view of the U.S. in '74 and '75 due to the apparent defeat in Vietnam, and the
                    fact that we were having enormous economic problems and high rates of inflation
                    and so on. In those years the U.S. image abroad was not very high.</p>
                <p>In 1975 we had a program in Lebanon to try to restore the damage that was done
                    from the fighting that had taken place, which came from the presence of the
                    Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, an Israeli incursion into the southern part of
                    the country, and fighting between the Palestinians and the Syrians around
                    Beirut. The World Bank was also involved in that; I recall we worked with them
                    very closely. I believe that we did this with Supporting Assistance. That was my
                    first venture into Lebanon , and one of the interesting things there was that it
                    had the most minimal government I had ever seen in my life. The government
                    structure was extremely small and the sorts of things like running the ports and
                    so on that in other countries were usually done by governments were done under
                    contract to private individuals. It was quite a minimalist government, and it
                    worked very well until the political formula broke down. We came in to help
                    rebuild their port, some housing, probably some telecommunications and so on,
                    with the World Bank. The fighting broke out again in 1976 and I think we came
                    back again after that. I don't know how many times we went in and helped, but
                    each time they managed to tear it down again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were supporting American University of Beirut at that
                        time too I guess?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>NOOTER: We were giving support to the American University of Beirut under a
                    special line item program called American Schools and Hospitals Abroad, or
                    something like that. It goes back many, many years. I don't think we did
                    anything special for them because of the war, but we did continue the support,
                    which was mainly used to fund scholarships to the University for students from
                    other Arab countries. I recall going out there and calling on them. They had a
                    hospital as part of the University medical teaching program, and at that time
                    the hospital had survived very well because it was treating injured persons from
                    all sides of the conflict without reference to who were friends and who were
                    enemies, and the result was that everybody left them alone.</p>
                <p>I remember on a later trip that they had had one round fall in a yard in the
                    University just before I got there, which was the first time they were impinged
                    on. Later, I believe, the President of the University and other staff were
                    kidnapped and held hostage. But that was much later and I don't know the
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>We also had a program to help the resettlement of Portuguese returning from
                    Angola and Mozambique; in 1975, when the Portuguese agreed to pull out about
                    600,000 Portuguese citizens who were living in those countries when they were
                    Portuguese colonies. In a country of 9 million people, this made an enormous
                    inflow of people without homes and without jobs and so on. We agreed to provide
                    them assistance, which included housing, apartment dwellings, school buildings,
                    other kinds of direct refugee aid such as food aid and that sort of thing. And
                    so for a number of years we helped Portugal. The amazing thing was how quickly
                    those refugees were assimilated into the economy, and I believe within about
                    three years they were hardly visible anymore. Somehow they adapted, even those
                    who were of mixed race. A lot of the Portuguese had intermarried and there were
                    a lot of mixed race people among the refugees. But nevertheless they were
                    absorbed relatively quickly into society, and I guess our programs were of some
                    help in doing that. But of course, as in all aid programs, the main cause of the
                    success came from the degree of the resourcefulness of the recipients.</p>
                <p>We also had a program in Cyprus. The Turkish army invaded Cyprus in support of
                    the Turkish minority there in about 1974. The Turkish population was about 20%
                    of the total population of Cyprus. They were the low-income part of the society,
                    working as servants and so on. They lived interspersed with the Greek Cypriots.
                    With the Turkish army's invasion, the Turkish population moved up to the north
                    and the Turkish army secured the northern half of the island for them. Now the
                    geography of Cyprus is such that the best, most fertile land, and the most
                    scenic area and the tourist centers were mainly in the north. And the Greek
                    population had to withdraw into the southern half of the island. Once again
                    there was a refugee situation to be dealt with — the need for housing, the need
                    for jobs and so on. We undertook to help, and I made several trips out to
                    Cyprus.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>Again, the startling thing in the case of Cyprus, even more than in Portugal, was
                    how quickly the Greek population recovered from that event. They had lost the
                    citrus orchards in the north, which were a main source of livelihood. They had
                    lost the tourist centers, the main port was in the north, most of the fertile
                    land was in the north, as I have said. But in spite of that, within 2 or 3
                    years, per capita income of the Greek population had been restored to the same
                    level that it was before the invasion. They got some windfall from what was
                    going on in the Middle East at that time, when some money coming out of Lebanon
                    went to Cyprus, and it became kind of a financial center in lieu of Beirut,
                    which was a fortuitous event for Cyprus. But other than that, it was simply that
                    there was a very productive and ingenious population who were able to apply
                    themselves to restore their economy. As I remember the numbers, the per capita
                    income of the Greek population was calculated to be around $1300 per capita
                    before the invasion, and the Turkish population was about $400. After the
                    separation and after the restoration of order, say three years after 1974, about
                    the same numbers applied. The Turks in the north, in spite of having all of the
                    assets, were still around $400. Our aid was all to the south, of course, since
                    we did not agree with the Turkish use of force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were only helping the south?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: We were only helping the south, yes. Turkey in this case was thought of
                    as an invading force, and while we had close relations with Turkey in other
                    respects, we didn't in terms of Cyprus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what was our program? Mainly...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: It was to help the refugees in their short term needs. Housing was a
                    major part of it. They reestablished the tourist industry using their southern
                    facilities, and as I say, it became kind of a financial center. I had problems
                    with the Kennedy Subcommittee on Cyprus, because after the first three years
                    when it became apparent that things were going extremely well and the economy
                    was recovering and the growth rate was quite good, the Administration thought
                    that the aid level could be reduced, and in fact shortly would no longer be
                    needed. But the Kennedy Subcommittee disagreed with that and I think were
                    successful in enacting assistance for Cyprus that extended beyond what the
                    Administration had requested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any sense of what the political pressures
                        were that led to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>NOOTER: It would probably be unfair to say, but I guess there was a constituency
                    in Massachusetts that might have had some bearing. I mean a Greek Cypriot, or a
                    Greek, constituency that might have had some influence on the situation. We had
                    some rather heated exchanges on the issue of whether further assistance was
                    necessary, since it was my job to defend the Administration's position before
                    the Subcommittee.</p>
                <p>We also undertook a curious program in Malta, which had never been a U.S. aid
                    recipient. At that time Prime Minister Mintoff, who was the leader of a Labour
                    Government, had announced that he was not going to renew an agreement to allow
                    the British fleet to use Malta as a base. This was a longstanding agreement that
                    had gone back for many years. There is a close link between Malta and Great
                    Britain. A lot of British people go there to retire. They call their parties the
                    Labour party and the Conservatives. They had a British Governor General there
                    for many years, and I don't know whether they still do.</p>
                <p>In any event, Mintoff announced the termination of the British base agreement,
                    and both the British and the U.S. thought that was a bad idea because of Cold
                    War interests in the Mediterranean. And after tortuous negotiations, there was
                    an agreement that Mintoff would extend that agreement for seven years based on a
                    certain level of payments by the British, but supplemented by some assistance
                    from the United States. The British felt that whatever their payment was was all
                    they could afford, and the rest would have to come from us. This was a little
                    like the Uruguay agreement where the U.S. economic portion of that agreement was
                    a bit fuzzy.</p>
                <p>I was sent out to Malta develop a program with the Malta government that would
                    represent the fulfillment of the U.S. commitment. And so three or four of us
                    went out as a team, and I was the team leader. We stayed in the Governor
                    General's quarters, where they had the longest bathtub I've ever seen in my
                    life, and we visited all of the various Government Departments and talked about
                    what their needs were and so on. We in AID interpreted the agreement to mean
                    that the actual Supporting Assistance level should only be $5 million, since
                    funding was very restricted at that time and we thought that that would be an
                    adequate level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One time or many...?</hi>
                </p>

                <p>NOOTER: It was thought of as a one time figure in the case of Malta. We also
                    agreed to provide some PL 480 wheat, but what we also worked out was that the
                    Maltese could buy surplus Army equipment from the European U.S. military bases.
                    There was a program, I don't know how widely understood or advertised, where aid
                    recipients were allowed to buy surplus equipment from U.S. military stocks for a
                    fraction of its cost. Often this was 10% or 20% of its initial costs, and
                    sometimes this was new equipment: trucks, cranes, heavy automotive equipment of
                    various kinds. Of all the things that we offered the Maltese, this was what they
                    were most excited about because they had big shipyards and needed cranes and
                    equipment of the kind that was available in this stock. And so what really
                    satisfied their interest was the surplus equipment.</p>
                <p>Mintoff was known to be an extremely difficult, acerbic, brilliant fellow. We had
                    two meetings with him in which I participated, and I saw several sides of him.
                    He came by the first night when we arrived around midnight - he kept strange
                    hours - and talked to the team a little about what their needs were. It was a
                    very cordial meeting, and he was very charming - he was putting on his most
                    accommodating face. At the end of the week we were there, the U.S. Ambassador
                    had arranged that we would go see him to summarize the findings of our team, and
                    so the Ambassador and I went to see him, again in the evening, I think it was
                    around 10 p.m., in which he listened in a perfunctory way to the economic
                    arrangements which he found no fault with. Then he proceeded to take apart our
                    Ambassador on various political issues, and did this in a most insulting
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not necessarily related to Malta?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Oh, it was related to U.S. - Malta relations absolutely, but not to the
                    economic program. In fact, we had given our report earlier to a lower level team
                    and so that was sort of settled. So he used this occasion to bring up uncertain
                    political interests. He was very close to Qadhafi, among others, and thought he
                    was kind of a link between Italy and North Africa and particularly with Libya.
                    Of course, Malta sits between the two and has a population which has an Italian
                    upper class and an Arab underclass. It was quite a fascinating meeting. However,
                    we succeeded in fulfilling our mission at quite minimal cost to the U.S.
                    government, and the base agreement stayed in effect for seven years.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>One other thing I might mention is on Pakistan and India. At that time, our main
                    interest in those countries was in regard to wheat production, where the large
                    irrigated areas in Pakistan and India were thought to not be producing the
                    amount of output that they should, considering the availability of water and the
                    infrastructure that was in place. There were several reasons for this. Water
                    usage wasn't very efficient because they didn't charge for it. Another was that
                    historically grain prices were set by the government and kept at prices that
                    were too low to create incentives to produce. We did some calculations that
                    showed that in Pakistan if they achieved agricultural output at the same rate of
                    productivity per acre as we did in irrigated areas in the United States and a
                    few other places around the world, they could increase their output by eight
                    times. At that time there was enormous apprehension around the world about a
                    world food shortage. It's a distant memory now, but you may remember that there
                    was enormous concern about the world's running out of resources and being unable
                    to feed itself. The oil crisis had come in 1973. Saudi Arabia was trying to
                    assist Sudan to become a “bread basket” in order to be able to feed itself. I
                    remember attending a conference in Aspen on this subject. But based on what we
                    knew about things like Pakistan and their level of output from the available
                    resources that they had, it was quite obvious that this was not at all a matter
                    of not being able to produce enough. We concluded that it was mainly a function
                    of price. If the price were high enough, the food would be produced, and in the
                    case of Pakistan and India they had been suppressing the price and having to
                    import food because they hadn't let farmers have an incentive to produce.</p>
                <p>At the time I looked at the problem in 1975, India had begun to change its policy
                    and had set wheat prices that were about 30% higher than the comparable prices
                    in Pakistan. I didn't watch India closely in subsequent years, but India began
                    to get an increased response, and from a subcontinent that people thought could
                    not feed itself, suddenly India began producing a surplus. I believe that it has
                    not had a serious problem feeding its own population since that time, even
                    though the population must be many, many millions of people greater than it was
                    then.</p>
                <p>Pakistan had not yet made that change, and did not during the time that I was
                    involved in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in 197...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: 1975, yes. '74 or '75 I visited those two countries a couple of
                    times.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>There was a similar experience in the Philippines. I remember when I first
                    testified on the Philippines in around 1969, that the IRA-8 rice varieties had
                    just come out and the Philippines had just become self-sufficient in rice. I
                    remember testifying that now the Philippines, because of IRA-8, had become
                    self-sufficient in rice. I made a visit to the Philippines shortly thereafter,
                    and in the course of that visit I found that the Philippines had been
                    self-sufficient in rice periodically over the past 15 or 20 years. Each time
                    that they became self-sufficient, it would drive the price down the next year,
                    and they would no longer be self-sufficient. At the time I made my visit, which
                    was the year after they had become self-sufficient, I found depressed prices and
                    reduced production. That was the first of many lessons about the power of prices
                    in influencing output and production. And how important the pricing, marketing
                    and of course exchange rate policy is, since the exchange rate influences the
                    relationships between imported and domestic production. The technology is
                    important but it doesn't stand alone. It stands in the context of all these
                    other factors, which can be overwhelming to what is happening to the
                    technology.</p>
                <p>Running the Middle East Bureau was perhaps my most satisfying AID assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to those two or three years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I was running parts of the Middle East from 1972, that is the Supporting
                    Assistance programs in the Middle East, which included the major ones. But then
                    in 1974 with the reorganization, I dropped Southeast Asia and picked up the
                    development programs in the other Middle Eastern, and for awhile South Asian
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that the most satisfying job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: The programs were interesting. It was less war-related than Southeast
                    Asia. There was interesting development going on. Of course, that had been true
                    in East Asia also, but in East Asia I was the Deputy and it's always more fun to
                    be the head. We had a good staff, very conscientious and serious people trying
                    to do a good job in a professional way, and a program with a lot of variety in
                    it. It included anything from the politically oriented programs in Egypt, Jordan
                    and Syria to the more purely developmental problems and programs in the other
                    countries in the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular things that you were trying to
                        get done at that time, policies or efforts to reform or change?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>NOOTER: The program with the biggest impact on the country, of course, was the
                    Egypt program because it was so large. I can't remember how large it was at the
                    end of that period. I mentioned that it started at $250 million a year, but then
                    it went on and expanded beyond that. Of course because of its political
                    orientation, we didn't have much leverage to transform the economy, but
                    nevertheless that was one of our objectives. I would say in terms of that
                    objective we didn't really succeed. We made some marginal changes but we didn't
                    succeed in an overall way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why didn't you succeed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Because of the political orientation of the program. It wasn't possible
                    to threaten stopping the program. It was politically difficult for the Egyptians
                    to make the kind of changes that would have been desirable, such as raising the
                    price of bread and adjusting the exchange rate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A point we'd like to come back to later, okay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I will make a comment on the Aswan Dam because that's received so much
                    comment in the press over the years. We weren't directly involved in the Aswan
                    Dam at the time that it was built. Both the U.S. and the World Bank pulled back
                    for whatever reasons - I wasn't involved in it at the time - for either
                    political or economic reasons, and it was built with Russian assistance. It is
                    one of the largest hydroelectric dams and irrigation projects in the world. It
                    is on the Nile River, and affects the entire flow of the Nile and therefore the
                    water supply of the whole Nile Valley, which is what Egypt really lives on.</p>
                <p>It has come in for a lot of criticism for having caused adverse environmental
                    effects, and for upsetting the natural flow of the river. I visited the dam and
                    also had a chance to study the impact of it, and I can only say that while it
                    did cause some health problems because of schistosomiasis, which is a
                    debilitating disease, not deadly but debilitating, on the downstream side of the
                    dam in the irrigated areas, nevertheless it would be almost inconceivable how
                    Egypt would have been able to grow any reasonable portion of its food supply if
                    it hadn't built the dam. Before that they were limited to a single crop a year
                    after the floods - as the floods would recede, their crop would be planted and
                    they would grow a crop. With the dam they could grow crops twelve months a year.
                    That means two or a little more than two crops a year. Given the limited amount
                    of agricultural land and the limited amount of water it's almost inconceivable
                    that they could have got by without the dam.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>There were some technical drawbacks to the way they used the electricity from the
                    dam. They had put in an old nitrogen fertilizer plant built on the old German
                    design — taking nitrogen out of the air which takes a large amount of
                    electricity — and at the time we were there they were still using a lot of their
                    power from the dam for that purpose in a very uneconomic way, at the same time
                    that we were putting in additional electric power supply of the more
                    conventional kind to meet the growing demand for electricity. At the time the
                    dam was built there was a surplus of electricity, but as that changed the
                    Egyptians failed to close down these uneconomic plants. I don't know what
                    they've done in the meantime, but at the time that was a misuse of a portion of
                    the electricity from the dam.</p>
                <p>But the irrigation was a priority. With a hydroelectric dam that serves both
                    irrigation and power they have to make a choice between production of power or
                    an optimal flow of water for irrigation, and they always gave the priority to
                    irrigation. In that respect I think the dam was extremely useful for Egypt, and
                    I can't agree with those who claim that it shouldn't have been built.</p>
                <p>As I say, we weren't directly involved in the dam, but because of such things as
                    becoming involved in hydroelectric plants as alternative sources of supply, we
                    studied the problem and tried to understand its relationship to the rest of the
                    economy.</p>
                <p>The beginning of the Carter Administration and appointment as Deputy
                    Administrator - 1976</p>
                <p>At this point in 1976 Jimmy Carter was elected President, and the long string of
                    Republican administrations came to an end. I was in the position of having come
                    in under the Kennedy Administration, being recruited at a relatively senior
                    level, but not really a political appointee in the sense that I didn't have any
                    particular political antecedents. Nevertheless I had not come up from the bottom
                    of the civil service, and so I'd come in in a process that was used for
                    political appointments. But then before the Republicans had come in I'd served
                    there long enough in a professional capacity to have been integrated into the
                    regular AID foreign service. So when the Republicans came in I could be viewed
                    as a professional rather than as a political appointee, although of course I
                    mentioned some of the difficulties I had getting acceptance from the Nixon
                    Administration for my first political appointment.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Nevertheless, when the Democrats came back, I had been serving under Presidential
                    Appointment level positions in a Republican administration for six years, and
                    therefore there is always a question of one's ability to survive into the next
                    Administration. People at that level are all required to submit their
                    resignations at the time a new Administration comes in. In any event, John
                    Gilligan was appointed as the AID Administrator. John was a former Governor of
                    Ohio who had been defeated in his try for a second term, and he had been
                    selected to be AID Administrator. He brought with him five or six people from
                    the outside who were part of his “inner circle” who helped him during the
                    transition period. Some of these people had worked on Carter's campaign, and
                    some were from Democratic staff positions on Capitol Hill. These five or six
                    then proceeded to review the Agency personnel as well as people outside of the
                    Agency and attempt to make their personnel selections for the appointive
                    positions in AID.</p>
                <p>There were about fifteen positions at the level that required Congressional
                    approval. This included the Administrator, the Deputy Administrator and perhaps
                    11 or 12 Assistant Administrators. In addition to that, there were about 300
                    positions in the Agency that could be selected without reference to
                    Congressional confirmation or without reference to the civil or foreign service.
                    These people could be brought in at the will of the management of the Agency and
                    given temporary appointments. These positions ranged all the way from the top
                    level, that is GS-18 at the civil service side or FSR-1 at the foreign service
                    side, down to the secretarial level. These were positions, for example, if an
                    AID Administrator came in and he wanted to bring his secretary from a former
                    organization with him, he could bring her in to what were called AD positions. I
                    can't remember what the initials stood for but they were appointive
                    positions.</p>
                <p>This was the latitude that the new management had to bring in people from the
                    outside. The Gilligan team interviewed all of the senior people including myself
                    and on whatever basis made an offer to me to become the Deputy Administrator. I
                    guess the Administrator wanted to appoint some senior professionals from the old
                    system, since none of his inner circle had any experience in economic
                    development. On whatever basis, he must have decided my appointment under the
                    Republicans was not a political choice, but was a professional one, and
                    therefore offered me that job, which I accepted. He filled the other 11 or 12
                    Assistant Administrator positions with a mixture of professionals who were
                    already in the Agency and people he brought in from the outside. I can't
                    remember the proportion; I guess the bulk of them were from the outside but not
                    all of them.</p>
                <p>He didn't have any professional background in the aid business nor was he an
                    economist. He did bring in Jack Sullivan, the Assistant Administrator for East
                    Asia, from the House Foreign Relations Committee who had been a staff person
                    there and was familiar with the AID program. But Jack was not one of the five or
                    six that I referred to as his inner circle.</p>
                <p>Well, several things happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get cleared? Was there any issue about your
                        getting cleared?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Yes, that's what I'm coming to. My nomination went through the clearance
                    process in the White House, and that was not an issue. It went up to the Hill
                    and was submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where under the
                    regular procedure a nominee goes for a hearing with questions and so on, the
                    committee votes on you, and then it's sent to the Senate for confirmation. All
                    of that went forward without incident. It went forward to the Committee, and I
                    appeared before the Committee and had a hearing, and the committee voted my
                    confirmation without any negative votes. The nomination was then ready to go to
                    the Senate when Ted Kennedy put a hold on the nomination, which any Senator can
                    do.</p>
                <p>His objection to the nomination stemmed in part from some of the hearings
                    regarding refugees, that I mentioned. I didn't mention one of those hearings
                    that perhaps was the most interesting Congressional hearing of my career, when
                    in about 1971 Bill Colby, who was head of the CORDS program in Vietnam at that
                    time, was back in the United States and was asked to testify before the Kennedy
                    Subcommittee on the Vietnam refugee program, and CORDS' role in dealing with
                    refugees.</p>
                <p>I was asked to go along with Bill to accompany him as a supporting witness, and
                    although ultimately I never did have to answer any questions, this was at the
                    time when the anti-war feeling was at its peak. An organization called Vietnam
                    Veterans Against the War had been formed and was at that particular time camped
                    on the Mall to participate in demonstrations against the war. And they, of
                    course, heard about this hearing and packed the hearing room in the Russell
                    Office Building. So when Bill and I arrived the room was packed with veterans in
                    army surplus clothing; television cameras and floodlights were lighting the
                    room, and our going down the aisle to take our place near the head of the room
                    for questioning was a little like running an Indian gauntlet, with catcalls and
                    whistles and an enormous amount of emotion. This was true through the whole
                    hearing, where Colby's replies would be greeted with “Liar,” and the only thing
                    that saved the thing from breaking out in total pandemonium was that Kennedy,
                    although he had called this hearing as a kind of anti-war protest, nevertheless
                    was required to maintain some semblance of order in the hearing or he would have
                    come under criticism. And so he had the job of quieting the veterans to a
                    certain extent and keeping the hearing more or less in bounds. But it was an
                    emotion-charged hearing as you can imagine.</p>
                <p>This was the kind of background that I guess was behind Kennedy's objection to my
                    nomination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a particular issue that you were testifying
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>NOOTER: It was about the handling of refugees, because it was a Refugee
                    Subcommittee. The testimony had to do with the number of refugees, how they were
                    being handled and what was being done to help them, but the real issue was the
                    war and whether the U.S. should even be in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whatever your position was, you were somewhat symbolizing
                        the Administration's position...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: That's right, we represented the Administration and the U.S. presence in
                    Vietnam at a time when a lot of people thought we should have gone home. And in
                    fact I thought that too, but that was not my role in the hearing. For this and
                    other reasons such as our belief that the Cyprus program should be terminated at
                    the time when Kennedy wanted to continue it, and I guess the fact that in
                    Kennedy's mind I was a representative of the Republican Administrations, or
                    whatever, in spite of the fact that I'd come in under the Presidency of his
                    brother didn't seem to make any difference.</p>
                <p>I remember calling on him and having quite a civilized personal chat about my
                    nomination. Indeed, I knew him quite well because we didn't only have testimony
                    but would sometimes provide him with information or I would come to see him on
                    issues that he would want to discuss. So I knew him extremely well, and in fact,
                    odd as it seems, had at least a reasonably good working relationship with him in
                    day to day business. Sometimes in the hearings his staff assistant Dale de Hahn
                    was obnoxious, and we sometimes had sharp disagreements relating to what the
                    facts were in one situation or another. Anyway, for any or all of these reasons,
                    Kennedy decided to oppose my appointment, even though he was a Democratic
                    Senator and it was a Democratic President who had nominated me.</p>
                <p>The staff circulated a memo on the Hill about a week before my nomination was
                    scheduled to come up for a vote. The first step had been that he put a hold on
                    the nomination. It's the custom in the Senate that any Senator can hold up any
                    nomination for any period of time he wishes. This gives great leverage in
                    dealing with appointments. But eventually after several months' delay Kennedy
                    did agree to release it to the floor for a vote. And about a week before it was
                    to come to the floor, as I say, his staff circulated a memorandum about what was
                    supposed to be my record and what I had done. The memorandum was so scurrilous
                    and inaccurate that I recall consulting a friend who was a lawyer to see if it
                    was possible to sue. It really was libelous. My friend, who had worked up on the
                    Hill herself previously, advised me that Senators were immune from being sued
                    even though the staff had done it and there really was no chance to deal with
                    this in any legal way. It was particularly galling because if Kennedy had raised
                    these issues at the Senate confirmation hearing, I would have had an opportunity
                    to reply or answer the charges.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>However, the Administration was able to mobilize considerable support in my
                    behalf, and Gilligan and his Congressional Relations people did contact people
                    as I did. Of course, I had been testifying on the Hill some seven years by that
                    time, and I was well-known to many people up there. And so a number of the
                    Senators agreed to support me, including Senator Humphrey, who was a good
                    friend, not a close friend but someone I knew quite well, and Senator Inouye,
                    whom I had testified before many times and worked quite closely with on a number
                    of issues, as well as Senator Stennis, whom I didn't know so closely, but who
                    agreed to support me, and one or two others.</p>
                <p>And so it went to the Senate floor. My wife and a couple of my children went
                    along and listened to the debate. There's a record of that, of course, somewhere
                    in the Congressional records. It was unbelievable because the issues that were
                    discussed had so little relation to the actual facts. Kennedy had rounded up
                    some support from Senator Sarbanes and one other Senator, I forget who it was,
                    who spoke against me, more or less along the lines of the memorandum that had
                    been produced by Kennedy's staff. And Senators Humphrey, Inouye, Stennis and one
                    other Senator spoke in my favor. Senator Kennedy only secured the three votes
                    that he had rounded up, and the rest of the Senate voted to confirm me. But
                    nevertheless it was a very nasty and unpleasant incident.</p>
                <p>The irony was that that evening after the vote, I had to go to some meeting and
                    was out. The telephone rang at my home and my wife answered. It was Senator
                    Kennedy who had called. He asked if I was home, and my wife told him I was out.
                    He said he just wanted to call to congratulate me on my appointment. I guess
                    this was in the old Irish spirit of after the fight is over you shake hands and
                    make up and get on with your business, but my wife had trouble keeping a civil
                    tongue.</p>
                <p>At any rate, on that basis I was confirmed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He must have been making a larger point than a personal
                        one though, don't you think? Is that possible? He had a political issue he
                        was promoting through this thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Well, it's not clear to me what his political issue was. I hate to put on
                    the record some of the rumors as to why he did that. After all, he isn't here to
                    defend himself, but it's not as though he wanted to attack the Carter
                    Administration. He did like to carve out a position for himself as being the
                    main defender of the refugees. But to do that in opposition to his own party was
                    hardly the normal way of going about making a record. I think I know some of his
                    motives, but he may have sincerely thought I was a poor choice for the job. That
                    certainly is his privilege. The fact that he got so little support from other
                    people who knew my record must have said something about that. But in any event
                    the confirmation passed and I went on with my job. But it did not leave a
                    pleasant aftertaste.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>Meanwhile, while I was waiting for this to be completed, I was nevertheless
                    filling the job of Deputy Administrator, which is normal in that kind of
                    situation. And I found myself in the strange position of being the only career
                    person amid the five or six outsiders John had brought in. He was always very
                    good about including me in most if not all of the meetings of that group. But it
                    was a group with a bias that grew out of the Carter candidacy's view of the
                    Government as something that needed to be changed.</p>
                <p>It's hard to recall now, perhaps, but Carter came in as an outsider to Government
                    at a time a little bit like today, when people were saying that Government
                    should undergo a drastic change. Some of the people in John's inner circle felt
                    very strongly that this mandate should be carried out. One of them, perhaps the
                    most influential, who was named to the third highest position in AID, was Ted
                    Van Dyke. John was the Administrator, I was the Deputy, and Ted Van Dyke was
                    Assistant Administrator for Programs, which was the next position in the
                    hierarchy of the Agency. Van Dyke stated unequivocally, at least in this small
                    group, that he thought that at least one third of the people in the Agency
                    should be turned out, should be dismissed, within the first six months or else
                    the new management was not doing its job.</p>
                <p>He later was involved in a study of AID's organizational structure, although he
                    didn't have any economic or development background. Gilligan himself, at around
                    this time, said publicly that the people in AID were “overage, overpaid, and
                    over here,” meaning in Washington rather than overseas.</p>
                <p>Now you have to know John Gilligan to understand his ability to say that. He was
                    a person who shot from the hip, who had the ability to make a quip, a turn of
                    phrase that caught the attention. But sometimes he regretted, as he ultimately
                    did this remark, some of the things he said in that way. Nevertheless, this was
                    a statement he had made. And so it wasn't surprising that the AID professionals,
                    most of whom were serious people trying to do a good job in something that
                    they'd made their life's career, had trouble looking kindly at a person who made
                    that kind of statement as to how he viewed the Agency.</p>
                <p>So I took part in these meetings of the inner circle, many of which were designed
                    to try to figure out how to tear the Agency apart. And of course my role was to
                    try to moderate that, at least to the extent that it didn't tear down something
                    constructive that had been built up over many years. It was to John's credit
                    that he almost always included me in those inner circle meetings, and I was
                    always free to say to him anything I wanted as to my opinion, even though it may
                    be totally in disagreement with the group. We had a good personal relationship
                    at all times. He was a man without rancor, he never held personal grudges, and
                    one could be quite open and frank with him, even when one was telling him he'd
                    done something quite silly or inappropriate. But at any rate I felt a little
                    like the Dutch boy holding his finger in the dike.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>Van Dyke quit in six months. He decided that they had not been able to make the
                    changes that he thought were a part of the Carter mandate, and therefore he
                    didn't want any part of what happened after that and therefore he left. Which of
                    course improved the situation immensely. While I had no objection to change, I
                    will say that the attitude of some of the people in this group was a really
                    quite destructive. One of the issues as I remember, related to the hiring of
                    people. I have always placed very high importance on management's role in
                    hiring, promoting and dismissing people. I've always thought that good judgments
                    on these points will improve an organization's performance as much as any
                    operational judgments that are made while you're running the place. Therefore
                    one of my roles was to try to keep the new people from hiring totally
                    inappropriate people in the positions where they had the option to do so. Of
                    course, I didn't have much say about the Assistant Administrator level, which
                    was decided pretty much by the transition team at the same time I was being
                    chosen. But there was still the choice of other people further down the line in
                    those 300 AD positions. Not all of these were open, that is, some of these
                    positions were filled with career people who had carried over. Nevertheless,
                    there was some latitude to bring in other people. The new team wanted to do
                    that, which is understandable, but my job was to try to see that the people they
                    brought in were qualified for the work that needed to be done.</p>
                <p>One of the other policies of the new Administration was to review those 300 AD
                    positions to be sure that any that were filled with Republican holdovers were
                    dismissed as promptly as possible. And that was part of the program - to free up
                    some positions so they could be filled with others of their choice. I recall the
                    Assistant Administrator for Latin America was a Hispanic American who was an
                    extremely intelligent, bright, young (I think he was about 36 years old) lawyer
                    who had been working in Washington, DC, but the only problem with him was that
                    he felt that his main role in the Agency was to bring in and promote Hispanic
                    Americans. That was his overriding objective , which is fine in its own right,
                    but sometimes the people he wanted to employ really weren't qualified.</p>
                <p>I recall one case where a Hispanic American with a background as a salesman of
                    cyclone fences in Los Angeles had lost his job, and the Assistant Administrator
                    wanted to bring him in as a Mission Director or Deputy Mission Director of an
                    overseas mission, when he had no overseas experience, no economic background, no
                    professional background whatsoever, and not even a management background. I
                    recall saying to the young Assistant Administrator that he simply wasn't
                    qualified, and his reply was, “Well I'm not qualified either, so if I can be
                    Assistant Administrator without being qualified, why does someone lower than I
                    am have to be qualified?” Nevertheless I was able to keep that particular
                    selection from being made, and hopefully kept a semblance of professionalism in
                    the ranks during this trying period.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>Over time, a number of the people who came into AID with these highly prejudicial
                    attitudes changed their views and adapted to the system, and some of them
                    learned something about the development business. And others left, so that
                    within a year or two, the tension that came from this shock of people coming in
                    with that set of attitudes was lessened. It was not an easy process,
                    however.</p>
                <p>As far as Gilligan himself, in his first year he kept trying to make changes as
                    best he could. But he didn't understand the protections provided by the civil
                    service, and the new group couldn't understand why they weren't simply able to
                    dismiss people. The foreign service is not as protective as the civil service,
                    but nevertheless there are some protections there. And John, in hoping to find
                    some way, simply thought if he could find someone clever enough, they could find
                    a way to carry out the dismissals he wanted to do. It wasn't that he was aiming
                    at any individual people, he just felt that there should be a big shakeup.</p>
                <p>I recall one interesting episode when he went out to look for a chief personnel
                    person throughout the U.S. government. He was trying to find someone who could
                    understand the system well enough and could advise him how to carry out the
                    personnel changes he wanted. He finally located someone who promised him that it
                    could be done. John offered him a job on the spot. In this case it was done
                    without my having been consulted. I only learned about it after the offer had
                    been made when John told me what he'd done and showed me the man's biodata.</p>
                <p>Within the next 24 hours I did a lot of checking and found the man was a liar and
                    a misrepresenter with an absolutely terrible record, and was able to get this
                    information to John, who was persuaded to change his mind. He withdrew his offer
                    to the man, with some considerable embarrassment, but hopefully to the benefit
                    of the Agency. The man was simply telling John things that could be done in the
                    civil service that weren't true in an effort to secure the job. And of course
                    John's offer had been oral, not in writing, and he was able to retract it. But
                    it was an example of Gilligan's shooting from the hip and then having to scurry
                    around trying to get out of a jam.</p>
                <p>There's one more incident that falls into this whole category of personnel
                    relations. While John was saying all these things about AID and having the
                    pejorative view that he did, for some reason he didn't seem to recognize that
                    this might have some effect on morale, or some effect on the way people felt
                    about him. After about one year, in the house newspaper called “Frontlines,” he
                    wrote a little memorandum and said he'd been there about a year and he wanted
                    the staff to rate him, to see how, he wanted them to tell him how he'd done in
                    his first year in office.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>As you know it's the system both in the foreign service and the civil service
                    that every year a supervisor writes a report on the people under his
                    supervision, and they are able to discuss this with him. And John, being a true
                    democrat and hail fellow well met, wanted to reverse the process and do some
                    bottom-up management and get feedback from the staff about his performance. What
                    he got back from the 20% who had the nerve to answer was so shocking to him that
                    he simply couldn't grasp the fact that what he'd been doing had been perceived
                    by the staff as an absolutely terrible job. He called the five or six people in
                    the inner circle and myself, on a Sunday morning, to his house to discuss the
                    feedback that had come from this survey. He was shocked to learn the impact that
                    his remarks had made, and the effect it had had on the staff. But the replies
                    did make him realize that what he'd been doing was thoughtless and careless and
                    not very sound.</p>
                <p>Another thing was happening in that first year. He brought in one person who was
                    not exactly part of the inner circle but was very close to John. I can't
                    remember what his background was, but he did have some background in development
                    work. John gave this fellow a lot of latitude to look around, to visit missions
                    abroad, to talk to staff, and to report to him on his impressions of AID. This
                    man's name was George something, I can't remember the last name. At any rate,
                    George was a very sensible and level-headed fellow, and in the course of his
                    travels and investigations, what he was feeding back to Gilligan and ultimately
                    concluded after about a year, was that the AID organization was a serious one
                    with highly experienced professionals who were hard-working and doing as good a
                    job as possible under the circumstances in which they operated.</p>
                <p>George's reports were beginning to have an effect on John at the same time that
                    the survey results were calling him to task for his thoughtless comments and his
                    attitudes towards AID. So he went through a kind of conversion over the next
                    several months in which he changed his view of the Agency, I think for sound
                    reasons, and began acting in a more professional way himself in the way he ran
                    the Agency. I will say incidentally, that all of the things he did at any point
                    from the first to the last were never done with the least bit of nastiness or
                    vituperativeness. It was always done in a kind of open and even good-humored
                    way; it simply was thoughtless, but there was just no nastiness about it. John
                    was always a very nice person and this is why our personal relations could be
                    good throughout this whole period when he was doing things that I totally
                    disagreed with. In some cases he would accept my advice and moderate his
                    behavior, but I couldn't control him every minute of the day, in fact I didn't
                    control him very much at all but I could influence some decisions once in a
                    while.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>At any rate, the Agency went through a very trying period at that time but
                    somehow it survived and eventually pulled through. But then at the end of two
                    years John's tendency to shoot from the hip finally did him in. He was in some
                    public forum where he made some remarks about U.S. policy towards Israel, or
                    something about which he had no business even having an opinion on the subject,
                    and this was quoted widely in the press. The Secretary of State promptly went to
                    the White House and said “Please remove this fellow, he's making intemperate
                    remarks about things that affect our foreign policy.” And Gilligan was out
                    within a matter of hours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall he was making very critical remarks about the
                        level of aid to Egypt and Israel and that whole Supporting Assistance or
                        economic...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I think the incident that caused his dismissal had nothing to do with aid
                    levels. It wasn't even on the subject of aid. It was more general foreign
                    policy, and therefore even more inappropriate. It would also have been
                    inappropriate to take issue with the level of aid the Administration had decided
                    to give, but it wasn't even as aid-related as that. At any rate, the Secretary
                    at that time didn't think it was an appropriate thing for an AID Administrator
                    to say, and the result was that John left us in great haste.</p>
                <p>And then I was Acting Administrator for six to eight months while they searched
                    for a replacement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: It was in 1979. He left about February or March of '79. I ran the Agency
                    until September when Doug Bennet came in and took over as Administrator, and
                    then I resigned on December 31, 1979.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well we don't want to jump too far ahead, but since you
                        mentioned it, was there a particular reason why you resigned at that point?
                        Was there...wanting a change, was the Administration wanting a change?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>NOOTER: One of the reasons for my resignation was that I was qualified for
                    retirement under AID's rules that allow retirement at a relatively early age. I
                    thought it was not likely that the Democrats would be reelected, and I thought
                    that it was unlikely that I would succeed in making the transition to another
                    Administration of a different party. I had done that three previous times, but
                    the higher you go in the Government, the harder it is to make those transitions,
                    and I doubted I would make the next transition. As it turned out, the Democrats
                    weren't reelected but Peter McPherson was appointed Administrator. I knew Peter
                    very well and I might have remained, at least for a while as Deputy
                    Administrator with Peter, with whom I was on extremely good terms. However,
                    after having testified before Congress for eleven years, and gone through all
                    the travail of the Deputy Administratorship during the Gilligan era, I decided
                    it was a good time to change. I said earlier that my Middle East job was the
                    most satisfying, but the Deputy Administrator job was the least pleasant,
                    perhaps in part because of the tensions and difficulties of the Gilligan period,
                    partly because the Deputy Administrator doesn't directly run operational
                    programs. He gets all the nasty jobs in the Agency nobody else wants, all of the
                    equal employment opportunity problems, the appeals of firings, and so it wasn't
                    nearly as enjoyable as running a Regional Bureau.</p>
                <p>In that job I think the most useful thing I did, besides trying to mitigate the
                    original Gilligan views, was in the personnel area. As I mentioned, I always
                    placed a high premium on personnel choices. I thought that if an organization
                    gives good people the best possible opportunity to function and tries to
                    eliminate the people who are nonproducers and are dragging down the system,
                    that's the best way to make an organization functional. Within a civil service
                    or a quasi-civil service such as the foreign service, of course your options are
                    limited. Your ability to hire is limited, your ability to make other personnel
                    choices is limited. Within the AID system it was especially limited in the
                    ability to give promotions. In the foreign service system, promotions are given
                    by panels of people who are appointed, including some from the outside and some
                    from the inside, and promotions are decided on the basis of the supervisor's
                    ratings in the person's personnel file. Management has no direct role in making
                    promotion choices within the foreign service. However, management did have a
                    significant role in placing people in positions in the foreign service, that is,
                    the choice of Mission Directors, Deputy Mission Directors, and key senior
                    positions was either made by or approved by the Administrator or Deputy
                    Administrator.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>It was my objective to do several things: one, to try to be sure that the new
                    people we were hiring as young professionals were the most qualified people that
                    we could get. And also that the placement of people were the best possible
                    choices that we could get for our senior management positions. I kept a list of
                    two or three hundred names of people within the Agency whom I thought were
                    particularly outstanding. I had a kind of informal network of people who were
                    professionals in the Agency whose judgements I particularly valued as to their
                    views of who was most or least qualified, because in a worldwide system it's
                    difficult to know everyone yourself, as you would in a smaller organization or
                    in an organization in one location. I hoped through this system of becoming
                    heavily involved in these choices to be able to assure that the best people were
                    in the most responsible positions. It ultimately would help their promotion
                    chances also, because the record would reflect the level of their
                    responsibilities. If a relatively junior person was placed in a position of
                    Deputy Mission Director, the panel would review that and see that he had done a
                    good job even though he was only at a low grade level. If he were only an FSR-4
                    instead of the usual 2 or 3, then he must be a good person, and therefore he
                    would have a better chance of being promoted. So we were able indirectly to
                    influence the promotion system, although those panels met only once a year and
                    so it was a long term process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you try to address the system at all as opposed to
                        individual...to change the system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: No, because I didn't think you could change the system. The panel system
                    is similar to that used in the State Department; it's been established for many
                    years and is set up to ensure impartiality. I didn't think it was feasible or
                    practical to try to change the system. It was more a matter of learning how to
                    operate within that system to make it produce desirable results.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the civil service system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: The Civil Service had a different set of rules. There your options were
                    more limited, it was more rigid. I can't remember the details, but of course we
                    tried to influence the choices there also. The use of the AD positions, where
                    you did have some leeway for placing people, was one way that you could maneuver
                    or influence the personnel system somewhat. The Civil Service rigidities, of
                    course, cause most of the management in government to gnash their teeth about
                    them. At the same time, having lived through the Gilligan period, some of those
                    rigidities are worth putting up with if it prevents some group of wild men from
                    coming in and wrecking an organization overnight. But the system is rigid and it
                    is difficult to operate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that role you obviously must have had a lot of dealings
                        with very top people in the State Department and the White House. What was

                <p>NOOTER: Sometimes as Deputy Administrator, and even more as Acting Administrator,
                    I would sit in on the Secretary's weekly staff meeting that the Secretary of
                    State would have for senior people in State and related organizations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Secretary of State at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: It was Cyrus Vance. I had a lot of respect for Cyrus Vance, I thought he
                    was an excellent person. Yes, I worked very closely with State. I sat in on NSC
                    meetings that were on subjects relevant to countries where the AID program was
                    significant. Brzezinski was the head of the NSC under Carter, and those meetings
                    were quite interesting to say the least.</p>

                <p>NOOTER: I might have sat in on four or five NSC meetings but they were on
                    specific subjects, El Salvador, for example. Was it going to survive? I recall
                    the head of the CIA at that time predicting that El Salvador would go Communist
                    within the next one or two months, which of course never took place. But AID was
                    not the center of the discussion. I was simply a participant to represent the
                    organization on a subject that was under discussion at the time.</p>

                <p>NOOTER: I don't think that ever was the subject of a NSC discussion that I took

                <p>NOOTER: I saw many attempts to review whether AID should be reorganized and in
                    what way, and I came to admire the foresight of the people who set up the
                    relationship between AID and State that they did in 1961. It survived for so
                    many years because it was in fact probably the best compromise that could be
                    made between the diverse interests of AID and State and the interests of the
                    other agencies involved in foreign aid.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>Many of the AID professionals thought that AID should be a separate organization,
                    that they shouldn't have to deal with political considerations. On the other
                    hand, that's not realistic in the sense that aid from a government to another
                    country is bound to be political whether you want it to be or not. And there is
                    an appropriate role for State in that process, there has to be. There are also
                    roles for other agencies such as the Department of Agriculture on PL 480, the
                    Treasury when it involves the transfer of funds, the Bureau of the Budget and so
                    on. All of these organizations have a legitimate interest in the AID program in
                    one way or another. And the problem is to balance those interests in a way that
                    doesn't completely bog down the operations. That just requires a lot of skill.
                    I've come to have respect for the term “good bureaucrat.” A “good bureaucrat” is
                    someone who knows how to manipulate within those constraints and do an effective
                    job in spite of the fact that he's balancing a lot of diverse interests and a
                    lot of different views. The system breaks down if any one part of the clearance
                    process or any one of the participating agencies tries to assume more authority
                    than its legitimate share, whether that be State or Agriculture or Defense or
                    whatever. And once in a while some individual would come along who would, on a
                    personal basis, try to extend his authority beyond what his legitimate
                    organizational role should be and that would cause problems.</p>
                <p>It was always interesting to see what happens to the informal functional
                    relationships that exist in the transition of one Administration to another when
                    presidencies changed. The government functions on a day to day basis because of
                    a web of relationships that are set up between people in different
                    organizations, and when the Government changes, often those webs are broken down
                    because the personnel change or shift around. And then it'll take a period of
                    time before those networks are reestablished, the informal networks are
                    developed. I don't know that there's any way around that except to recognize
                    that this process is going on and to try to facilitate the establishment of
                    these relationships as quickly as possible.</p>
                <p>Generally my relations with State were always good. I had respect for the State
                    viewpoint in most cases. Most of the State people I worked with were responsible
                    and trying to do a serious job. They may or may not have always had the same
                    view as AID, but nevertheless they had legitimate views considering their
                    responsibilities.</p>
                <p>Concluding observations on AID and international development</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a period when, you may want to come to this
                        later, you were Deputy Administrator, and there was a major shift toward
                        making human rights an issue. What were your views?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>NOOTER: The Carter Administration brought with it the notion of human rights as
                    an important issue of interest to governments. I recall that the politically
                    appointed Deputy Secretary of State at that time was testifying before the House
                    Foreign Relations Committee. I was there as a supporting witness when the first
                    questions came from the Committee about human rights, and it took the witness
                    totally by surprise because this had not been on the agenda before. I believe
                    Robert Ingersoll was the chief witness, and he simply did not know how to deal
                    with the question. Of course, a lot of things have happened since then, but how
                    the Government mixes its more conventional interests in foreign affairs with
                    human and moral issues has not yet been resolved, and I won't try to resolve it
                    during this oral presentation.</p>
                <p>I will comment on a related subject that evolved in the 70s, which had to do with
                    the emphasis that was put on poverty as a major objective of the development
                    program. As I observed it, the notion that AID should place an increasing amount
                    of attention to doing programs that helped lower income people in the countries
                    where it was working was really an idea originated by Jim Grant. Jim had been in
                    AID and its predecessor agencies for many years, and had been incidentally the
                    Assistant Administrator for Vietnam immediately before me. I'd known him ever
                    since I came into AID in 1962 and had a lot of respect for him. Nancy knew
                    Ethel, his wife. Ethel had been part of the orientation program that Nancy
                    attended when we first came into the Agency. Jim left AID in 1969 to become the
                    head of the Overseas Development Council, which was established to try to
                    promote aid and to increase aid levels because Jim felt that aid was an
                    important thing for the Government to do. Jim thought that by placing emphasis
                    on the humanitarian aspect of aid he could garner additional support for it, and
                    so he developed the concept of development aid concentrating on poverty as one
                    way to do that. I think Jim also felt sincerely that this was important to do
                    for its own sake, also.</p>
                <p>My observation of it was that it was a valid idea, but is extraordinarily
                    difficult to do effectively, and often it takes weird turns as the policy goes
                    down through the bureaucratic system. Because the job of providing aid in a way
                    that increases economic growth is extraordinarily difficult in the first
                    instance. When you add to it that you're going to do it in a very selective way
                    aimed at a very special group, it's extremely hard to do, even in our own
                    country for example, where the Great Society programs frequently failed.</p>
                <p>I recall that this idea gained support on the Hill in 1974 or '75. AID, in trying
                    to demonstrate to Congress that it was taking this directive seriously,
                    appointed a special staff in the central Program Office to be sure that all the
                    projects gave as much emphasis to poverty issues. And I recall that we were
                    trying to prepare a project in Yemen to increase poultry production. The
                    administrative decision from the Program Office was that we couldn't assist any
                    farmer who had more than 100 chickens because he wouldn't be at a low enough
                    income level to meet the poverty objectives. You can't blame Jim Grant for that
                    decision, but an idea that has a lofty sound and a good general objective often
                    takes bizarre turns when it gets down to the operational level.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall one part of Jim Grant's pitch was that
                        trickle-down wasn't working, the general economic growth, the private
                        sector, the infrastructure was not addressing the needs therefore you had to
                        be more direct in the human needs program? The other end, you might want to
                        comment on that, and then the other concern on the lines you were just
                        talking about was the phrase “the poorest of the poor” which in my
                        understanding was never the intent of the legislation but became the
                        language of the day. Maybe you want to elaborate on those two points.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I share the skepticism that's expressed in the way you phrase your
                    question. The phrase “poorest of the poor” evolved out of the discussion
                    somehow, and I don't think Jim had that in mind. Also, when you're dealing with
                    a country where the average per capita income is $250 or $150, of course there
                    are some rich people in those countries, and of course we don't want to run our
                    programs in a way that simply enriches the richest. Having said that, to try to
                    pinpoint the poorest is a fool's errand and simply isn't administratively
                    feasible in most cases. If we're doing refugee programs, then we can provide
                    food aid that goes directly to the poorest people. That's certainly one thing
                    that can be done, but that's not development, that's a bandaid. It's extremely
                    important sometimes, but it's simply not a development program. The objective of
                    the program should be to achieve self-sustaining growth from which all parts of
                    the society can develop, and it is almost always accompanied by a greater
                    concentration of wealth in its early stages, as was the case in the United
                    States in the late 1800s.</p>
                <p>I think once we take our eye off the ball of how we transform a country from
                    being a non-growth country to being one that's able to generate savings and
                    investment and proceed to start along a growth path, which is what the objective
                    of the program should be, we reduce the chances of accomplishing that objective.
                    Within that context, we also need to look at income distribution and policies
                    that try to promote equity to the greatest possible extent. But you can't do the
                    second while ignoring the first, which should be our principle objective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another issue of course during your time both before you
                        became Deputy Administrator and during was this swing back and forth about
                        the importance of the private sector.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: In the 70s there was more emphasis put on working with the private sector
                    . That grew enormously in the 80s and the 90s, and I think our understanding of
                    how to do it is a lot better than it was in the 70s when I was in AID. A number
                    of the attempts in the 70s were somewhat naive and misdirected. My own view is
                    that the emphasis on the development of the private sector is completely
                    appropriate.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>Then the question is what are the things that are most important for that. Of
                    course I've worked in the private sector before joining AID. I'm familiar with
                    motives and incentives in the private sector. Often the things that are
                    important to do for the private sector are the things that create the conditions
                    in which the private sector can function rather than aid dollars that flow
                    directly to the private sector. In other words, it's the policies of the
                    government, it's whether there is an infrastructure and a setting in which the
                    private sector can function, whether there's a functional banking system,
                    whether there's a legal system that permits the enforcement of contracts.
                    Probably the least important is making money available directly to the private
                    sector. We have had some successful programs where AID money was channeled
                    directly to the private sector, but that's better done by a banking system. The
                    bankers are the ones who should make the judgments about what businesses are a
                    reasonable credit risk. Bureaucrats don't make commercial judgements very well
                    and they shouldn't be put in the position of having to any more of it than
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the small enterprise , what you call the micro
                        enterprise money in private sector activity and the non-formal sector that
                        has been...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Encouraging small enterprises is extremely important, but we have even
                    more trouble when we try to put money directly into the small enterprises. My
                    own view is that the small end of the private sector is the most important in
                    development. The important thing is to develop a lot of small industries that
                    can grow if they're successful and expand and can move into areas where there's
                    an economic advantage based on market choices. Borrowers in developing countries
                    often tend to feel they don't have to repay when they take a loan from the
                    government, and the government has a hard time foreclosing. It seems to me that
                    these are things that should be done by private banks, not by government
                    bureaucrats or by aid organizations. At the same time, the conditions under
                    which the small businesses operate are something that AID programs can
                    influence. The World Bank can do that a lot better than AID because it's a
                    bigger, more powerful organization.</p>
                <p>I was in Kenya speaking to a friend of ours who had a farm there. He wanted to
                    have four or five rooms he could rent out to people on a commercial basis as a
                    way of adding to his farm income. However, he found that it would take licenses
                    from 16 different organizations in the Kenyan Government to be able to do that.
                    And he knew also that it would require bribes to most of those organizations in
                    order to get the licenses or the approval, and so he simply decided not to build
                    the rooms. So the structure that was set up was so inhibiting to private
                    investment and to development. He didn't need money to build the rooms; he could
                    get the money to do that. He had the skills, this was a low-technology
                    operation. But the government structure was such that it discouraged him before
                    he even started.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>That's an example of what in the trade we call the “investment climate,” which
                    governments create and can do something to improve if they wish. And sometimes
                    we as aid donors can influence the governments in that direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One other point in another direction, I'm sure you'll have
                        points you'll want to bring out, in back of this other relationship the
                        State Department and the political role, developmental interests and their
                        ...communist threat. In the statement the State Department says we've got to
                        have that level of aid for this reason or we've got to assist this
                        situation...for conditions to implement. Did you find that...has the AID
                        program really been helping in supporting foreign policy and has it
                        compromised therefore the developmental effort? How would you square these
                        sometimes but maybe not always conflicting objectives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: It's difficult to generalize because it's a balancing of interests that
                    are legitimate. Sometimes it's handled well and sometimes it's handled poorly. I
                    guess that you could say that the aid that we gave to Korea after the Korean
                    War, which might have been viewed in the 50s as largely wasted, ultimately
                    resulted in an extremely successful Korean economy now. If we want to think of
                    it in Cold War terms, it became a bulwark, but even if we think of it in
                    development terms, it is highly successful and is an example to its northern
                    neighbor of what it could achieve under a different economic system.</p>
                <p>In viewing whether aid has been successful or not, I've found it to be the most
                    useful to look at what's happened to countries in the world since the end of
                    World War II, and which ones have emerged and developed and gone on to be
                    prosperous. The record on that basis is really quite promising. And I will
                    hasten to say that it's difficult to say that AID's role was critical to those
                    successes. If you go back to World War II, you find Spain and Greece evolving in
                    this way and Portugal. These were thought of as underdeveloped countries 50
                    years ago. You've had a good part of Asia become “tigers,” highly developed and
                    models for development. Indonesia is making quite important strides and
                    Thailand. Latin America, which was troublesome for years and dominated by
                    dictators is now largely democratic and a lot of it is economically successful.
                    You still have extremely troublesome places from an economic viewpoint around
                    the world: most of Africa is still in the doldrums, but on the whole the record
                    of countries that have made the transition to sustained development is quite
                    impressive.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you share the view that sometimes where the level of

                        preserving some sort of political reform, even though it was jeopardizing
                        the quality of the program because you could not apply conditions to it,

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time you were involved in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I don't think there was any great pressure to maintain a high level of
                    aid. The amounts weren't so high, and we did exercise some leverage there. There
                    was an IMF program that we supported. In the middle 60s the Liberian performance
                    was influenced in a positive way by the pressures we were able to bear. Those
                    weren't overwhelming pressures but we were able to coax them into reasonably
                    good behavior. Had they continued along that track for enough years I think that
                    Liberia would eventually have made some progress although it suffers from many
                    of the problems that the rest of Africa suffers from in terms of a shortage of
                    human resources.</p>
                <p>No Egypt is the case where no doubt the aid that was given could have been more
                    effective without the political constraints, but I really stopped looking at
                    Egypt in detail in about 1977. I would expect that the large levels of aid that
                    go to Egypt represent a great deal of waste because they're supporting policies
                    that aren't conducive to creating investment and increasing productivity. As I
                    mentioned, it was the threat of a decline in aid the Korean program that led to
                    the Korean turnaround. That was not an artificial threat, it was simply a
                    prognostication that U.S. support for Korea wouldn't sustain the high levels of
                    aid that they'd been getting. And faced with that reality the Koreans were smart
                    enough to know that they'd better try to get their house in order.</p>
                <p>On the relationship between AID and State, there was a curious period in the late
                    70s when Hubert Humphrey, who was always a big supporter of the AID program,
                    thought that he would help us by creating an organization that would make AID
                    somewhat more distant from State, somewhat more independent. I don't remember
                    the acronyms now, but there was enacted into law during the Carter years an
                    organizational arrangement...</p>

                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>NOOTER: IDCA yes...an organization called IDCA that was to be in charge of all of
                    the foreign assistance elements in the Government including AID, PL 480 and I
                    don't know what else, but that was the intention, and it would create some
                    additional independence of AID from State. The actual fact was that it wasn't
                    successful in bringing any extra leadership to the other aid organizations and
                    so IDCA was simply a new piece of bureaucracy that sat on top of AID and created
                    a new set of guidelines and policy papers and so on. It was never a very large
                    organization, but it was completely redundant and as I saw it, totally useless.
                    I think that ultimately this was resolved either by changing the legislation or
                    simply appointing the same person to be the head of IDCA and AID. As I said,
                    Humphrey was trying to be helpful to AID by separating AID from State, but in
                    fact this only created a bureaucratic nightmare that eventually had to be worked
                    out of.</p>

                        President. Of course the bureaucratic situation was that no one in Treasury,

                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: That's right, these other agencies simply operated under authorities,
                    which gave the power to them and the system never functioned. So this attempt to
                    separate from State didn't work. State insisted on having at least some hand in
                    the policy aspects of the AID program. The fact that AID was under State but at
                    the level of the Secretary, I always thought was quite a successful arrangement.
                    That is, we knew that within AID, State was going to have some influence but on
                    a day to day basis, the State people also knew that they couldn't appeal every
                    little decision up to the Secretary and so compromises had to be struck based on
                    our various interests.</p>
                <p>The same thing was true in the overseas missions. Ambassadors during the Kennedy
                    years were put in full charge of all the U.S. Government operations in that
                    country, initially with the exception of the CIA, but I think that may have
                    changed later. In any event the AID Mission Director knew he had to live with
                    the ambassador, and that relationship was either good or bad depending on the
                    character of the individuals. But the fact was there were legitimate interests
                    on both sides that had to be served. And to simply say that the AID Mission
                    Director could ignore what was going on at the Embassy would be naive. At the
                    same time, ambassadors who tried to run the AID program would give the AID
                    people fits and could cause all sorts of problems. But those were the exception
                    rather than the rule.</p>

                    contact with State when I was Assistant Administrator, and of course when I was
                    in the field, where I knew it was in all of our interests to have a good
                    relationship between the AID mission and the embassy.</p>

                        worked within the World Bank, how would you reflect on it as an
                        organization, its effectiveness...over the time you saw it from the
                        beginning of AID to the present, what kind of sense do you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: AID in the 60s and in the 70s was an extremely effective organization. It
                    had its problems, partly because of Vietnam, partly because of the Gilligan
                    years, morale problems and so on, but on the whole it had a very serious-minded
                    group of people trying to do a good job. One of the reasons for that was that
                    the work itself was so challenging and so fascinating. It tended to attract good
                    people and to hold their interest, and often people in Washington and even more
                    abroad could become totally dedicated to their work because the nature of the
                    work was so interesting. When you're meeting with the Minister of Finance for a
                    country, trying to help him improve the livelihood of his people, and if you see
                    that you have made some contribution to that, it is extremely rewarding.</p>
                <p>I gather in the last 10 years or so, AID has been going through more
                    politicization at the political appointment level than we did when I was there
                    and that that has caused some serious morale and operational problems. But I
                    really don't have any first-hand experience of that. Incidentally, I also felt
                    that the strong management that I mentioned in the 60s, which held over to a
                    good extent into the 70s, was able to bring up and promote and encourage a
                    younger group that was quite competent. Then in the 70s we began to be able to
                    hire young professionals with former Peace Corps experience, which was excellent
                    overseas experience combined with a sense of dedication. This gave the Agency a
                    manpower pool that survived for a long time in the face of serious management
                    problems that came later. I don't know how long that manpower pool will last or
                    has lasted. It won't last forever, eventually the good people will leave and if
                    they're sufficiently discouraged they'll leave sooner. Early retirement policies
                    are really a detriment to the future of the Agency, and some of the special
                    provisions that encouraged people to retire even in their 40s was to my mind
                    kind of ridiculous. Anyway, I do think that what happened in those years was to
                    create an organization with a lot of qualified people doing a serious job.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came in under Kennedy, you spoke with a lot of

                <p>NOOTER: I think that the excitement of the Kennedy years was never matched at any
                    later period. I recall during the Johnson years there was a cutback in which
                    half the lights in the hall of the State Department were dimmed in order to save
                    electricity, which probably saved about $5 a year but it made the place look
                    like a half-dead institution. Guards were instituted to make it extremely
                    difficult to get into. A certain sense of shabbiness came into the offices as
                    budget cuts and restrictions took place. Those were minor things but they did
                    reflect some of the change in attitude from the earlier period.</p>

                <p>NOOTER: Of course the whole United States went through an enormous social
                    upheaval in the late 60s and early 70s that we're still recovering from and that
                    took its toll. You commented earlier on the Vietnam period. I didn't give the
                    full flavor of the sense of sitting in the State Department while there were
                    demonstrations going on outside. Our children were beginning to use drugs and
                    losing respect for the older generation for what they saw were the errors of our
                    ways. All of those things affected the morale of the nation at all levels. But
                    having said that, AID carried on in a serious way to try to do its work.</p>

                        director and Assistant Administrator and Deputy Administrator what would you
                        summarize as, what works in development or why does it work? What are the
                        factors that people should be, or the universal truths if there are such a
                        thing in the development process, in your experience, to pass on to
                        others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I've thought for a number of years that the overall objective of the
                    development program is to free up the energies of the people in the countries
                    that it's assisting with. Development is all a matter of the productivity of the
                    people in the country. Now the question is how do you do that. I think we've
                    learned a great deal. The break-up of the Soviet Union confirmed what the better
                    economists had been saying, and that is that one has to reduce the level of
                    regulation and government intrusion. One has to set an environment in which the
                    private sector can work, but when we say private sector, I'm talking about
                    individuals as well as corporations. And then the level of response that one
                    gets depends on those individuals, it depends to some extent on the cultural
                    background of the people you're working with. This doesn't mean that the
                    cultural factors can't change, but they change rather slowly and
                    begrudgingly.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>Nevertheless, people everywhere respond to economic incentives. We've seen as the
                    Soviet Union broke up that parts of the Soviet Union that were willing to open
                    up their systems, establish a sensible exchange rate and create a market economy
                    where prices set the level for goods and people could invest and make choices
                    and so on, even though they'd been under a highly socialized system for 70
                    years, respond rather quickly.</p>
                <p>The way we think of this in economic terms is get the macroeconomic policies
                    correct, to get the environment in which businesses function correct in terms of
                    the legal system, the financial system, a realistic exchange rate, a budget that
                    doesn't create unnecessary inflation, and then the economy will evolve. In
                    addition to that we can do some things to help the transfer of technology. Some
                    of that - maybe the most important part - is done by private investors who
                    invest abroad and bring their technology with them. But once in a while we can
                    help with the development of an IR-8 rice variety or a high-yielding wheat that
                    will make a massive difference to millions of people, or maybe we can support a
                    measles vaccination program that will eradicate measles.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: Undoubtedly it's when a country itself begins to function in a way that
                    indicates self-sustaining development as Korea did, as Taiwan did, maybe with
                    some guidance from us or from international organizations. When a country
                    transforms its policies in a way that its people can function on the basis of
                    responding to market incentives so that they produce because they know they'll
                    get the benefits of their labor. I don't think it's any more mysterious than
                    that. The question is...</p>

                <p>NOOTER: ...that's right. I wrote a paper recently that made the point that if we
                    program balance of payments aid when the conditions aren't right to assure that
                    it is absorbed as investment rather than consumption, we will be harming the
                    situation rather than helping it. That may be getting a little technical for
                    this oral presentation, but it's a little like the Dutch disease. If you strike
                    oil and you suddenly get a lot of oil income, the fact that you can import goods
                    cheaply because of the oil revenue means that this will depress the rest of the
                    economy, and this of course is exactly what's happened in Nigeria the way
                    they've managed their oil money. They've suppressed their agriculture; they've
                    replaced it with oil production, but the oil revenues are not evenly distributed
                    throughout the country.</p>

                    Thailand, and Indonesia. The encouragement of India to adopt a correct wheat
                    price policy was important, the development of land grant colleges in India,
                    which gave India the ability to do agricultural research so that they could keep
                    up with agricultural development in their own country. That's been totally
                    self-sufficient for years but was originally an AID program, which was very
                    successful. Then there are odd little pockets of success such as Ethiopian
                    Airlines where they run a very successful airline in spite of all the years of
                    general government mismanagement that's gone on there. Some programs have
                    certainly crashed, some of them have been lost in history. Some have had
                    unintended consequences of the kind we mentioned before, unintended consequences
                    from programs that may have looked like failures, but turned out to be
                    successes. Some have made a general contribution to human resource development,
                    the development of the people of a country which could only be realized when the
                    country's policies got on a wavelength that allowed these people to function. So
                    it's very difficult to measure the precise effect of it; I guess I have little
                    doubt that it's had a salutary effect around the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Given some of the skeptics about foreign assistance and so
                        on, I believe you mentioned the Korea case was the most successful one
                        besides ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I have to point to Korea as a case in point. This was a large program in
                    the 50s, perhaps $300 million a year, a lot of which in 1960 would have looked
                    as though it was wasted. By 1970 you had a country that was on its way to
                    extremely successful development, highly self-motivated, no longer on the AID
                    program, except there may have still been a little PL 480. It has transformed
                    the country over, say, a 15 year period starting in 1954 or '55 till 1970. You
                    had a transformation from a country that was an economic disaster to one that
                    was on the way to being one of the world's big success stories. And it was the
                    threat of the reduction of aid that played a role in it, but had there been no
                    aid at all in the 50's they might still look like Laos.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Suppose an AID person comes to you and says “I'm going out
                        to be the new mission director in a country.” What advice would you give
                        this person going out for the first time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I would say, first come to know your country, understand the country that
                    you're working with, understand what makes it tick, understand its weaknesses
                    and its strengths. Second, understand your own program possibilities. That is,
                    what is the level and the kind of assistance that you're able to provide. And
                    then, decide how to apply that in an effective way, and of course AID can do
                    many different kinds of things. I'm now used to working with the World Bank
                    where we go for the jugular, that is, we go in and say, “How can a country
                    transform itself to become a turn-around country?” But if I were with a
                    volunteer agency, an NGO, and I had a relatively small amount of resources, I'd
                    be looking for a way to target that to some specific attainable objective. I
                    wouldn't be trying to tell the government how to run their macroeconomic
                    policies. So it depends upon what your resources are.</p>
                <p>I would also advise a great deal of modesty about what role we would be playing
                    and should be playing in someone else's country. We are, when we're abroad in
                    one way or another, guests of these countries. They may tolerate us a little
                    more than they would normally if we have some money in our pocket, but the fact
                    is we're still foreigners in their country, it's still their place, and they are
                    the ones who should ultimately make the decisions about how to run their lives.
                    We can try to inform them about what we think will work. I have almost never
                    couched conditions on aid in terms of the fact that they had to be done in order
                    to get the money. I've always tried to couch them in terms of why those actions
                    would be good for the country, whether there was any aid involved or not. And in
                    fact we shouldn't have any conditions that aren't good for the country.
                    Therefore if you say, “You have to do this because AID or the World Bank says
                    that you have to in order to get the aid”, to my mind you might as well stay
                    home.</p>
                <p>The recipient should understand why that condition will improve his situation.
                    It's something we should try to convince them to do whether we give them aid or
                    not. So we should recognize our role as a foreigner, as an outsider, as someone
                    who's come to try to be helpful, but not to run their country for them. At the
                    same time, we do have an obligation, if we're going to provide aid, to provide
                    it only if we think it's going to be useful, and if we have a country where the
                    conditions are such that the aid will be wasted, then we should decide to
                    withhold it, and that's a perfectly valid position.</p>
                <p>You mentioned human rights, you mentioned poverty and so on. Maybe for our own
                    conscience we have to give these consideration. However, I do think we have to
                    be careful not to be projecting our values on other societies, especially where
                    those values are more in the order of fads than deep-seated cultural values.
                    There are some aspects of human rights, of course, which one would expect any
                    society to want to respect, but one has to be careful not to assume too
                    much.</p>

                <p>NOOTER: After 33 or 34 years I still find it an enormous challenge and a great
                    satisfaction to work in these programs at a high, medium or low level. At all
                    levels they can bring something positive to the countries where we work, and I
                    consider it a privilege to have been able to work in this way.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might just mention briefly what you've done since
                        you've left AID without going into detail so that they get a sense of what's

                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: I joined the World Bank in 1980 and my first assignment was in Tanzania
                    as the World Bank Resident Representative there. I happen to think that the
                    World Bank is an outstanding organization, but I guess Tanzania was probably one
                    of its worst programs anywhere in the world because the Bank was trying to
                    support a country with socialist policies that created enormous economic
                    disincentives. So it was an extremely frustrating situation in which, after a
                    year and a half, I told the Bank I thought there was no investment that the Bank
                    could make in Tanzania under the conditions existing at that time that would
                    assist in development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was Tanzania such a popular place? McNamara wanted to
                        do a lot, everybody else was excited about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOOTER: The Bank didn't realize what disincentives could be created in a
                    socialist economy. I certainly didn't until I lived in Tanzania and saw exactly
                    what effect it had. After all, the Soviet Union appeared to be successful, and
                    maybe with revolutionary zeal the system could be made to work for a while. But
                    it certainly didn't work in Tanzania. The Bank was trying to appear not to be
                    unwilling to accept another system, but now that's changed with the failure of
                    socialism in Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>In any event, that was my first assignment. Then I worked on programs in Sudan
                    from Washington for a number of years, and with other East African countries. I
                    retired from the Bank when I reached their mandatory retirement age in 1988, and
                    since then I've worked in a series of consultancies for the Bank in a whole
                    range of things having to do with the evaluation of structural adjustment
                    programs, the review of agricultural programs, writing agricultural strategies,
                    working on projects in highway maintenance, in mining and a whole range of other
                    assignments.</p>

                <p>NOOTER: Let me just say that I wish there were a magic wand that if you waved it,
                    then development would take place, but it's more complex than that. It's not
                    totally mysterious, of course, but it's like most of the social sciences. The
                    interrelationships are so complex that it's difficult to write simple formulae
                    that will show how to proceed. However, there are some things that we have
                    learned are more important than others. We have to concentrate on the important
                    issues to be sure the countries get those right, and then there are a lot of
                    other things that we can do that are useful if those important things are being
                    carried out correctly.</p>
