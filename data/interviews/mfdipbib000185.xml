                <p>AMBASSADOR FRANK CHARLES CARLUCCI III</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 1, 1997</p>

                <p>[Note: This is a continuation of an interview that began December 31,1996.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today, why don't we start off by concentrating on the
                        Africaexperience? I have you going to Johannesburg in about the end of
                        1957.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: That's correct, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had been in post management. Where had that been? I'm
                        justrying to figure out how you got yourself into Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: That was the Bureau of Near Eastern - what was then Near East African
                    Affairs. They were combined. I was slightly above a file clerk. The most
                    dramatic assignment I had in those days was to keep track of the dependents that
                    were being evacuated at the time of the Suez Crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be October 1956?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: That's right. Since that particular bureau encompassed Africa, when the
                    time came for assignments, they chose Africa for me-even though I spoke
                    Spanish.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you give me a little feel about what was the attitude towards Africa
                    then? This was just at the beginning of the discovery of Africa by the foreign
                    service but had it penetrated down to where you were? Was there a sense of
                    excitement or what was the feeling?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: There was a sense that Africa was becoming a major player on the world
                    political scene, that the cold war was extending its reach into Africa and we
                    needed to pay more attention to it. I was involved peripherally in helping to
                    organize the trip by then Vice President Nixon to Africa which underscored the
                    commitment of the administration to Africa. So it wasn't a full scale crisis.
                    They were mighty concerned about the pace of change in Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Q: Did you feel a sense of disappointment by going to Johannesburg which was sort
                    of one of the few old African posts and not Guyana or Nigeria or one of the
                    places that was beginning to...?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well I wasn't an African expert and I hoped to go to Latin America. But
                    I really wasn't disappointed in going to South Africa. I thought it was an
                    exciting place and a pretty place. I studied some of the history and became
                    interested in it. I became personally interested in the evolution of apartheid
                    and while I was a commercial officer in essentially an economic and consulate
                    post-Johannesburg - I undertook on my own initiative to go to a number of ANC
                    [African National Congress] meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now was this a legitimate group at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: They were allowed to meet. There was surveillance on me when I went to
                    the meetings. And after I had gone to a certain number of them, the South
                    African Government complained to our ambassador, Ambassador Byroade, at the time
                    about my activities. So although I wasn't doing anything illegal, they thought
                    it was suspect activity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation as you saw it in 1957 in South
                        Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I saw it, happily erroneously, as a looming clash between the black
                    population and the white population. When I left South Africa, I left with a
                    certain sense of despair because it was very difficult to see how their problems
                    could be worked out. I think the world owes a great word of thanks to the
                    leadership in South Africa for the way in which they have so far solved an
                    extraordinarily difficult problem.</p>
                <p>Q: Now I was in Africa in INR [Bureau of Intelligence and Research] in 1960 and
                    more or less I think our feeling was there was going to be a night of the long
                    knives at some point.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: That was my feeling.</p>
                <p>Q: I don't want to let Johannesburg go. Let's talk a bit about it. What were you
                    getting out of the ANC meetings? What was your impression of these?</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I got a sense of what their politics were, how militant they were.
                    Frankly, I felt they were less militant than they'd been described. I got to
                    know some of the splinter groups. I was the first person, for example, to talk
                    to Robert Sobukwe, who founded the Pan Africanist Congress. He later died. But I
                    got acquainted with the movement, which, interestingly, nobody in Pretoria had
                    been able to do. Our embassy was constrained from the attending the meetings.
                    The meetings were in Johannesburg. So I established a relationship, a personal
                    relationship, with some of the political officers in Pretoria and reported to
                    them. I wrote a number of political - what in those days were airgrams you may
                    recall-political airgrams on these meetings on the ANC. They were well received
                    in Washington and I think were basically responsible for my subsequent
                    assignment to the Congo as a political officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude towards your going out and
                        developing thesties? Let's start at the consul general level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The consul general, General Arthur Beach, didn't take a deep interest.
                    But he never blocked what I wrote and had no problem with me doing it as long as
                    I didn't get into any difficulty. The embassy at first, I think, was a bit
                    skeptical but then tended to encourage me as long as I had time for my basic
                    duties, my commercial duties, which I did. I remember I wrote the Basic Annual
                    Industries Report for South Africa which was favorably received by the
                    Department of Commerce.</p>
                <p>We had a very able local employee in Johannesburg named Gideon Uys, who was able
                    to contribute enormously. He and I worked together almost as equals on the
                    Annual Industry Report. The report received high marks from Washington.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, this is towards the end of Eisenhower administration and our own
                    segregation was coming under increasing attack and we'd had schools becoming
                    desegregated but certainly segregation was the rule of thumb in the American
                    south. Were you getting any reflections from this either from your bosses or
                    from the South Africans who were looking at what we were doing?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: No. The guidance that I had was that apartheid was wrong, we didn't
                    favor it. And we were certainly in those days much less activist in opposing
                    that kind of poor human rights policy. But it was clear that we did not favor
                    it. When I'd see lines that said Europeans only, I was frequently tempted to get
                    into the other line and say I was not a European. I certainly found the
                    segregation distasteful. And I must say I found a number of South Africans who
                    felt the same way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long had apartheid been sort of the rule there before
                        yoarrived in '57?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh, since right after World War II, following the JaSmuts
                    government.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Q: So it was well entrenched. Was there in Johannesburg the equivalent to an
                    opposition? I'm thinking of Suzman and other people like that.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh, yes. Helen Suzman was active. And you had the United Party in
                    opposition. While their rhetoric was a little bit more conciliatory toward the
                    blacks, they did not favor integration by any means. Helen Suzman was a lonely
                    voice. You had Alan Paton, who wrote Cry the Beloved Country, and a few other
                    people speaking out. But they were very much in the minority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we assigning black officers, or did we have any
                        blacofficers at that time to...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: When I was there, I don't recall any black officers. don't know what
                    the policy was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you went in 1960 it was to the Congo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This as a political officer. What was the situation in the
                        Congwhen you arrived there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I arrived 15 days before independence. We had a Consul General who was
                    leaving and an ambassador had been designated, Clare Timberlake. The situation
                    was one of considerable confusion. Nobody knew what was going to happen on the
                    day of independence. There was a lot of focus in the consulate general on
                    getting our independence delegation in place, making sure we were appropriately
                    represented. There was a feeling that we did not really know the real African
                    leadership. What was it going to be? Who was it going to be? What did the
                    Belgians let go of at the time of independence? There were just a lot of
                    unanswered questions. Some felt the Belgians had gone too fast. Everybody knew
                    that education-wise the Congolese were not fully prepared for Independence so
                    there was anticipation of difficulty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the beginning, were you involved in busy work or were
                        yoreally starting anew?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The most you could get was what you could dig out of the newspaper. The
                    bio files were inadequate to non-existent, to say the least. I set about to get
                    to know the political figures. I did several unorthodox things which irritated
                    the administrative officer of the embassy no end. I persuaded the DCM [deputy
                    chief of mission], Rob McIlvaine, a marvelous man, to allow me to rent a
                    Volkswagen so I had my own car and didn't go around in an embassy chauffeured
                    car. I then got myself some press credentials because the press moved around
                    more freely than anybody else could. Lumumba tended to hold a press conference a
                    day and I figured it was important to get into those. Then I got myself a pass
                    to the Parliament which was in formation. And basically spent all day outside
                    the embassy. Just floating in from time to time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How does one get to know the new Congo and how did you set
                        abouthat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I'd sit in the bar in the Parliament and go up and shake hands with
                    them and strike up a conversation. I got to know Patrice Lumumba under fairly
                    adverse circumstances which is getting ahead of the story a little bit. But
                    after independence when chaos broke loose-I might as well go into this story,
                    its an interesting story. It has to do with Ralph Bunch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. He was Under Secretary for Political Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: He came out just after independence. Prior to that, we had been through
                    the evacuation, the rapes and the pillaging. We were living in the embassy
                    around the clock. He dictated a cable calling on the UN [United Nations] to send
                    in a multinational force from my office. I was standing right beside him when he
                    dictated the cable. When the first planes came in bringing Ghanaian troops, we
                    had a critical situation. The ambassador called me up and said, “There is nobody
                    at the airport, the controllers have fled, the airplanes are in the air, they're
                    something like an hour from landing, get out there and get them down.” So I went
                    out to the airport and spent the day acting like [an air traffic] controller, an
                    airline attendant, and what have you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is for a naval, an ex-naval officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: That's, right. But we got the airplanes in. Meanwhilthe Belgian troops
                    had moved in to take over part of the airport.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of the day, Rob McIlvaine, the DCM, called me and said, “Patrice
                    Lumumba called and wants to go to Stanleyville and would we take him.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Frank, he's coming, he's on his way out.”</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>I guess that was early afternoon. Well, he didn't show up until about 5:00 and
                    just drove out onto the tarmac with a big entourage. On the other side, the
                    Belgian forces drove up and confronted him. I was standing in the middle between
                    the two forces with machine guns pointed at each other.</p>
                <p>Lumumba said, “I'm here to go to Stanleyville and you're going ttake me.”</p>
                <p>The aircraft commander came up and said, “We've just learned that the controllers
                    in Stanleyville have been killed and all the lights are out. We're not
                    going.”</p>
                <p>The Belgian colonel said, “Unless you get these people off the tarmain five
                    minutes, I'm opening fire.”</p>
                <p>So I had a dilemma on my hands. I finally grabbed the aircraft commander and I
                    said, “I don't care if we fly up to Stanleyville. Turn around and fly back.
                    We're getting in this airplane right now or there is going to be gunfire
                    here.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Okay.”</p>
                <p>So I took Lumumba and Kasavubu, both to Stanleyville.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain, at that point, who were these two?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Lumumba was prime minister and Kasavubu was president at that point.
                    And there was a man named Maurice Mpolo who was accompanying them as sort of a
                    military aide, who later became Minister of Sports. I told him that we had a
                    problem in Stanleyville, but if they insisted on going, I would take them. They
                    said we insist on going. In fact Lumumba had screamed at me. He called me and he
                    said something to the effect that “You Europeans are all hypocrites. You
                    promised me.”</p>
                <p>And when we got on the airplane, I said, “ Why did you scream at me?”</p>
                <p>He said, “I didn't realize you were an American. I thought you were European.”
                    The two of them stood in the cockpit. It was a Globemaster C-124. They stood in
                    the cockpit the entire flight to Stanleyville. On the way up, I told them that
                    there were Europeans in Stanleyville and I assumed they didn't have any
                    objection if we took them back on the plane. Lumumba agreed. Then when we got
                    off the plane, the Europeans came to me and said, “We want to leave but the
                    immigration authorities won't let us leave.”</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>I said, “Well, that's your problem. You go work it out with them. I'm not your
                    Consul.” These were basically Belgians. There were about 30 of them. They came
                    back a couple of hours later and said, “It's really hopeless. They won't let us
                    leave and they are now treating us in a way that our lives are in danger.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, I'm not your Consul but I'll see what I can do.”</p>
                <p>So I went around to the governor's house in Stanleyville where Lumumba and
                    Kasavubu were having a cocktail party and talked to Lumumba and said, “You had
                    in effect said I could take them out. We have done you a favor by bringing you
                    up here and I hoped that we could go ahead. You should let these people
                    loose.”</p>
                <p>And he responded with something like, “These are bad “Flemish” and they shouldn't
                    be allowed to go.” But then he turned to me - he was tall and I am short - and
                    dropped his hand on my shoulder and said, “But I like you. Your are my friend. I
                    give you the Belgians. It's a gift.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Don't give it as a gift, but I'm happy to take them.”</p>
                <p>For several years thereafter I got cards from the Belgians thanking me for
                    getting them out of Stanleyville. That's how I got to know Lumumba. We became
                    pretty good-I don't want to say friends-but every time I'd run across him, he'd
                    have a pleasant greeting for me.</p>
                <p>Q: Tell me, Frank, when you started this thing, when you arrived, this is
                    obviously Cold War time and all that, what were you getting when you arrived at
                    the embassy about sort of American interests in the Congo and the people who
                    seemed to be coming in - Lumumba, Kasavubu, and that?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well the Congo was the focus of world attention. It was at the heart of
                    the Cold War struggle at the time. There was a lot of feeling that Lumumba was a
                    Communist sympathizer. We had Senator Dodd, Tom Dodd, who was an active critic
                    of people like Lumumba and Gbenye, the latter being Lumumba's Interior Minister.
                    Dodd came out and I was his escort officer. I thought he had become convinced
                    that Lumumba and Gbenye, while they may have had some sympathy for the Soviets,
                    didn't really understand what communism was. But when he went back to the U.S.,
                    he called them communists again. We should remember that Lumumba came to
                    Washington and was rejected before he turned to the Soviets. How he got to
                    Washington was an interesting story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's hear it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: DCM, McIlvaine called me one day and said the prime minister had just
                    called him and he said that he wanted to go to Washington. McIlvaine had said,
                    “Fine, we will be glad to welcome you in Washington. Could you tell me when the
                    visit will take place?”</p>
                <p>The answer was “This afternoon.” McIlvaine instructed me, “Frank,you've got to
                    organize this.”</p>
                <p>I went to the consul, who was a rather strong-willed woman named Tally Palmer -
                    Allison - who later became famous for defense of women's rights in the State
                    Department. I said, “Tally, I want you to prepare about 20 visas on blank sheets
                    of paper.” She looked at me like I was crazy. I said, “Now, just do it.” Sure
                    enough, all of a sudden a delegation appeared on her doorstep and said, “We want
                    20 visas.” She was able to issue these visas on blank sheets of paper.</p>
                <p>I then went to the airport. I couldn't find an airplane. I couldn't figure out
                    how they were going to get to the U.S. So I went to the controller's office and
                    said, “Do you have an aircraft coming in that is going to take the prime
                    minister of the Congo to the United States?”</p>
                <p>He said, “No. The only thing we've got in is a Ghanaian Air Forcplane that just
                    landed and disembarked some troops.”</p>
                <p>So, I went back to the radio room and at that moment, Lumumba and his entourage
                    pulled up. I stopped them and said, “Mr. Prime Minister, we would like to
                    welcome you to the United States, but do you know how you are going to get
                    there?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Do you see that plane over there?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Yes. It's a Ghanaian Air Force plane.”</p>
                <p>He said, “We're going in that plane.”</p>
                <p>I went over to the plane and said to the pilot, “Did anybody give yoany
                    instructions to take a group of Congolese to the United States?”</p>
                <p>He said, “No.” And at that moment Lumumba and company approached thplane. The
                    pilot looked at me and he said, “What should I do?”</p>
                <p>I said, “You better salute and let him board and take them wherever they want to
                    go,” which is precisely what the pilot did. In fact, there was a humorous
                    sequence when he got out on the tarmac ready to take off. A straggler came
                    running out and stood in front of the airplane and wouldn't let them take off
                    until they put him on board. They lowered the ladder and put him on board. They
                    flew to Accra where apparently they got a plane to go to the United States.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to the time of the independence, when
                        independence happened. What were your experiences sort of on the day and
                        right afterward?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: On the day of independence I had heard rumors that rioting was
                    occurring at the Parliament building so I grabbed an Lingala-speaking driver and
                    went to the Parliament building where the troops were indeed rioting. I went up
                    to them and through the driver asked what they were rioting about. The answer
                    was interesting. They were upset not so much at the Belgians as at their own
                    leadership, Patrice Lumumba and others, who had suddenly sprouted big cars, big
                    houses, and flashy suits. They said General Janssens, who had been made
                    commander of the Force Publique, had written on the blackboard independence
                    equals no change for the military. They asked, “What's in it for us? Everybody
                    else gets something and we get nothing.” Subsequently, Lumumba who was an
                    absolute spellbinder, a very charismatic man...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he from the Leopoldville area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: He was from Stanleyville. He didn't have a tribal base in Leopoldville.
                    He didn't have a strong tribal base anywhere, in fact. He'd been a postal clerk
                    in Stanleyville. I think he'd actually been arrested for embezzlement or
                    something similar during the colonial period. He went out to the military camp
                    at Djelo Binza and talked to the soldiers. He managed to turn them against the
                    Belgians. That's when anti-Belgian rioting started. I went out, I think it was
                    either that day or the next day to the neighborhood where I was living which was
                    past the military camp. We assembled the Americans and I led a convoy of
                    Americans into the embassy. We were stopped a number of times by soldiers. In
                    fact, my then two year old daughter had a bayonet poked right in her face. But
                    we made it to the embassy. People essentially lived in the embassy until they
                    were evacuated. We evacuated as many as we could by ferry but then the
                    ferry...</p>
                <p>Q: Was the ferry over to Brazzaville.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Brazzaville, yes. Then the ferries were shut off. On occasion soldiers
                    would come up and point guns at the embassy. I remember going out and
                    confronting one. He was pointing his gun at the embassy. I told him that he had
                    a duty not to attack the embassy but to help me go over and rescue some
                    Americans who were in a hotel. To my surprise he agreed and we went over and got
                    some Americans out of the hotel. But we lived in the embassy for a couple of
                    days. Timberlake did a marvelous job as ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was he doing at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: He was sending cables and giving instructions. It was he who told me to
                    get out and get the planes landed. He began to feel that the Lumumba regime was
                    increasingly erratic and very difficult to deal with. He was pushing for the UN
                    troops to come in quickly as the only means of saving the situation.
                    Peacekeeping has a somewhat mixed reputation these days but the Congo has to be
                    characterized as a very successful multinational peacekeeping operation. The
                    troops who came in - the Ghanaians, the Moroccans, the Nigerians, Ethiopians,
                    subsequently Indians, Pakistanis - all did a marvelous job. Basically, they
                    restored order after a period of time. The panic with which the Belgians fled
                    was amazing. I went around my neighborhood and remember a houseboy coming out
                    and telling me his employer had said, “Take everything; it's all yours.”</p>
                <p>Another said, “They left the phonograph playing. Should I turn it off?” People
                    fled literally in their nightgowns. The neighborhoods were deserted for quite
                    some time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was the decision made to get the families out? Was
                        thiright after independence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: When the rioting broke out. It became very clear that it was an
                    extremely dangerous situation. I think the rioting broke out around the early
                    part of July, about a month after independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to get any fix on where Lumumba and Kasavubu
                        weror what they were trying to do at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh yes, we had some contact with them. Lumumba wasn't hard to get a fix
                    on because he had a press conference practically every day. By talking to his
                    aides and by attending the press conferences, we could keep track of Lumumba. It
                    wasn't very good news. Kasavubu kept pretty much to himself in his presidential
                    residence, but Timberlake would call on him. He took me along as the
                    interpreter. We called on him several times. Lumumba, of course, at one point
                    called on the Russians to come into the Congo which made big headlines. That's
                    another interesting story. I attended that press conference. At the end of the
                    press conference, I was rushing back to the embassy to file my cable and three
                    reporters, Welles Hangen, who later was missing in Cambodia, Henry Tanner of the
                    New York Times and Arnaud De Borchgrave, who was then with Newsweek, said,
                    “Frank, it's more important that the U.S. government get this message straight
                    than it is that we file our dispatches early. So we're going to come back and
                    help you write your cable.” Very unusual. They came back and helped me write the
                    cable and then went off and filed their despatches. Bob McIlvaine who was a
                    stickler for good drafting took a look at my cable and puffed on his pipe and
                    said, “Well I guess it can go by cable and not by airgram. But get it down to
                    one and a half pages, Frank.”</p>
                <p>I said, “But my God, he's called on the Russians to come in!”</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>He said, “Go do it right.”</p>
                <p>I learned a lesson and I went back and redrafted it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the analysis of why he called the Russians
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I think he had become frustrated with the west. He had gone to
                    Washington and asked us for military help. He realized, correctly it turned out-
                    we didn't agree at the time-that the Katanga secession could only be put down by
                    force.</p>
                <p>He wanted military assistance to do that. He went to Washington and did not get
                    the kind of assistance that he sought. He went to Moscow and they responded by
                    sending him some trucks-something like 100 Russian trucks came into Congo. As
                    history can now document, in the end we had to agree to allow the UN forces to
                    go in to Katanga and put an end to the secession. I ended up in the front wave
                    of the troops that did that.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we come to that, what were we saying as far as American participation
                    or doing something when we'd helped Lumumba go to the United States? What was
                    the embassy recommendation on his sudden coming there and how to treat him and
                    how did it work out from your perspective?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, there wasn't much time to make any recommendation other than he's
                    coming to the United States and wants our support. Treat him hospitably and be
                    as responsive as you can. The embassy, as I recall, it was a long time ago, but
                    I don't think we were arguing in favor of giving military support to Lumumba. We
                    thought that preserving the integrity of the Congo was important and we were
                    sympathetic on that goal. But it was the means to accomplish the goal that we
                    could not support.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the attitude toward the province at that time as far as American
                    interest and the recent secession movement? How did we feel about that?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: At that time, those were the early days, the days of Patrice Lumumba,
                    there was very little sentiment in the United States for a separate Katanga.
                    That changed, over the course of the next year and a half as Tshombe's very
                    successful lobbying machine got into operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we know any of the leaders in Chatting? I mean, did we
                        havmuch of a fix on Chatting?</hi>
                </p>

                <p>CARLUCCI: We did indeed. We had a consul down there named Bill Canup, who know
                    Tshombe as a provincial governor. I had met Tshombe during the independence
                    ceremonies. And we knew Monongo, the Interior Minister who allegedly was present
                    when Lumumba was killed.</p>
                <p>Q: When you arrived in Leopoldville and started there as a political officer,
                    what was your impression of the CIA station there and it's duty? I mean all this
                    is brand new and I was wondering-later this became a very important thing-but
                    what was your impression when you first arrived?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: When I first arrived I didn't have much contact with the station. The
                    consulate general had virtually no outside contacts. I remember being startled
                    when the consulate general said to me, “You need to find out what's going on
                    here,” go down and mix with the U.S. press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wait a minute, we're talking about Consulate General, this
                        ibefore it became an embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Before it became an embassy.</p>
                <p>I thought to myself, that's a strange way to function to mix with the U.S. press
                    and I proceeded to do my own thing. We weren't getting much information out of
                    the CIA. They didn't have a lot of contacts either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the meeting-the press going in there-this was
                        sort of a precursor to Vietnam. I mean this is where all the...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: We were swamped with press people. I think the quality was quite high.
                    Some of them went into danger. There was one who was killed in the Kasai. He was
                    a very bright and able young man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find there was a close relationship between the
                        embassreporting staff and the press corps at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Since I was the principal writer in the embassy, there wasn't a day
                    that the press wasn't in my office. Those were the days when it wasn't a sin for
                    the press to talk to government officials and vice versa. Those were also the
                    days when I could say to the press, “This is confidential,” and know that they
                    would respect the confidentiality. They would also share information with me. So
                    we did have a good relationship, plus the fact that I saw them all the time at
                    Lumumba's press conferences.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Q: What about as these trucks arrived? What were we seeing by that time? Had
                    Lumumba with his 100 trucks, Soviet trucks, I mean had this become a cause for
                    us or...?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes. This had been blown up out of proportion to its intrinsic worth.
                    We were all worried about the Russian technicians who had come along with the
                    trucks and what they would do. It was a symbol that Lumumba was willing to, if
                    necessary, play the Soviet game and that aroused a great deal of concern.
                    Lumumba moved further and further to the left. You could argue that he was
                    driven there by the west's lack of responsiveness. Whether it was that or
                    whether it was his inclination, or whether he was enticed by what the Soviets
                    had to offer, those were all fears. The fact was that he gradually became more
                    critical in his comments toward the west and more erratic in his behavior. I
                    came to fear that he had lost not only our confidence but he was losing the
                    confidence of his own parliament. A lot of people thought I was nuts when I said
                    that. One of the riskier things that I've done in my entire career was to do a
                    nose count of the Congolese parliament in 1960. But I listed each member and
                    where I thought he was going to vote anI concluded that Lumumba would lose.
                    Washington couldn't believe that but we managed to persuade Washington that the
                    UN should be allowed to hold what was called the Lovanium summit where the
                    parliament was sequestered. It was kept insulated from political pressures and
                    beer until they voted. Lumumba was defeated. It was out of that meeting that
                    Adoula became Prime Minister, a much more moderate man. It's common to say that
                    Lumumba was - there was a coup against Lumumba - but in fact he was voted out.
                    It was then that he, as I recall the sequence, that he reacted.</p>
                <p>He went into his residence and it was only when he left his residence to try and
                    flee that he was captured. Had he stayed in his residence, he probably wouldn't
                    have been captured. As it was, I was probably - I and then Senator Gale McGee -
                    were probably the last two westerners to see him alive. We were having a drink
                    about mid-afternoon at a sidewalk caf� and a truck went by. Lumumba had his
                    hands tied behind his back and was in the rear part of the truck. The truck was
                    on the way to the airport. As you know, he was killed either in the airplane or
                    shortly after he got off the airplane in the Katanga.</p>
                <p>Q: At that time, did we see the... Were the Soviets or the Soviet embassy, was it
                    a real competition? I mean did you find yourself jostling the Soviet political
                    officers or not?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: No. I can't recall the Soviet embassy being that active. But I have to
                    say I was not dealing with the diplomatic community. I was essentially the
                    embassy's outrider and I was dealing with the Congolese. But the diplomatic
                    relationships with the embassies were being handled at level higher than
                    mine.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned when Lumumba was using these 100 trucks, you got involved with
                    those?</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>BARLUCCI: I didn't get involved. I was at the press conference when he called on
                    the Soviets to come in. The trucks were sent and that caused quite a fuss, quite
                    a stir in the western press. It was the beginning of the slippery slope that
                    Lumumba got on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Adoula came in, what was the feeling towards
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: We'd known Adoula, we liked him, there was a warm feeling, a feeling
                    that we wanted to make his government a success. He was invited to Washington.
                    By then I had gone back to Washington. I was his escort officer when he was in
                    Washington. It was a whole new atmosphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kasavubu, where did we see him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, we saw Kasavubu as a moderate figure, but he was very slow to
                    action. We made efforts to persuade him that he had to move and I guess
                    eventually, certainly when the Congress and the Parliament voted, he dismissed
                    Lumumba. But there was no love lost between Kasavubu and Lumumba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With this group, I think wasn't there an instance where
                        you goknifed or something like that happened to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes. That was during a visit of, I believe it was LoHenderson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Under Secretary for Political Affairs or something

                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I think he was Deputy Secretary. Anyway, he came out. We were heading
                    back to the airport. I was in a separate car. I wasn't part of the entourage. I
                    was in a car that was being driven by the chief warrant officer of the Defense
                    attach�'s office. We had in the car Lieutenant Colonel Dannemiller, who was the
                    Army attach�, and his wife. I was sitting in the front seat. The car was going
                    too fast. I can remember telling the warrant officer that I thought he was going
                    too fast. A bicyclist was crossing the road - one of these things where neither
                    could guess which way the other was going and eventually we hit him and plowed
                    into a ditch. I could see right away that he was dead. I knew what was going to
                    happen. I told the warrant officer to run and get out of there quickly which he
                    did. The wife of our Army attach� was in a state of shock. We couldn't get her
                    out of the car, so I did the only thing that could be done at that point. I went
                    over to the body to draw the crowd away from the car. I was successful. He
                    eventually got her out of the car and they got away. But in the meantime, of
                    course, the crowd surrounded me. Several people stopped and tried to help. Tally
                    Palmer stopped. She had a silver convertible. I'll never forget it. I told her,
                    “Get out of here,” because she couldn't get close to me.</p>
                <p>Then the crowd started beating me up. I felt what I thought was a hard blow to my
                    back, and about that time - actually somebody else, I think Larry Detlan stopped
                    as well - and shouted at me and said, “Some people will take you into the
                    village.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Larry, the last place I want to go is into the village.”</p>
                <p>It was getting fairly serious when a Congolese bus driver drove his bus right
                    through the crowd and opened his door right at my back and I just stepped into
                    the bus. I didn't know I had been stabbed until I saw the pool of blood on the
                    floor of the bus. He, in essence, saved my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was an extremely dangerous time, wasn't it there, at
                        thapoint?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, yes. Subsequently there had been a lot of dangerous posts in the
                    foreign service, but that was one of the earlier ones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Allison Palmer? What was your impression,
                        because she became a figure in her own right particularly on women's affairs
                        and this? How did she operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: She was a consulate officer in the embassy. I think she showed courage,
                    certainly by stopping and trying to help me at the time. I didn't have a lot of
                    interaction with her. We had a cordial relationship. She didn't really comment
                    on political affairs. She didn't spent much time outside the embassy. She just
                    basically did visa and passport work. Certainly she might have held strong
                    views, we didn't hear those views at the time. At least I didn't.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Q: The Kennedy administration came on in January 1961 and did you see a change in
                    the embassy policy and all because the Kennedy administration came and Soapy
                    Williams was the assistant secretary for African Affairs? You know there was a
                    lot of emphasis on Africa.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The major change was there had been a history of bad feelings between
                    Chester Bowles and Clare Timberlake. I can remember Timberlake telling me when
                    Chester Bowles was named Under Secretary of State that his days on the job were
                    probably numbered, because he and Bowles had clashed in India. In fact, that
                    turned out to be the case. Timberlake became increasingly critical of the UN
                    operation, Rajeshwar Dayal in particular.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: He was the Indian who headed the UN operation. Not a particularly good
                    choice, if I may say so. He was a very bright man, but he had a somewhat
                    supercilious attitude toward the Africans-tended to look down on them. They
                    didn't like him. In fact, it is fair to say they despised him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say Africans, does this also mean the troops of
                        Guyanand from other African...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: No, no. The Congolese. They tended to view him as a new form of
                    colonialism. This was post-Lumumba, but certainly Adoula had problems with
                    Dayal. Mobutu, the military, all had problems with him. Timberlake came to feel
                    that the UN was not being supportive enough of the central government efforts to
                    deal with Katanga's secession as well. Timberlake was called back for
                    consultation and never returned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was after the Kennedy administration came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes, after the Kennedy administration. He was called back for
                    consultation and never returned. At the same time, Dayal was called back for
                    consultation and never returned. So there was an obvious swap. It looks like
                    that's what happened. A man named Sture Linner took over, a Swede, who was much
                    more effective. He gradually gained the confidence of the Congolese. It cost us
                    a very able ambassador, not that we didn't have a good replacement. Mac Godley
                    came as charg� and did a superb job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Mac Godley operate? Was there a difference between
                        hohe operated and maybe his outlook than Clare Timberlake?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Clare Timberlake was kind of a street fighter. Godley was a very
                    courageous individual, but he had a more sophisticated approach. Timberlake was
                    very blunt. Once when Washington told him to do something, he shot back, “I'll
                    go ahead and do it, but trying to do that out here is like trying to stuff a raw
                    oyster in a slot machine.” I can remember staying up with Godley all night while
                    we were arguing with Dean Rusk about the Lovanium Conference. At one point the
                    State Department felt that Lumumba was going to win at Lovanium and they wanted
                    to call the whole thing off after it had been started. We went out to a secure
                    telephone in a trailer in a remote area and spent all night arguing with
                    Washington. Our channel was through Sheldon Vance, the office director, but Dean
                    Rusk was the real problem. Godley stood up to the State Department and convinced
                    them that the Lovanium Conference ought to continue. And it had, as I mentioned
                    earlier, it had a successful outcome. We turned out to be right, thank God.</p>
                <p>Q: How about Mobutu? We're talking today on April 1, 1997, and Mobutu is
                    seemingly on the ropes in Zaire now, but he's been around since that time. Did
                    you run across Mobutu and have any dealings with him?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I knew him because of my habit of mixing with the Congolese down at the
                    parliament. He'd show up at the parliament and I got to know him while he was
                    still a Sergeant, before he became commander of the troops. I can remember one
                    episode after he became commander of the troops. I wanted to get into the
                    parliament and I had already missed their passes. The guard at the door wouldn't
                    let me in and actually pushed his bayonet against my stomach. The picture was in
                    the New York Times the next day. I was very irritated. I went over and I found
                    Mobutu having a beer at the bar. I said to him, “Look, here are all my
                    credentials, don't you think I should be allowed to get into the
                    parliament?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Yes.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well will you please see that I'm allowed in?”</p>
                <p>He said, “I can't do that.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Why not?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Because I'm not in charge here.”I said, “Well you're commander in chief
                    of the Army and if you're not in charge here, who is?”</p>
                <p>And he pointed to the guy who had just jammed the bayonet in mstomach and said,
                    “He is.”</p>
                <p>We developed a relationship. I don't want to say it was close, but we certainly
                    knew each other. I think Larry Devlin and I went to see him shortly after he
                    took over. I walked out of there saying, “Larry, this guy can't last 10 days!”
                    Shows you how good a political leader analyst I was.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reaction of the embassy on the report of
                        knowledgof Lumumba's murder?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, we were of course distressed, but what we tried to do was report
                    the facts as we had them. There wasn't a lot to be obtained in Leopoldville.
                    Most of the action had taken place in the Katanga and we had to depend on our
                    consul in Elizabethville to report in on what had transpired there. Our best
                    assessment was that he had been killed after he arrived in the Katanga. A UN
                    report subsequently said this, probably in the presence of Monongo.</p>
                <p>Q: Did this cause a change? Was there at that time any concern that maybe this
                    was part of the United Nations' effort to rid ourselves of this gentleman?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: We had other things on our mind. When this happened, as I recall, I was
                    in Stanleyville. This was shortly after they had arrested all the Europeans in
                    Stanleyville and thrown them out. Timberlake asked me if I'd go up there, back
                    and forth and act as consul for Stanleyville. They announced on Stanleyville
                    radio that Lumumba had been murdered and that I was the man who had done it.
                    They claimed I was a paratroop captain or colonel, I guess. I had made it up to
                    the rank of colonel. They were going to see that justice was done. And as I
                    recall, Kwame Nkrumah sent a cable to Dag Hammarskjold about me killing Lumumba
                    and a few other things like that. So we had to worry a little bit about
                    survival. I had to find my way out of Stanleyville. I did that by hitchhiking.
                    In fact, I hitchhiked in a UN plane to Bukavu and then to Elizabethville and
                    then back to Leopoldville. I went back up to Stanleyville a couple of weeks
                    later and they arrested me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, they put me under house arrest. They declared mpersona non
                    grata.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the Congolese government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It was a breakaway government in Stanleyville, headed by Antoine
                    Gizenga. Kabula was a member of that government. I didn't know him well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's now the rebel leader looking like he might take
                        over.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: We had Gizenga, Gbenye, Weregemere, and a number of other Lumumba
                    supporters in Stanleyville. They had broken away when - I guess after Lovanium -
                    I can't recall the exact sequence, certainly when Mobutu had taken over. They
                    declared their own government. I'd been going back and forth, meeting with them,
                    when they declared me persona non grata. About then, I wanted to introduce my
                    successor, Tom Cassilly (who later got arrested himself), so I said I'd go up
                    one more time. I flew up and at the airport, they arrested me and they said I
                    should get back on the airplane and go back to Leopoldville.</p>
                <p>I said, “I had no intention of doing that. I was staying iStanleyville.”</p>
                <p>By that time the airplane had left and the next airplane was four or five days
                    away. So they said, “Well we're going to put you under house arrest.”</p>
                <p>So they put me in a house with a guard out in front. The guard had a machine gun.
                    I managed to step out once or twice anyway. The day I was due to leave, the
                    acting foreign minister, a man named Arsen Dionge, acting foreign minister of
                    the Gizenga breakaway government, came around. He was trying to be very
                    diplomatic. He came in and he said, “How is everything?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Not very well.”</p>
                <p>He said, “What's your problem?”</p>
                <p>I said, “I certainly don't like being under house arrest and I don'like being
                    declared persona non grata.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Oh, well, that. That, you shouldn't worry about it. It's just that it's
                    not convenient to have you around right now. It's really not persona non grata
                    or anything like that.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well the next thing you are going to tell me is that I'm nounder house
                    arrest.”</p>
                <p>He said, “No, you're not under house arrest, no problem.”</p>
                <p>With that, the guard, who had apparently lost his patience, came in and pointed
                    his machine gun at the acting Foreign Minister and starting talking in a local
                    dialect. And Dionge turned to me and said, “Well, could you tell him who you are
                    and who I am and that I'm the acting Foreign Minister because he doesn't seem to
                    understand.”</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Well, it was a little hard to contain my laughter. So I tried to explain to the
                    guard that it's okay because he was the foreign minister and the foreign
                    minister is a big man around here. Finally, the guard decided it was okay, and
                    he put down his gun and walked back to his post. With that, the acting foreign
                    minister turned to me and said, “This place is terrible. Can you sell me any
                    dollars?”</p>
                <p>They then took me and put me on an airplane and that was my last timin
                    Stanleyville.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the people in our consulate general doing
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh, they had closed that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It had been closed by that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh, yes. You see what happened, shortly, I guess about three or four
                    months into Independence, they rounded up all Europeans and made them stand in
                    the sun all day long. They chased out our consul and there was nobody up there.
                    Timberlake called me. I'll never forget, he called me on the phone and said,
                    “Frank, I hate to have to ask you to do this but somebody's got to protect the
                    American citizens in Stanleyville. Are you willing to go up there?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Okay.”</p>
                <p>I must say the first airplane ride up there was pretty lonely. I was the only
                    person on the airplane. Nobody was going near Stanleyville. I was able to, I
                    think, restore some sense of confidence to the Americans and able to deal a
                    little bit with the breakaway government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say, who were the Americans and how did

                <p>CARLUCCI: I tried to get them to leave. I can remember urging them to leave. They
                    were very fatalistic. They didn't want to leave. And you may recall that about a
                    year later Belgian paratroops had to go in and rescue them and some were
                    killed.</p>

                <p>CARLUCCI: He was much later.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you are dealing with the Congolese at that time, either
                        in Parliament or at these breakaway assemblies, what was your impression of
                        how the government was operating?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The Congolese government?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It was chaotic. There was no government. There were ministers and
                    soldiers who had big cars and big houses. All your conversations with them were
                    political. Nobody was interested in restoring the country's economy or dealing
                    with payment problems, inflation, or anything like that. Adoula's government
                    took it a little more seriously. There was a man named Albert Adele who was
                    governor of the central bank. He was one of the Congo's only three or four
                    Ph.D.s, and he was very bright. He tended to take it seriously. There were
                    others. There was an opposition politician who I gave a leader grant to, Kamitas
                    Kamitata, who was governor of the province that included Leopoldville. He, I
                    thought, was responsible. There were elements of leadership, but the chaos
                    almost overwhelmed everyone.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Q: Now, I was in African INR about this time, and although I had the heart of
                    Africa, we'd look at the airgrams and all, there was a feeling that it reminded
                    me at that time of caricatures, hostile caricatures, of what happened in the
                    South during the early Reconstruction period when the freed slaves were taking
                    over. This is a caricature that has gone on but the reports seem to almost
                    define that.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It was pretty chaotic. I was in a hotel room one time in Stanleyville
                    when a farce took place. A minister of the breakaway government and I were
                    talking. He had his girlfriend in the hotel room and a man came pounding on the
                    door shouting it was his wife. The man was hauled away in a jeep. It was
                    chaotic.</p>
                <p>Q: Were we pretty much, except for trying to protect ourselves and all, were we
                    trying to do the equivalent of later what would become nationbuilding?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes. When I got back to Washington, I found there were three of us
                    working on the desk: Bill Harrop, Charlie Whitehouse, and myself. I concerned
                    myself with internal politics, and Charlie worked on nationbuilding. Basically
                    the first task was to get the rabble called the Congolese Army under control. Of
                    course, 35 years later, it's still not under control. There is no discipline in
                    it. There was no discipline then. It was a pure rabble then. It is a pure rabble
                    now. We tried. Now, of course, we are being criticized for trying because that
                    was characterized as military aid to Mobutu. So you're damned if you do and
                    damned if you don't.</p>
                <p>Q: By the way, while you were in the Congo, you were talking about being used as
                    the point man and going out and I mean this is not a comfortable period. In
                    fact, your exploits there became legendary within the Foreign Service. I heard
                    about these. The aura lingers on.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The embassy administrative officer called me accident prone because I
                    kept smashing up his Volkswagen. It was a rented car. It was exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, what about the other side of this? What about
                        youfamily?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: They were evacuated. They were sent to Ghana. They later came back. You
                    had personal inconvenience. Our house was robbed several times. I caught a
                    burglar cutting through the screen with a machete three feet from my baby
                    daughter's crib. We had a lot of personal inconvenience. We were all young and
                    lived with that.</p>
                <p>Q: We'll finish up on the Congo side as the desk officer. With the three of you
                    working on that, did you sense a different attitude when you got back to
                    Washington? Did they have a sense of the reality of the Congo?</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: No, Washington was torn. There was an acknowledgment that probably it
                    was desirable to keep the Congo together but there was a lot of sympathy for
                    Katanga's secession. Tom Dodd lobbied...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the democratic senator from Connecticut.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: ...lobbied the Kennedy administration incessantly. State Department
                    wobbled all over. Basically the bureau of International Affairs (IO) was
                    sympathetic to us in the African bureau. The European bureau tended to
                    sympathize with the Katanga secessionists, and George McGee, who was Under
                    Secretary of State, frankly would vacillate on the issue. We turned out to be
                    very hard chargers. We had people like Bill Harrop and Charlie Whitehouse who
                    were very able. Mac Godley became officer in charge succeeding Sheldon Vance, a
                    very headstrong individual. A very strong team. Wayne Fredericks, who was Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary was good. The governor, Governor Williams, bless his
                    heart...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Soapy Williams?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Soapy Williams. His heart was always in the right place, but he was no
                    match for the bureaucrats. He'd get outmaneuvered practically all the time. We
                    tended to ram things through. So much so that we finally ended the Katanga
                    secession by giving the green light to the UN to move in. George Ball said no
                    two of us should ever be allowed to serve together again.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought that this whole thing would have particularly attracted
                    somebody like Robert Kennedy and some of the activists around President Kennedy?
                    You were young and you were hard charging. Africa was sort of the Kennedy
                    playground...?</p>
                <p>BARLUCCI: Dean Rusk did not take a deep interest. George Ball did from time to
                    time. He generally came out right. Whenever we got into real trouble, we would
                    use Ed Gullion, who was then the ambassador. Kennedy liked Ed Gullion. He'd met
                    him in Vietnam or someplace and liked him personally. Gullion was a marvelous
                    man, very bright, very articulate. So when we felt ourselves sliding down the
                    slope, we'd call Gullion back for consultation and have him go over and see the
                    President. And that always worked. Kennedy's instincts were quite good. He was
                    perfectly willing to take on Tom Dodd. Some of the people in the State
                    Department were less willing to take oDodd.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom Dodd was not just alone. In a way didn't he represent,
                        yomight call, the European centric but also...</hi>

                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: To some extent. But he didn't have a lot of support in the Congress.
                    The Chairman of the African subcommittee at the time was Al Gore, Al Gore,
                    Senior. I can remember endless hearings which I used to go up and support Soapy
                    Williams. Gore was not sympathetic to Tom Dodd's point of view. In the house, we
                    had Barry O'Hara as chairman of the House Committee and he understood our story.
                    Fred Dutton was the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations and he used
                    to take me up there for endless briefings. We really blanketed the Congress and
                    fairly well isolated Dodd. And as you know he was later censured by the Senate,
                    not for the Congo activity but for some other activity.</p>
                <p>Q: I think it's an interesting thing, and I'd like to get this, to see how able
                    people have really essentially rather quite subordinate roles in the thing, can
                    be quite important within a policy consideration that is not attracting the very
                    top echelon.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, I guess the answer to that is in those days you could. I don't
                    know if you could today. You've had people resign over Bosnia. They were
                    subordinate people. Marshall Freeman and people like that. It's true that today
                    there are dissent channels and people taking a different point of view is more
                    common I suppose. We put our careers on the line, there's no question. I can
                    remember one point when Mac Godley was ambassador I was in a meeting with Dean
                    Rusk, who in frustration said, “Does our ambassador over there understand what
                    our policy is?”</p>
                <p>Q: I thought sort of the one constant in our African policy which hangs on today
                    is that once you start allowing these breakaway provinces and all, because of
                    the tribal intermix, absolute chaos will be and maybe there are lousy borders,
                    but there are borders and we better stick to those.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: You're citing almost verbatim the standard paper that I used to write
                    and rewrite. I'd just switch the paragraphs around saying just about that. Once
                    you start down this slope, it's very slippery. I think there is something like
                    36-or I can't remember how many-52 different tribes in the Congo. They'd all be
                    seeking their independence. Africa would fragment. The only solution is to
                    respect the colonial boundaries. INR, I might say, at a critical point and time
                    was very helpful. Ed Streator wrote a paper very well done on precisely that
                    issue and said that unless we act decisively, things are going to collapse; it's
                    all going to fall apart. That was shortly after the Kennedy administration's
                    successful prosecution of the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This had been in what October of '62?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Something like that. They were feeling confident about their ability to
                    handle foreign affairs. They were flexing their muscles. They were becoming more
                    assertive. They were becoming more cohesive. So that when we finally said, “Hey,
                    look, the balloon is about to go up on the Katanga. You can't vacillate any
                    more.” They were willing to make the hard decision. The Pentagon was the first
                    to come in and say-there was a Colonel in our meeting who said, “I think you've
                    got to support a military solution here. There's no other way.” Then the tide
                    began to turn and we were able to turn a blind eye to the UN because the UN
                    wanted to do what was quite clear was the only solution and we were holding them
                    back. We were able to send a signal that said something to the effect don't over
                    restrain yourselves.</p>
                <p>Q: When I get you again, we'll go into Zanzibar. Also, I'd like to have you
                    expand a bit more on the incident in, I think it was, Stanleyville, where you
                    were with a Minister who was with his lady friend. If you could give me more
                    detail on that. I think it's highly amusing and indicative of the situation. You
                    also mentioned off mic how your telegrams and cable and dispatches were received
                    in Washington and the sage advice given to you about humor in the foreign
                    service. A final question. Did you notice any change when Kennedy was
                    assassinated and the Johnson administration took over in the attitude toward the
                    Congo at that point. Was there any change in emphasis or interest?</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 30th of June, 1997. Frank, could you go into a little more detail
                    about that time in Stanleyville. Do you recall the incident with the young
                    lady?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You more or less eluded to it last time and I think it

                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I had struck up an acquaintance with a man who was a Minister of Mines
                    in Lumumba's government, named Weregemere. He joined the Gizenga breakaway
                    government. As I mentioned earlier, I went back and forth up there until they
                    finally kicked me out. On one occasion, he asked me to come around to his hotel
                    room. I think it was his hotel room because he wanted to talk to me. The purpose
                    of the meeting was to warn me that the Gizenga people were out to get me. When I
                    entered the hotel room, he had a young lady there, a rather attractive young
                    lady. As we were discussing weighty matters-the UN presence and the Gizenga
                    government-she apparently got tired, went over to the bed, took her clothes off
                    and just laid down on the bed. We continued talking and drinking our beer. All
                    of a sudden, there was a pounding on the door. Weregemere went to the door - and
                    I could hear some scuffling and a man shouting, “I want my wife! I want my
                    wife!” With that, the young lady went to the bathroom. I didn't know what to do,
                    so I sort of followed her into the bathroom. The scuffling continued and
                    eventually whoever was pounding on the door was taken by soldiers and dumped
                    into a jeep and driven off someplace. Weregemere came back in and we resumed our
                    conversation.</p>
                <p>Q: I remember this vividly because there was an African INR at the time and when
                    this came in, I think it was a despatch describing this thing. It, of course,
                    made the rounds to everywhere. It certainly made vivid the situation there, but
                    could you talk a bit about the fact that you were sending in these rather
                    detailed pictures of the area?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, it was hard not to laugh. In fact, humor was the only way you
                    kept your sanity in a place like Stanleyville unless you wanted to turn to
                    liquor, which a lot of people did. I can remember being in the presence of the
                    president of Stanleyville, a man named Jean Foster Manzikala, and hearing him
                    answering the phone by saying, “Yes, yes, Excellency.” “Well, which Excellency
                    are you?” They all called each other “Excellency.”</p>
                <p>Fist fights in the hotel were an every day event and I think sent in a dispatch
                    about those one time. Of course, there was a humorous event, which I think I
                    described for you, with the acting Foreign Minister Dionge.</p>
                <p>It was kind of fun sending those things in. I don't know how they were received.
                    It was later when I went to Zanzibar and I continued to do the same thing. Wayne
                    Fredericks one time told me, time, he was the Deputy Assistant Secretary for
                    African Affairs, he said, “Frank, you're cables make the best reading in the
                    African bureau. Keep it up and you'll never get promoted.” There were more than
                    a few people who thought I was a bit frivolous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went from the Congo, were you assigned directly to

                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: No. I came back and I was in effect Congo desk officer during the
                    Katanga secession. Then I had a brief tour in Personnel. When Zanzibar broke -
                    that is to say, when they expelled our consul and closed our consulate - and a
                    few months later, I was asked to go out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Zanzibar. You were there from when to

                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I arrived 1964 and I was there just about a year. So it would have been
                    probably-I think I would have gone out in early '64 and I think I was expelled
                    in January 1965.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had been the situation in Zanzibar that led to the
                        previouexpulsion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Zanzibar had become independent in 1964. We had a consul, Fritz Picard
                    was his name, who has since died. The Africans rose up and slaughtered the Arabs
                    because the Arabs had been running the place. They drove a number of them right
                    into the sea. They took over but they had a decided communist tinge. A lot of
                    the Africans had been trained at the Patrice Lumumba University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is in Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Moscow. Now there were a couple of Arabs involved with them. Babu and
                    Ali Sultan Issa, who had been trained in Moscow and Beijing respectively. By the
                    way, they have since both become capitalists. At the time, I remember shortly
                    after I got there, the hospital was named the V.I. Lenin hospital and the
                    stadium became the Mao Tse-tung stadium. All land was nationalized. In effect,
                    all the Westerners were kicked out. There was a good deal of hostility toward
                    the Americans and our consulate was shut down. Fritz Picard was marched out of
                    the country, I think, literally at gun point. A long, intensive effort began to
                    reopen our consulate, then turned embassy. A number of us in the State
                    Department favored reopening the embassy as soon as possible. The upper levels
                    of the State Department wanted us to play a secondary role to the British. The
                    British were more cautious. They didn't want us to open and their embassy had
                    been closed down, too. It was quite a long negotiation getting back in. Actually
                    I went to Dar Es Salaam and worked on the issue with then Ambassador Leonhart.
                    We struggled to try to get me over there. Eventually the Zanzibaris agreed and I
                    went.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Two independent countries. It was later, in fact it at least partly our
                    design, I think it was Bill Leonhart's idea as a matter of fact, that Tanganyika
                    swallow up Zanzibar as a way of getting rid of the communist influence in
                    Zanzibar. And eventually that proved to work, but it took time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, why were we pressing to develop or resume relations
                        witthis rather small, little island nation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: There was a lot of the focus on it. It was being called the African
                    Cuba. But we also had a NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]
                    tracking station in Zanzibar which NASA at least thought was quite important.
                    When I got to Zanzibar, I concluded that it was hopeless and we would have to
                    dismantle the tracking station.</p>
                <p>Q: What was it that in your estimate... In the first place, how did these
                    negotiations go with Zanzibar? What was your role, what were the contacts
                    like?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, the contacts, there were multiple channels. Basically, sometimes
                    using the British, sometimes working with other African countries, or sometimes
                    using Tanganyika to get in touch with the Zanzibaris. Eventually, Amani Abeid
                    Karume, who was president, agreed that we could come back in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the rationality from their point of view to bring
                        uback in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I can't really answer that. I assume they didn't want to be totally
                    isolated from the western world. Karume himself was not a communist. The
                    government under him was basically communist and Karume was not a very
                    sophisticated man (He was later assassinated.). He had a certain amount of good
                    will toward the west. I assume that eventually he prevailed, allowing us to come
                    back in. One of the reasons that I think I got kicked out was that I managed to
                    develop a good relationship with Karume. Karume spoke very little English and at
                    one point I asked him what I could do to develop better relations with Zanzibar.
                    He said learn Swahili, so I set to work and learned it. I was the only senior
                    diplomat on the island who could converse with him in Swahili and he loved that.
                    So we had a very good relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well when you arrived there in early '64, what was the
                        situatiofrom your perspective on the island?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It was pretty chaotic. People would be thrown in jail left and right.
                    Asians sometimes literally were whipped in the streets. Mosques had been invaded
                    and people killed. All land had been nationalized. The British club became the
                    people's club, which was advantageous to me because tennis balls then became
                    free and I was the only westerner left who played tennis. I found [locals] who
                    could play with me.</p>
                <p>There was just a lot of hostility toward the West. The Soviets and the Chinese
                    flooded the place. There were well over a 100 Soviets attached to their embassy
                    and the East Germans had a very significant presence. All doctors had fled
                    except one female Asian doctor. The only doctors on the island were East German.
                    We had a North Vietnamese embassy. We had a North Korean embassy and a very
                    substantial Chinese communist presence, hardly matched by a very small British
                    and American presence. I think there were three of us, a vice consul, one other
                    officer, and a secretary or two. A very small British presence and that was it
                    as far as the West was concerned.</p>
                <p>Q: To me, one oenigmas is the large Chinese, at that time called Communist
                    Chinese, presence in Africa which seemed to often have quite large missions and
                    they were doing things, and yet I haven't heard anybody say it had any
                    particular influence as far as getting involved. What was your impression in
                    Zanzibar?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: My impression was that the lead country for the Communists was
                    EasGermany. They had the most influence. They had a young, attractive
                    ambassador, although the Soviets sent one of their most senior ambassadors. He
                    had been ambassador to Canada. I think clearly the Soviets and the East Germans
                    exercised more influence than the Chinese.</p>
                <p>Q: Were the East Germans heavily into the security side as far as secret police
                    and that sort of thing, because that seemed to be their specialty?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes, they got into that and they got into the media and the education
                    system. They were building houses. Some of their projects turned out to be
                    disasters. I managed to get one small aid project going. I built a school which
                    I'm told is still functioning in Zanzibar today.</p>
                <p>Q: With the expulsion of the Arabs, I would have thought that this would have
                    been a disaster for the economy in Africa. Had the Arabs been sort of the
                    merchant class and that type of thing?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The economy essentially was closed-tourism and some small trade. The
                    economy spiraled down, such as it was. It wasn't a very significant economy to
                    start with. They just planned to live on aid from the then Soviet Bloc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems getting the small aid project
                        rolling?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh, yes. I had difficulty getting it accepted. Once again the President
                    had agreed to it and he actually, as I recall, came out and dedicated the school
                    which was fairly major event because we couldn't get anybody even to attend our
                    Fourth of July party. One of my neighbors, a minister named Jumbe, who later
                    became vice president, had a tendency to drink a bit and one night he came over
                    to my house. No sooner did he come in than the police arrived and essentially
                    told him to get out. We were pretty much isolated. We were socially ostracized.
                    Virtually every Sunday there would be a demonstration against me. I would get my
                    tear gas [mask] and my beer and I'd go to the embassy and watch the
                    demonstrators. They would go around the block about three or four times to
                    exaggerate the numbers. Sometimes I'd go down and mix with them as they were
                    getting ready to demonstrate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any focus or was there just...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Anti-American. It got serious when the Belgians senparatroopers into
                    Stanleyville.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Dragon Rouge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes. That's the one time the demonstration got quite serious. By then
                    we had had some Tanganyika police on the island. They managed to keep the
                    demonstrators from breaking into the embassy. I guess it was then a consulate
                    general because technically we had merged with Tanganyika. That demonstration by
                    the way was led by the chief of protocol.</p>
                <p>Q: How did this...Let's talk first about the NASA station. It was a space
                    monitoring station was it? Had it been running during the time that we had no
                    relations with the country?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: No, I think it had been shut down temporarily. There were some NASA
                    people-I'm not even sure if the NASA people stayed, they may have been
                    evacuated. It was essentially dormant when I got there. To get back to the aura
                    of your question, the only reason Zanzibar was important was U.S. domestic
                    politics. I can remember before I left, Averell Harriman, who was Under
                    Secretary of State, called me in and gave me essentially two instructions; get
                    the NASA tracking station back in operation and to make sure that Zanzibar was
                    not a political embarrassment to President Johnson during the campaign. Those
                    were two difficult tasks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Zanzibar at all on the political map? Did you
                        havcorrespondence coming in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh, yes. There was quite a bit of press about the “African Cuba.” It
                    had become, I don't want to say it was a major story, but it had become at least
                    a significant story in the U.S. press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to do anything about that or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, there was eventually, as I said, we merged with Tanganyika and
                    the situation moderated, but that was over a period of time. During the first
                    year, it was pretty chaotic. We didn't manage to score any major victory, I
                    guess I'd have to say although it was clear that our influence was increasing as
                    time wore on. To the extent that our influence increased, the Soviets and
                    Chinese influence decreased and I was warned that they were going to try and get
                    me.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there a Soviet fleet presence there? If I recall, about this time, this
                    was not too long after the Cuban Missile Crisis which was '62 and the Soviets
                    really didn't have a very major fleet.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: No, there was no Soviet fleet there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean it was really in the '70s when the Blue Seas Navy
                        wadeveloped.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: No, it was really a civilian presence but they would spread scare
                    stories. I can remember one time being called off the tennis court by the
                    President of the country who said to me, “There's an American submarine
                    surfacing in our waters. Get it out of here.” Of course there was no American
                    submarine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you conduct...What would a day's work be there
                        for yowhen you say you were pretty well quarantined against most
                        contacts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The ministers would receive me in their offices and I had pretty good
                    access to the President. When I asked to call on the President, invariably they
                    would agree and I used to have some fairly good and lengthy conversations with
                    him. Essentially, my time was spent providing political analysis, observing what
                    was going on, establishing as many contacts as I could, talking to my colleagues
                    in the British embassy, talking to the Israeli consul general, seeing what they
                    had found. I also had some contact with the Soviets. The Soviet ambassador
                    became quite friendly. I remember he brought my daughter one of those Soviet
                    dolls. And I spent a fair amount of time, at least in the early portion of my
                    stay, learning Swahili.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were having these conversations with the
                        President, whawere the subjects?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Trying to reassure him of our desire for a mutually beneficial
                    relationship and to convince him that a lot of the stories that he'd been
                    reading about us were not accurate. I talked to him about ways in we could help
                    Zanzibar, working with him on the school project. Essentially, trying to regain
                    their confidence because there were a lot of misleading and inaccurate stories
                    that had been spread about the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about relations with Tanganyika? Did you go over
                        therfairly frequently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes, I did. I never looked forward to the trip because the only way of
                    getting over was a 1930, I think it was a '30s DeHavilland aircraft, which could
                    hold about four or five people. The pilot, I remember, would pull out his novel
                    the minute the wheels got off the ground, which was always a bit
                    disconcerting.</p>
                <p>Q: We're talking today, the 30th of June and on the 26th of June, Ambassador
                    Leonhart died. Unfortunately, I never interviewed him. What was your impression
                    of his support and how he ran his embassy?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: His support as far as I was concerned was absolutely outstanding. He
                    and I had an extremely good relationship. Bill Leonhart was a brilliant man. I'd
                    have to describe him an intense man, a workaholic who spent hours and hours and
                    hours in the embassy. No cable left his embassy unless it was perfect. He worked
                    it over. I think he ran a really tight embassy. But he was always receptive to
                    ideas from me and would take them and make them better if they were good ideas.
                    He'd come up with a lot of ideas himself. I had such high regard for him, that
                    when I later became deputy director of the CIA, I brought him over to the CIA
                    and put him on a review panel for our analytical shop.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you play any part, or our embassy in Tanganyika play
                        anpart, in this merger of Zanzibar and Tanganyika into Tanzania?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The answer to that is yes. I'm not sure exactly how Bill Leonhart did
                    it, but clearly he played a significant role in it. Whether he convinced Julius
                    Nyerere on a one to one basis or whether there were other channels that were
                    used, I can't say because I was not party to those conversations. But I knew
                    that Bill broached the idea to me long before it happened so there's something
                    that was germinating at least through our embassy in Tanganyika.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you reporting from the Zanzibar side as far as
                        you sathrough receptivity of the people on Zanzibar to this greater
                        merger?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I think it was a mixed bag. The Communists were not favorable to it.
                    They saw it as loss of authority for them. Karume was very much in favor of it.
                    I think it was seen as a threat by the Revolutionary Council. Those were the
                    days where African unity was very important. You could not argue with the idea
                    of African unity. It was a hard concept for them to argue against.</p>
                <p>Q: As far as being in Zanzibar itself, was this a subject you could raise at all
                    or was this something that almost better if you didn't raise this?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I can't recall whether I actually raised it. If I did, the only one
                    that I could have talked to about it would have been the President. Certainly
                    none of the Communist ministers had any kind of dialogue with me on that
                    subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Soviets and the Chinese? Were they involved
                        ithis trying to stop this thing or were they...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Not overtly. What they did behind the scenes I can'say. Clearly they
                    were involved in getting me and Bob Gordon expelled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bob Gordon was your...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: He was the DCM in Dar Es Salaam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The DCM, okay. Did you find that the East Germans, for
                        example,were following you or harassing you or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: No. To the best of my knowledge nobody followed me or harassed me. The
                    East Germans and I never talked because we didn't have relations. We would
                    frequently be standing near each other in ceremonies. Everybody would gush all
                    over him and ignore me.</p>
                <p>Q: It must have been a little awkward on a small island with the diplomatic
                    corps. You had the East Germans that we didn't recognize, the Vietnamese who we
                    didn't recognize and the North Koreans that we didn't recognize?</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The only people at ceremonies I could talk to were the Brit, the
                    Israeli, and the Soviet. I'd have to listen to all the diatribes. In one of the
                    more humorous incidents, I decided to visit the neighboring island oPemba, which
                    was being run by a Commissar, named Ali Sultan Issa, a man who was trained in
                    Beijing. He was so indoctrinated that he insisted we even share the same bed.
                    “This is the way we do it in the People's democracy.” He took me around the
                    island with people chanting and singing since it was in the “workers paradise.”
                    Then he had a rally and meeting and I could see during the rally, this was in
                    the early stages of my stay, that he would point at me and the crowd would
                    applaud and yell and scream. So I asked someone what he was saying and he told
                    me he was saying, “There's the enemy. Why don't you applaud or don't you think
                    we ought to throw the Americans out?” Right then and there, I decided that
                    learning Swahili was essential.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought that you would have been up against all these groups and
                    you being sort of the butt of their attacks and speeches and all that at any
                    ceremony you went to, you could almost stand up with a target painted on you or
                    something like this. You must have had to make the decision, do I just stand
                    here and smile or keep a stern face or what do you do?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Just smile and roll with the punches. There was one other African that
                    I could talk to. He was the Chairman of the Afro-Shirazi party, Thabit Kombo,
                    who was probably in his 70s or 80s at the time, and was such a revered figure in
                    Zanzibar that he could talk to me without fear of retaliation. He and the
                    President were essentially the only two that I could talk to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Turning again to the NASA station, they opened it up,
                        reopened iwhile you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: No. Well I can't recall, to be honest with you, whether it was open for
                    a brief period or not. I doubt it. We had to negotiate its removal and of course
                    we stalled for time. Time was an issue because the government was demanding that
                    we remove it within a matter of weeks and NASA said that just couldn't be done.
                    It was very valuable equipment, which they wanted to get out. So I spent a lot
                    of time trying to negotiate a reasonable period for dismantling the station.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feeling about NASA one way or the
                        other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Of course, the communists had thoroughly planted the idea that this was
                    a spy station; it was all run by the CIA and so the situation was almost
                    hopeless. Everybody believed that it was a spy station.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the Soviets, because if I recall, although space flight was in its
                    early stages in those days, yet we had made offers that if the Soviets had a
                    space problem they could use our space facilities and vice versa. Did they play
                    any part in it?</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I'd have to assume that the Soviets were behind the campaign to force
                    us to remove our tracking station. That the attacks came from the communists,
                    there is no question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the press. Is there anything to report on the
                        press?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It was entirely government controlled. Anything the government wanted
                    they'd give to the press. There was no free press. The only way that I could
                    know about the real world was through tuning in VOA [Voice of America] on my
                    radio.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice any difference when Zanzibar and Tanganyika
                        becamTanzania? You were there during the initial stages of the
                        amalgamation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes. I went from being charg� to being consul general.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you notice how the amalgamation was working at that point?</p>
                <p>BARLUCCI: Well, very slowly. We virtually couldn't feel any effects in Zanzibar,
                    other than as I mentioned earlier we finally negotiated getting some Tanganyika
                    policemen into Zanzibar. This was the first tangible presence. The island was
                    very unwilling to give up its de facto independence.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you do a little compare and contrast between the way things were run in
                    Zanzibar while you were there and what you'd seen in the former Belgian
                    Congo?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, there was a certain similarity obviously. There was initial
                    hostility toward the west but in the case of the Congo, there had not been the
                    kind of thorough Communist penetration that you'd had in Zanzibar. The Congolese
                    didn't know what communism was, although some of our politicians, particularly
                    Senator Dodd, called them Communists - Senator Tom Dodd, not Chris Dodd, the
                    son. The Zanzibaris, a lot of them, had been to school in Moscow or in Beijing.
                    They were much more sophisticated in their approach. Both situations were
                    chaotic of course. I suppose the Congo might have been slightly more dangerous.
                    We regarded Zanzibar as not particularly dangerous, although some people were
                    killed. Of course during the revolution, a great number were killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The similarity is the extreme nationalism and the
                        anti-westerovertones.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: They were more explicit in Zanzibar than they were in the Congo.
                    Zanzibar at least had a resolution. The Congo has never found its
                    resolution.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Q: You were seeing the products of the Soviet training of Communists. Did you
                    find that the people coming out of then named Lumumba University in the Soviet
                    Union were pretty fairly indoctrinated?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh, yes. The big thing was the young pioneers, which was East Germany.
                    I can remember large numbers of Zanzibaris being taken to East Germany and
                    coming back as young pioneers in uniforms. Indoctrination was pretty thorough.
                    Lumumba University hadn't really been established when I was in the Congo. By
                    the time I got to Zanzibar, it was in full swing and there were large numbers of
                    Zanzibaris, way out of proportion to their population, going to places like East
                    Germany and Moscow and Beijing to study.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find any, were there any, Tanganyikan officials
                        startinto drift over that you could talk to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: No. Not outside of the police. Even then I didn't have much contact.
                    There was a Zanzibari police chief that I could talk to. He was not totally
                    hostile to the West, but he was subsequently removed. While I was there, you
                    could not feel much Tanganyikan presence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you expulsion come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Bob Gordon and I were having a phone conversation. This is about
                    January of '65. We were discussing a message of congratulations on the second
                    anniversary of the revolution. We did something very foolish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you calling from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I was in Zanzibar. And Bob Gordon was the DCM in Dar Es Salaam, Bill
                    Leonhart's deputy. We started to double talk, which you should never do; it's
                    easily decipherable. We started talking about the anniversary of the revolution
                    and shouldn't we send a message, meaning a message of congratulations. Bob said,
                    “Well, they are very reluctant in Washington and you will need more ammunition”
                    meaning a stronger argument to make our case. I said, “I want to come over and
                    discuss this.”I flew over and I was at the home of Jack Mower, one of our
                    embassy officials. He had the radio on and the radio announced that Bob Gordon
                    and I had been expelled.</p>
                <p>Bill Leonhart went to Nyerere and said, “What's this all about?”</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Nyerere said, “We have a tape of this conversation.” And when Nyerere described
                    it, it was obvious the tape had been doctored in some way to make it appear that
                    we were plotting to overthrow the government of Zanzibar.</p>
                <p>I went to see Karume, who even under those circumstances received me. He said
                    this was wrong and should not happen. It was the Tanzanian government now that
                    had expelled me, not the Zanzibar government. He said he'd call Nyerere, but
                    there was nothing much more he could do. There seemed to be no alternative, so I
                    left. A number of years later, I was at a reception at the State Department. A
                    big Russian came up and almost swept me off my feet and said, “Don't you
                    remember me?”</p>
                <p>I said, “I'm not sure.”</p>
                <p>He said, Well, I'm so and so. I was the Tass correspondent iZanzibar when you
                    were there.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Then maybe you can satisfy my curiosity. Who was it that plotted my
                    expulsion and doctored the tape. Was it you Soviets or the East Germans?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Oh, we were all in it together.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting though that Nyerere got into this because
                        hcertainly must have...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, apparently somebody took the tape to the cabinet and played it
                    for the entire cabinet. Of course the more radical members of the cabinet,
                    insisted that we be expelled. What position Nyerere took in that cabinet meeting
                    I don't know to this day. Don Peterson, who was my vice consul, later became
                    ambassador to Tanzania. He told me that he had a conversation with Nyerere, this
                    is years later, and Nyerere said they had made a mistake and that I was welcome
                    to come back. But I don't know what transpired in that Cabinet meeting. I
                    thought my career was at an end that day.</p>
                <p>Q: I think it's interesting to comment on this in the spirit of the times. Did
                    you find that the atmosphere, no matter what you did, if you got expelled it was
                    somehow your fault even though it may have been part of the machinations of
                    hostile powers?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I thought Harriman was - Bob Gordon and I had lunch with him - seemed
                    to understand the situation. But I was called into the office of the director
                    general of the Foreign Service, Joe Palmer. He had a totally clean desk. I'll
                    never forget it. He had my file sitting there. I had been promoted fast until
                    then. In fact, in the old system I was an O-3 and only 35 years old.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those days, about equivalent to a colonel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I was the youngest, I think, at the time. He said, “Well, young man,
                    you're obviously intelligent, you've got ability, and you'll probably go to the
                    top of the service, but you're very impulsive, very free wheeling and you must
                    learn to fit into the system.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Sir, all due respect, I don't really want to fit into thsystem.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well you're going to have to learn to fit into the systeand you are
                    going to a big embassy in Europe.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I'm not interested in a big embassy.” He said, “You are going.”</p>
                <p>He put me in an Italian course and I was scheduled to go as Transportation
                    Officer to Rome, which I certainly did not look forward to. I struggled mightily
                    to get out of that job and finally succeeded when Lincoln Gordon asked for me to
                    go to Brazil. The director general said well maybe I could go to Brazil, and
                    maybe that embassy was large enough, provided I was buried down in the embassy.
                    I think I went five years without a promotion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you treated by others in the Foreign Service? Did
                        yohave a feeling that this person was PNG (persona non grata) maybe...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I didn't feel any real hostility from my colleagues. Obviously, we'd
                    done something that wasn't terribly wise-in fact, it was downright dumb. I think
                    the Foreign Service wrote [it] up to show how not to conduct a telephone
                    conversation, and sent it to all posts. But, other than that, I think people
                    recognized it was a difficult situation over there.</p>
                <p>Q: If I recall, I think somebody else got at least in trouble and developed a
                    hostile press and that was in Pakistan for also using a term “ammunition,” which
                    we often use in just the way we talk which means data - “I need some more
                    ammunition for this.” President Bhutto, not Benazir but her father, got this on
                    a wire tap and I can't remember what happened but somebody else was given a
                    rough time on this damned phrase.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, obviously thereafter, I was very careful about what I said on the
                    telephone. I would never double talk. I took the lesson seriously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Brazil in, would it be in '65 still?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes. I finished the Italian course. That took me pretty much through
                    the summer of '65. I think it was about the fall of '65 that I went to Brazil,
                    speaking Italian.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that was handy. It probably would have been much
                        handieif you'd gone to Argentina in a way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: In fact I remember negotiating my apartment lease iItalian because it
                    was owned by an Italian. Then I learned Portuguese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there until about 1970?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: In Brazil? '65 through '68, I believe. Well, maybe even the beginning
                    of '69. It think I came back to Washington in late 1968 I guess it was.</p>
                <p>Q: You say Lincoln Gordon, who was a presidential appointee, an economist, and
                    very much involved in the Marshall Plan was sent to Brazil. How had he heard
                    about you?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: He was already ambassador to Brazil. I had a friend in the ARA [Bureau
                    of Inter-American Affairs], Tan Baber, who was, I think, executive director or
                    deputy executive director. It was quite well-known that I didn't want to go to
                    Italy. He said, “Why don't you have a session with Lincoln Gordon?” Gordon is a
                    brilliant man who later became president of Johns Hopkins. But he is given to
                    talking a lot. I had one of the strangest interviews I've had in my life. I went
                    in; he asked me what university I went to and I gave the right answer there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Princeton is it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I think he'd gone to Princeton. Then I said, “You know, I'd be very
                    interested in the situation in Brazil.”One hour later I'd barely said a word and
                    Lincoln Gordon thought I was brilliant. So he went to Joe Palmer and tried to
                    get me to go to Brazil. He wanted me to go as principal officer in Brasilia
                    replacing Herb Okun, but Joe Palmer said, “No.”</p>
                <p>Lincoln said, “Well, can I have him in the embassy?”</p>
                <p>Palmer said, “As long as you bury him.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were not to be trusted with a separate mission.</hi>

                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: We'd had the Carlos Costello Bronco government, military government,
                    albeit a fairly enlightened military government with a very large American aid
                    program. We had some 900 Americans in Brazil. Our influence was pervasive. We
                    had Roberto Campos as the Finance Minister [Financ/1e Minister during General
                    Castelo Branco's presidency, 1964-1967], known as Bob Fields because he was so
                    pro-American. But you also had a certain simmering social situation in Brazil
                    which continued to go unresolved, and indeed needs more attention today. We had
                    a large military presence as well. We had a big MAAG [Military Assistance
                    Advisory Group] with, if I remember the situation correctly, two generals and an
                    admiral. This gets into another story, but Lincoln Gordon was replaced by Jack
                    Tuthill, who started the TOPSY operation. He pulled me up from my job in the
                    political section, promoted me to position of executive officer of the embassy.
                    In fact, I became the chief administrator of the embassy. The DCM at the time,
                    Phil Raine, was much more interested in the political side. He was de facto
                    political counselor and I as an FS-03 and was, in effect, the closest thing to a
                    DCM in the embassy. I was given the responsibility for implementing the TOPSY
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the TOPSY program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: This was an effort by Jack Tuthill - interesting story how it got
                    started. Tuthill was a marvelous man. He died about four or five months ago - a
                    wonderful person to work with. I've been fortunate in my career that I worked
                    with some great people. He called me in one day, and he said, “Frank, this
                    embassy is too large. Who is the most useless person in the embassy?”</p>
                <p>I thought for a minute and I said, “Well, the assistant sciencattach� is a good
                    tennis player, but he doesn't do much.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Get rid of him.”</p>
                <p>I went to work on that. Tuthill called me back in about a month otwo later and
                    said, “How's it going on getting rid of Mr. X?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Gee, Mr. Ambassador, I've never had such a difficult job.This guy is
                    useless, but everybody in Washington is defending him.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, I've been thinking. It probably wouldn't be much harder to get
                    rid of half the embassy than it is to get rid of one person.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I think you're probably right.”</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>He said, “Well, I'll think about that.”</p>
                <p>He came back from lunch one day and went into his office, came out and walked
                    into my little office and handed me a draft cable and said, “What do you think
                    of this?”</p>
                <p>It was a cable back to Washington saying, “I request authority to cut the staff
                    by 50 percent.” I went back into his office and I said, “Well, it probably needs
                    to be done, basically for political reasons, but, Mr. Ambassador, you at least
                    have to allow the different sections of the embassy to comment on this before
                    you send it.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Alright.” He called everybody into his office and he said,“You can
                    comment.”</p>
                <p>And as I left his office, the general in charge of the MAAG said,“Well, you of
                    course don't mean us?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Oh, yes, I do.” He said to everybody, “Get your commentin to Frank by
                    noon tomorrow.”</p>
                <p>And all the comments came in. And the comments of the MAAG were a marvel to
                    behold because they said, “If you cut us by 50 percent, we'll lose space in the
                    ministry of war; we'll lose some hanger space; we may have to give up one of our
                    airplanes, and we might even have to close the PX.”</p>
                <p>Jack Tuthill said, “Frank, you respond to all the other comments. want to respond
                    to this one.” And he had a field day.</p>
                <p>We sent the cable and then Tuthill and I went to Washington and walked the halls
                    arguing for a 50 percent cut. We got all the way to Katzenbaum, who was deputy
                    secretary at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nicholas Katzenbaum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes, Nicholas Katzenbaum. We got his support, but that support kind of
                    evaporated as we got lower in the building. There were something like 18
                    agencies represented in Brazil and the State Department didn't control those
                    agencies. They were the hardest to deal with. We brought in a special task force
                    to look at the CIA. Eventually, after a year, of full time effort on my part and
                    probably 80 percent of the Ambassador's time, we ended up with a cut of about 30
                    percent. I went in with trepidation to tell Tuthill that was the size of the cut
                    we were finally ending up with and he said, “That's about what I expected.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now how did the name TOPSY develop?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I think Tuthill coined it. He said this place just grew like TOPSY
                    [Note: a literary character from the 19th century novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin]. He
                    pointed to an AID request that had come out asking us to do a study on rats,
                    bats, and noxious birds in Brazil. He had a great deal of fun with that one,
                    too.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your position on this operation TOPSY, as the implementer? I would
                    have thought that this would have been more dangerous, in a way, than the Congo
                    - a walk in the embassy...</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It was and when Tuthill left I became very vulnerable. Before he left,
                    he made me political counselor, but I was not a very popular man in the embassy.
                    I took a different point of view than much of the senior staff. For example,
                    when I was political counselor, there was another institutional act decreed by
                    the government, the fifth institutional act, I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the government of Brazil?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The government of Brazil. We suspended our aid program. Most of the top
                    level of the embassy was pushing to restart the aid program. The embassy became
                    badly divided. A lot of the younger officers fought against reinstituting the
                    aid program and I sided with them, but I was the only one on the senior staff.
                    Those were the days before we had a dissent channel. The embassy, the aid
                    people, drafted a cable which the DCM, charg� now, favored saying let's restart
                    the program. I said, “If you send that cable I'm going to enter a formal
                    dissent.” The cable was never sent and the program was not restarted for an
                    appropriate period of time.</p>
                <p>Q: Why don't we stop at this point and we'll pick it up again. We're still in
                    Brazil. We've talked about operation TOPSY, but let's talk about the next time
                    about relations with the Brazilian government as you saw them, developments
                    there, personalities, particular military. Was Vernon Walters there?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I ghostwrote the fitness report that got him his firsstar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we'll talk obviously about Vernon Walters and other
                        elements...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: My first assignment when I was buried in the political section of the
                    embassy was to report Vernon Walters' conversations. He and the president of
                    Brazil had a close personal relationship. Walters would come back from Sunday
                    dinner with the president and on Monday he'd give me a stream of consciousness
                    and my job was to take it and put it into State “Departmentese.” Walters had a
                    fantastic memory. He could remember the conversation word for word, but that
                    wasn't suitable for reporting.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll pick that up and we'll also pick up starting from
                        what youfirst job was in the embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 3rd of October 1997. Frank, something you'd mentioned earlier on -
                    there was the issue of do you renew aid to the Brazilians. I think you said
                    there was a split between the young officers, yourself included, and the older
                    officers at the embassy as to whether we should keep the pressure on or relax it
                    a bit. Do you recall that?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well this occurred towards the end of my tour after Jack Tuthill had
                    left. I of course was not the most popular fellow in the embassy having been
                    hatchet man from TOPSY and being fairly low ranking to be political counselor. I
                    think I was still an FS-03. Bill Belton was charg� d'affaires and Bill was very
                    much a traditionalist. The Brazilians had implemented another institutional act
                    (I think it was the fifth.) and the U.S. government had frowned upon that and
                    had suspended aid. After about, I would judge, two or three weeks, the powers
                    that be in AID in the embassy, accompanied by the economic side, the economic
                    counselor and his people, began to urge that aid be reinstituted. This provoked
                    a good deal of concern on the part of the younger officers, myself included,
                    although I was a little older than they were. We protested. It came down to a
                    meeting in the charg�'s office where the charg� went around the table and all
                    the senior people said they favored the resumption of aid and had drafted a
                    cable to this effect. I didn't say much at the time and then the cable was
                    passed around. I read it and towards the end of the meeting, I simply said if
                    you send this cable, I request that the following sentence be put on the end.
                    The political counselor dissents from this cable and reserves the right to write
                    his own cable. Those were the days before we had dissent channels. Dissent was
                    not very much in vogue and there was somewhat a startled reaction in the room.
                    But Bill Belton said, “Well, if Frank's got these reservations, we need to
                    consider them,” and the cable did not go. In essence the embargo on aid programs
                    continued for another month or so.</p>
                <p>Q: I was wondering - this may be almost philosophical - but could you explain,
                    this is a scenario that has played out quite often where the most senior
                    officers at an embassy on something don't want to disrupt relations and to make
                    things good and the more junior members say “The hell with it, we have a policy
                    and we've got to stick it to them.” Can you talk a little about, in general,
                    your observations of the dynamics of youth versus age? ?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I suppose youth is more prone to risk taking and taking strong
                    positions than those of us who have reached, shall we say middle age, or a
                    little bit more. I think that's a very healthy characteristic. Studies have
                    generally indicated too that people tend to be more liberal in their younger
                    years than their older years. You don't get so much in a rut and your views
                    don't become so formalized. You're more open to new ideas and new approaches. I
                    think I told you in the last session that I was lectured by the then Director
                    General on my free wheeling approach and maybe that was part of the function of
                    youth although I'd like to think that I still am able to think a little bit
                    outside the box.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you became political counselor, what was your
                        impression othe Brazilian government at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: When I first came to the embassy, Carlos Costello Bronco was president,
                    a military man - a very competent military man - who was guiding the country, I
                    felt, toward a more democratic system. He was succeeded by another general,
                    Costa e Silva, who candidly speaking didn't have Carlos Costello Bronco's
                    intellect. In fact, the Brazilians, as you know, like jokes and he became the
                    butt of jokes all around Brazil. His alleged low IQ was always poked fun at. He
                    was a rather stolid figure, quite unimaginative, basically a place holder. We
                    enjoyed cordial relations with him and Ambassador Jack Tuthill would see him
                    fairly frequently. I used to serve as Jack's interpreter in some of these
                    meetings. I accompanied Tuthill to the meeting when Tuthill told Costa e Silva
                    we were going to start the TOPSY program, cut the staff by 50%. Everybody in the
                    embassy had predicted that the Brazilian reaction would be very negative to
                    TOPSY. On the contrary. Costa Silva's reaction to the TOPSY program was quite
                    favorable. He understood the political ramifications so he was quite supportive
                    throughout that exercise.</p>
                <p>Q: With Vernon Walters having these ties going back, it was sort of legendary he
                    was the liaison officer to the Brazilian division during World War II in Italy
                    and all. What was your impression of how this translated into helping us?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh, I think Dick Walters was probably the single most influential
                    American. When he spoke, they listened. He had a marvelous relationship with
                    Carlos Costello Bronco.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think so, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: When Dick served as the liaison officer, Dick would go around on
                    Sunday, practically every Sunday night, for a one on one dinner with Carlos
                    Costello Bronco. There was hardly a military man in Brazil that Dick Walters
                    didn't know and have a relationship with. He was admired and respected and as
                    you know he was extraordinarily fluent in Portuguese - probably the best
                    Portuguese speaker - in the embassy. He played a very key role in U.S.-
                    Brazilian relations. Dick pretty much confined his activities to the military
                    side. He didn't get involved in questions of aid policy, the kind of things we
                    were just discussing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the ambassador use him because I imagine with a
                        militargovernment, this was a very important aspect?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes. Tuthill liked and admired Dick Walters and from time to time when
                    he wanted to get a message across he would ask Dick Walters to convey the
                    message. Tuthill was never very status conscious. He didn't have a sense of
                    insecurity because Dick Walters had more access than he did. That didn't bother
                    him at all. He viewed Dick as an asset and worked rather closely with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As political counselor, did this intrude upon you work
                        or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: On the contrary. I felt like Tuthill did, that Dick Walters was an
                    enormous asset. I worked extremely closely with Dick. I decided it would be
                    useful if I got to know the military myself and Dick was only too happy to
                    introduce me. I also got myself as political counselor named assistant director
                    of AID and would attend the AID meetings and work with them to shape a program
                    that I thought was more politically acceptable.</p>
                <p>Q: How were your relations, when you were political counselor, with AID because
                    often, particularly in that era, AID tended to be an agency on its own and it
                    has its own dynamics and all that?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: There's no question there was that. I had been through the TOPSY
                    exercise. I understood the aid program quite well as a result. So when I moved
                    over to the job as political counselor, and I said to the AID director, Bill
                    Ellis at the time, “It would be useful if I continued the relationship. I'd like
                    to have a title and go to the staff meetings and contribute what I could to the
                    program.”</p>
                <p>Bill welcomed it and I carried through on that undertaking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was AID integrated into furthering our political
                        objectiveat this time would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Both Tuthill and I felt that large numbers of technical people - while
                    each individual may contribute to progress and to good relations - the
                    cumulative impact of such large numbers was bad. It tended to create a sense of
                    dependency, while we really were trying to encourage Brazilians to do more on
                    their own. Our goal was to try and reduce the numbers and obviously to get the
                    resources down to a manageable level and to try to move the Brazilians to take
                    up more of the slack. We also tried to point the programs in the certain areas
                    that we felt were critical-education would be one of them-and to change the
                    focus of the programs from trying to do everything to trying to do the things we
                    thought were going to give the democratic forces in Brazil the greatest
                    leverage.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Q: Did Brazil, with their young people going away to universities and all...I
                    always think of Chile and other places where you have the University of Chicago
                    boys and all that. Was there anything of this nature developing in Brazil or
                    were they going back to Portugal to universities? What were the dynamics there
                    for foreign higher education?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well there were some that had very close connections with the United
                    States. Robert Campos was Minister of Finance and he was known as Bob Fields
                    which is a humorous translation of Roberto Campos. That's because he was so
                    pro-American, spoke fluent English, so there were close associations. I don't
                    recall there being a University of Chicago school or anything like that, but I
                    remember Brazilians had substantial exposure to the U.S. educational system.</p>
                <p>Q: What about their economic planners? Did they seem to be going a different
                    course? So many of these countries, particularly in those days, were going for a
                    status as opposed to a more open, free wheeling system. What were the
                    atmospherics?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, certainly Roberto Campos and Delfim Neto, who was the finance
                    minister, seemed very receptive to building a private sector. They were a long
                    way from where Brazil is today on issues such as privatization. That wasn't very
                    much in vogue. There were large government-owned companies and there was no
                    effort to privatize those. On the other hand, they were trying to stimulate a
                    market economy. It's just that Brazil had enormous economic problems at the
                    time. It was like trying to turn an aircraft carrier. It moved very slowly.</p>
                <p>Q: What about on the economic side, particularly, we have a Consulate General on
                    the pad for a long time in Sao Paulo which is really almost another capital on
                    its own, isn't it, as far as industry? Was it difficult being the political
                    counselor? Did you find it was almost another dynamic coming out of Sao Paulo as
                    far as our people there?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Sao Paulo didn't do a lot of political reporting. They confined
                    themselves to commercial and counselor work. The larger issue was the move to
                    Brasilia. I had an apartment in Brasilia and basically shuttled back and forth.
                    The Brazilian politicians at the time hated Brasilia. The less amount of time
                    they could spend there the better. But Sao Paulo, I don't recall Sao Paulo
                    playing a very significant political role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the move to Brasilia, what was our impression at the
                        time?Was this a pain in the neck or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes. We all liked Rio and the Brazilian politicians liked Rio. Brasilia
                    was in the middle of nowhere. It was a long flight. They would spend the least
                    amount of time possible there. Generally two or three days a week. Air travel
                    was free for the politicians. It proved very useful to me because simply by
                    flying I could get to meet all the Brazilian politicians. I got to know quite a
                    number of them that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine that these flights would end up as
                        politicacaucuses in a way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: They did indeed. And the liquor flowed freely on thflights. It was a
                    very congenial atmosphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find it quite useful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes, I found it very useful. I actually came to rather like my trips to
                    Brasilia because I thought it was fun. I enjoyed going around the halls of
                    Congress.</p>
                <p>Q: As the political counselor, what was your impression and how did you deal with
                    the political class as opposed to the military?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, it was a little hard to distinguish between the political class
                    and the military class. The country was being run by the military, but there was
                    a political class growing up. I made an effort to get to know them. Sometimes
                    those efforts were controversial. The principal opposition politician was a man
                    named Carlos Lacerda who had been governor of Guanabana and had run for
                    president. He was a brilliant man. I had gotten to know his son and tangentially
                    gotten to know him. I did something extraordinarily controversial. I set up a
                    meeting between Tuthill and Carlos Lacerda. The result was that the President,
                    Costa e Silva, called Tuthill in and complained about the meeting. Basically, he
                    complained not about Tuthill, but about me for having set it up. The meeting
                    became headlines in the newspapers and I became quite a controversial
                    figure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this politician legitimate opposition, so this was not
                        gointo the underground or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Of course not. But that's a concept that was a little hard for the
                    military people to grasp when they're in control of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Tuthill respond?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Tuthill liked the meeting, he liked Lacerda and he thoughit was the
                    right thing to do.</p>
                <p>Q: Were we sitting around at a country team meeting and saying well, Brazil is
                    eventually going to get rid of the military and we have a new political class is
                    going to emerge with whom we have to be on good terms and identify who they are
                    going to be. No matter what the military says, we've got to get ready for that
                    day and working on that?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Essentially that was the message I was trying to get out. Nobody would
                    argue with that, but everybody had their day-to-day business and the
                    institutional forces take hold. If you are AID, you want to continue to do
                    business with the people you are doing business with. You're not necessarily in
                    favor of change. I was probably the one who was arguing most forcefully for
                    change. Tuthill essentially agreed with me-or I agreed with him I guess would be
                    a better way of putting it-because he was the leader in the embassy. It all
                    worked well as long as Tuthill was there. When Tuthill left, I became, as I
                    said, a little more vulnerable.</p>
                <p>Q: During the Tuthill period, what about the mid and junior level political
                    officers in the embassy. I would think it would be difficult for them to get out
                    and see military figures and they'd be more prone to go after the civilian
                    politicians who were not very powerful at that time or how did that work?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, we had some able political officers - Lowell Kilday, Lou Bolden,
                    Bob Bentley. Bob Bentley knew practically everybody in town. They got around and
                    met both the military and political types. I thought it was a very effective
                    embassy. Tuthill always encouraged people to come up with new ideas. He loved
                    dissent and he would bawl people out if they didn't dissent from him. He was
                    always thinking in different terms. He created an embassy that looked at issues
                    differently. He once - I may have mentioned this to you in the last session -
                    told me to draft an airgram on what I thought the ideal embassy would look like.
                    I did one which essentially abolished all sections and organized it along
                    functional lines. He was always thinking of new ideas and new concepts and that
                    cascaded all the way down in the embassy.</p>
                <p>Q: What was our prime message? There is the normal reporting on political
                    developments which in a way is passive, but that's the observer role. Being the
                    United States, we were an activist country and we were trying to influence
                    events. What were the main things we were trying to encourage with respective to
                    the political scene?</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>BARLUCCI: The main objective was to move them toward a fully functioning
                    democracy and get the military to do what they said they were going to do-hold
                    elections, respect those elections, make sure that there was freedom for the
                    press, freedom of association, all the things that constitute a democratic
                    system. We kept nudging them in that direction and by the nature of our
                    contacts, which were broad and included the opposition, we demonstrated that we
                    wanted a free and open society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well was this message received by the military people,
                        nojust at the top but also at various levels?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Some accepted it. Some thought it was interference in internal affairs.
                    We would get criticized, but I think we had the desired effect.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of the military, the people who came into power, not
                    just at the top but at various levels you were dealing with? Were they sort of a
                    narrow, traditional type military or did they have broader interests?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I would say most of them were traditionalists, although there were
                    clearly exceptions like Carlos Costello Branco. The idea was to try and deal
                    with the people who had a broader sense of the issues and not spend a lot of
                    time on the narrowly focused people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well do you feel you were supported back in Washington
                        by thSecretary of State...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The main interaction we had with Washington was on the TOPSY program.
                    Washington was by and large supportive although they left the tough fighting to
                    Tuthill. In terms of the political message, we had a very good office director,
                    a man named Jack Kubisch, who was extremely able and extremely supportive. I
                    thought we had good backing from Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tuthill left when and how much longer were you in

                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh, I'd have to check the dates.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: He must have left about '68 or so and I was there, I'say, six to eight
                    months or maybe even a year after he left.</p>
                <p>

                        Hodid that translate itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh, it was no secret that Tuthill and I had a very close relationship.
                    My office was right outside his. He essentially administered the embassy through
                    me even though I was a fairly junior officer. Phil Raine was the DCM. Phil was
                    an old political counselor and liked to focus on the political side. So Tuthill
                    increasingly turned a lot of the administrative side over to me. That didn't
                    trouble Phil Raine at all. Bill Belton replaced Phil Rain. He was a slightly
                    different kind of personality - he was a bit more interested in the
                    administrative side. By then I had moved over to the political counselor.
                    Tuthill liked to comment that in eliminating jobs, I eliminated my own, which I
                    did. I felt that the executive officer was no longer necessary in the embassy.
                    The people who were implementing this, namely me, and to a lesser extent Jack
                    Tuthill, were obviously not terribly popular with the rank and file. Although
                    Tuthill himself had such an engaging personality and a wonderfully open style
                    that certainly the junior people in the embassy enjoyed working with him.</p>
                <p>Q: When he left, did you find the system began to close in on you?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It tried to. But I like to think I was able to keep a step ahead of
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would that translate itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, into arguments over policy. The more traditional people mainly
                    those that were in the economic section arguing in favor of the status quo,
                    going slow on nudging the Brazilian government whereas I would argue the case
                    for putting more pressure on the Brazilian government to move towards a fully
                    functioning democracy.</p>
                <p>Q: Were there any issues during either the Tuthill or the post Tuthill period
                    while you were there - events or policy matters - that particularly engaged
                    you?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, other than what I mentioned, there were things that came up from
                    time to time but they were in the normal course of diplomatic activity. No, I'd
                    say when Tuthill was there, by far the vast majority of our time was devoted to
                    the TOPSY exercise which Tuthill viewed, correctly in my judgement, as
                    essentially a political exercise. He didn't view it as a numbers game. He always
                    made the point that TOPSY was the right thing for Brazil but it may not be the
                    right thing for other countries around the world. And of course it was picked up
                    later by the State Department and translated into BALPA [Balance of Payments
                    Program], and applied worldwide. It was never Tuthill's thinking that this was a
                    template to be used around the world.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Q: While you were there-I'm just thinking this was the time when the Soviets
                    moved into Czechoslovakia and all this-was there concern about a growing
                    Communist influence within Brazil?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh, well, yes, certainly. We had to deal with a certain amount of
                    terrorism. One of our military people in Sao Paulo was assassinated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a language student, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes. Assassinated in front of his family and I as political counselor
                    was the one that had to deal with that. There was increasing terrorist activity.
                    There was certainly a lot of left wing activity in the church. This was
                    countered by right wing death squads. I tried to keep in touch as best I could
                    with the left wing elements. I would have some contact with liberal educators,
                    those kinds of people. There was considerable concern about the rebirth of
                    communism.</p>
                <p>Q: When you were talking to what was considered the left wing in Brazilian
                    political society, did you find they had a tendency to blame the United States
                    for what was happening in their country?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Sure. We tried to establish contact with the students. Those were the
                    days - I don't know if they still have them - when you designated a student
                    affairs officer in the embassy. We designated a man named Larry Lazer and he
                    reported to me on student activities. I would meet with student groups. We'd
                    hear their views. Certainly there was a fair degree of anti-Americanism, a
                    feeling that we were responsible for the military government, that we were
                    encouraging the military government, that we were not doing enough to move them
                    to a democratic system.</p>
                <p>Q: In a way, it's difficult to counter by telling them what you're trying to do
                    because that alienates you to the powers that be. Was this...?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: You tell them that you favor democracy but then they'd point to all the
                    shortcomings in the process and that was a little hard to defend.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any effort to get to the more violent left wing elements there or
                    were they out of bounds?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: There was no effort to get to them. Their monitoring was left up to the
                    agency.</p>
                <p>Q: Obviously this is an unclassified interview, but how effective did you feel
                    that you were supported and informed by the agency while you were political
                    counselor?</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I had very good relations with the agency which may have been one
                    reason why I was accepted when I finally went into the agency as Deputy
                    Director. I always enjoyed good relations with the agency. I worked with them on
                    meeting with some of the dissident groups. They kept me informed on their
                    activities. I never asked to know their sources, I didn't need that. But I got
                    all their reports and included them in my staff meetings. I thought it was a
                    very cordial relationship.</p>
                <p>Q: Sometimes as I do these interviews I find that the agency work and the
                    political work are on parallel tracks that never meet or mutually support each
                    other, particularly the political section doesn't get the information that's
                    going to the agency. It goes into the agency and may come back but there isn't
                    much support.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I never had that sense. I always saw the reports as thewent out. I
                    didn't have a problem.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh, no. The press was very important and we had some exceptional people
                    in USIA. John Mowinckel was head of USIA and he was excellent. We talked to the
                    press and Tuthill met quite frequently with the editors. Roberto Marinho and
                    Tuthill were good friends. The Brazilian press was very influential.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they, could they lock horns with the military from
                        time ttime as far as policy goes or did they tread a very careful path?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: They would criticize the government but they were circumspect in their
                    criticism. They would take positions which were not necessarily supportive of
                    what the government was doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find our Congress at this time? Was Brazil
                        ofCongress's radar or did it intrude as far as what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I don't think Brazil was the focus of attention. We hasome CODELs
                    [congressional delegations]. I remember Rooney came down.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: He came down and spent something like three days in Brazil. I think he
                    got off the ship once to call on the ambassador and that was all. His other
                    activities were rather well known.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: We'd get the odd congressman but it wasn't on the beatepath at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you feel at all, was it reflected at all, about Vietnam. This is sort of
                    the height of our engagement in Vietnam and the opposition movement in the
                    United States. Youth was protesting and all that. I was wondering if that
                    translated itself into your context.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: No, there wasn't a lot of activity or concern in Brazil about Vietnam.
                    It was not a big issue. A bigger issue was trying to stabilize the Dominican
                    Republic [DR] in the wake of our intervention there. In fact, the head of the
                    MAAG, General Linville, had been the leader of the military forces that went
                    into the DR. Ellsworth Bunker was conducting his negotiations in the DR and
                    Brazil was a very important player in those negotiations.</p>

                <p>CARLUCCI: We eventually did it.</p>

                <p>CARLUCCI: People say military interventions don't work. This is an example of one
                    that did work. We established a functioning democracy in the DR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else you think we should discuss about

                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: No, I think we've covered it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left what in early '69 or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes, I think it probably would have been about January or February of
                    '69. I'd received an assignment to go to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of
                    Technology].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So did you go to MIT?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It would have been late '68 maybe. No, I didn't. I got sidetracked. Don
                    Rumsfeld, an old college friend, had been named Director of OEO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OEO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Office of Economic Opportunity. Don was an old friend. He was a
                    congressman who had visited us in Brazil. We had stayed close since our college
                    days. He asked me to come over and see him and talked me into becoming assistant
                    director of OEO and head of the Community Action Program about which I knew
                    absolutely nothing. So, I never did get to MIT. It must have been '68 now that I
                    think of it because I became Director of OEO in '69.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in OEO from when to when. You say you started in
                        '69?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It must have been late '68 and '69 that I was in OEO. I started out as
                    assistant director. Rumsfeld was there about a year. I must have gotten there
                    about March of '68.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '69?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: No, Rumsfeld left in early '69 and I succeeded him in early '69. That
                    was an absolutely fascinating period in OEO. The program had been created by
                    Lyndon Johnson to eliminate poverty but it was hated by the Republicans. The
                    Nixon administration came in disliking OEO intensely and I could never
                    understand why Don took the job.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because he was a Republican?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: A conservative Republican. The first thing we were faced with was an
                    amendment by Congressmen Edith Green and Al Quie which would have essentially
                    turned OEO over to the states. Without much support from the administration,
                    indeed maybe even opposition, I could never tell, Don single handedly lobbied
                    and defeated that amendment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is still during the Johnson administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: No, it was Nixon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Nixon administration. Came in in '69.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, it would have been '69 then. I was right earlier on then. I went
                    into OEO probably when the Nixon administration had been in office three or four
                    months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So were talking about March, April, something like that,
                        '69.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes, '69. Then I must have become director in '70. I guess it was '70
                    because I was only Director about eight months. Don did save the agency but he
                    gave instructions to me to make sure that the Community Action Program began to
                    move toward cooperation with governors and mayors. It had been a very
                    confrontational program. When we moved into OEO, there were pictures of Che
                    Guevara on the wall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Guevara being the revolutionary from Argentina...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: He was the idol of a lot of people at OEO. This was a very
                    confrontation oriented organization. We used to have constant demonstrations. I
                    would be locked in rooms, we'd have screaming people in the halls. You'd go out
                    and meet with a community action agency and they would pin your back against the
                    wall. I can remember one confrontation I had out in Oakland. Somebody, I think
                    the Director of the Community Action Agency there, said where did I come from
                    and I said, “Well, I was a Foreign Service officer.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Christ, and I thought the President said he was gointo appoint
                    capable people to these jobs.”</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>So I set about to change the staff structure. I also set about to close down some
                    of the more controversial Community Action Agencies. There was one in
                    Minneapolis that I shut down. I shut down the one in Sacramento. I had quite a
                    tussle with the Mayor out there. Governor Reagan got involved. It was a
                    difficult but very educational period. I can remember deciding to cut back on
                    the Community Action Agency up in my hometown of Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. I
                    was called on the carpet by my congressman, Dan Flood, who was also Chairman of
                    the OEO Appropriations Committee. He was quite a character - later pleaded nolo
                    contendere to charges of bribery. I will never forget the conversation. I said,
                    “Congressman, we just have to cut this one because I'm closing others down and
                    cutting back on any number of them. It's a matter of principle.”</p>
                <p>He looked me and said, “Young man, there comes a time in everyone'life when you
                    must learn to rise above principle.”</p>
                <p>We faced those kinds of complications. Of course, the biggest problem that I
                    faced, I inherited from Don when I became director. OEO contained within it the
                    Legal Services Program which was the most confrontational of all the programs.
                    Lawyers who got involved in haircut suits and challenging the federal...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about people whose hair was too long and
                        thewere being fired...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes. They would do some good things like defend tenants, but some of
                    them were very confrontation-oriented and used Legal Services as a program to
                    change society. Well, that infuriated the traditional politicians. But the
                    program was supported by the ABA, by the organized Bar. It was headed by a
                    Harvard trade lawyer who was rather close to the more radical elements, a man
                    named Terry Lenzner, who today runs a kind of a detective agency. Don had become
                    dissatisfied with Terry Lenzner. When Don asked me to succeed him as director, I
                    said, “Well, there are two things you have to do, Don, before I take over. You
                    have to fire Terry Lenzner, which you intend to do anyway. And you have to
                    assure me that Governor Reagan, the governor of California, will sign the grant
                    to California Rural Legal Assistance,” which was the premier legal services
                    program in California, solidly supported by the ABA. But it also defended the
                    grape pickers in the NAPA Valley. The grape growers were Ronald Reagan's primary
                    source of political opposition so Ronald Reagan hated the program. It was a very
                    confrontational program headed by Cruz Reynoso, who is now a judge in the
                    California court system.</p>
                <p>Don said, “I've issued the grant and Ronald Reagan won't veto it.” Let me
                    explain. The OEO director had authority to issue grants, governors could veto
                    those grants but then the OEO director had an override. This had been used very
                    sparingly, I think only once, certainly not with a governor like Ronald
                    Reagan.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>So, I said, “Okay, fine, Don,” and Don left. The next day, I got the flu, and was
                    named director the following day. The day after that, Ronald Reagan vetoed the
                    grant. He not only vetoed the grant, he called Richard Nixon and said, “Don't
                    let Carlucci override the veto.” About that time, Alan Cranston called me up,
                    senator from California who was chairman of the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Democratic senator.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Democratic senator-liberal democratic senator-who was Chairman of the
                    committee that was going to confirm me. He called me in and he said, “Frank,
                    unless you override that veto, you're not going to get confirmed.” So I had
                    Richard Nixon, through John Ehrlichman telling me don't you dare override the
                    veto and I had Alan Cranston telling me if I didn't override the veto, I wasn't
                    going to be confirmed. That started quite a saga. John Mitchell got involved. I
                    ended up one night over the Justice Department with Pat Gray and we got into a
                    dialogue with Ronald Reagan, but that broke down. He and I ended up calling each
                    other names in public. I told him that he had been deceitful or something like
                    that and he countered with some criticism of me, I can't remember what it was.
                    So the whole thing was off to a very rocky start. Ronald Reagan produced
                    something like 500 pages of charges against the program - all the alleged
                    wrongdoings he could find. I took those charges and appointed a three judge
                    commission, two Republicans and a Democrat - state supreme court judges - one
                    had been former Chief Justice - to look into the charges. They conducted for
                    five or six months a road show up and down the state of California. When they
                    produced their report, it essentially said that none of the charges was
                    accurate. I took the report and dove underground. The program, CLRA [California
                    Legal Rural Assistance], instantly sued me under the Freedom of Information Act
                    to get the report. But I called Ronald Reagan on the phone and said, “Governor,
                    I have this report. You and I ought to sit down.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, okay, come our here.” So clandestinely I went out tSacramento and
                    sat down alone with Ronald Reagan.</p>
                <p>I said, “This report is going to be very critical. Three Supreme Court justices,
                    two Republicans, that say not one of your charges can be substantiated. There's
                    going to be a lot of criticism. Now I will cover you on the criticism. I will
                    also give you your own program. I'll give you a separate grant for the
                    California State Legal Services Program. In return for doing these two things, I
                    want the longest grant in CLRA history. I want a two year grant.”</p>
                <p>We had something like a three day dialogue basically between me and Ed Meese in
                    which at one point my general counsel threatened Ed Meese with leveling
                    Sacramento. The White House was calling constantly saying what the hell am I
                    doing? Why don't I cave? Eventually Ronald Reagan agreed to give the grant.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>That followed a stormy congressional hearing where I was called on the carpet for
                    something like 13 hours with Congress screaming at me. Although the liberal
                    democrats constantly asked why did I do this, I simply said, “Look, they've got
                    the longest grant in their history.” Don't worry about my rhetoric, they got the
                    grant.” At the end of that hearing, Ronald Reagan called me personally and
                    thanked me.</p>
                <p>Q: Why don't we stop at this point and put the end here. We're talking about the
                    Office of Economic Opportunity. You've talked about how you got into it and
                    you've talked about your confrontation with Ronald Reagan over particularly the
                    grape growers thing. But we haven't really talked about what the program was
                    doing, the general policy for the historian to understand what was going on and
                    you've mentioned closing down some of the more controversial, confrontational
                    Legal Assistance Offices and I'd like to talk more about how those were judged.
                    How you were sorting apples from oranges in order to keep this program going
                    during the Nixon administration and how a bureaucrat who wants to get something
                    done survives in a highly charged political atmosphere, particularly under the
                    Nixon administration.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: With difficulty. ***</p>
                <p>Q: Today is the 22nd of December, 1997. Frank, you heard the questions. Let's
                    talk first about what the Office of Economic Opportunity was.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the goal of it as you saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It was originally a Lyndon Johnson great society program, the goal
                    being to eliminate poverty which was to say the least a very optimistic goal.
                    The first director of the office was Sarge Shriver. Then the Nixon
                    administration came in and Don Rumsfeld took over. By then the program had been
                    pretty fully developed. Some would say overdeveloped. The Community Action
                    Program was a very large program. Legal Services was extraordinarily active. You
                    had VISTA [Volunteers in Service to America]. You also had a health program. It
                    was a fairly substantial agency. There was no question that the Nixon
                    administration took a decidedly different view of OEO than the Kennedy/Johnson
                    administration and in the end decided to close it. When Rumsfeld first came in
                    there was a congressional offensive led by Congresswoman Edith Green and
                    Congressman Al Quie to put constraints on OEO, to force OEO to make all its
                    grants through state and local government. Don Rumsfeld fought that off. I don't
                    know how he managed his relationship with the White house while doing that. It
                    struck me as some trick, but he was successful. When Don left to go to the White
                    House as a counselor to the President, I was asked to replace as director, which
                    I did.</p>

                    <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the atmosphere that you found within the office?
                        Was iconfrontational to the Nixon administration or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh, yes. When we took over-perhaps it's bescharacterized by saying
                    there pictures of Che Guevara on the wall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the revolutionary hero of Communist Cuba.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It was certainly a radically oriented agency with very altruistic
                    goals. We were going to help the poor and we were going to do that by empowering
                    them politically. That was the theory. Particularly the theory of legal
                    services. You could use the law to empower the people. Our view of it was
                    somewhat different. Our view was that it should be a service delivery
                    organization with some multiplier effect. The Community Action Agency should not
                    be confrontational. Their job was not to confront state and local government but
                    to work with state and local government to establish a harmonious relationship
                    to make sure the funds were allocated in as efficient a manner as possible. That
                    is to say the funds between state and local government and the Community Action
                    Agencies. The lawyers should not be bringing haircut suits or confronting the
                    federal government on major programs, bringing class action suits to change
                    society but should be dealing with the individual needs of poor citizens. In the
                    end we came to the conclusion that the lawyers needed to be part of an
                    independent legal services corporation. I had drafted the statute to create the
                    Independent Legal Services Program. That's how it came into being.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find as you peeled below the surface that the Nixon administration,
                    particularly in social affairs, was really much more liberal than it was given
                    credit for?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I don't think there was any question. You had revenusharing, HR1 [House
                    Reduction One].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: HR1 being the...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The social security amendment that provided benefits to the disabled.
                    The largest single bill, I think domestic bill, certainly up to that time. Nixon
                    signed. It created an enormous entitlement program for the disabled. Nixon
                    supported the Peace Corps. There were a number of programs in the domestic area.
                    When I later went to HEW [Department of Health, Education, and Welfare], we
                    developed a national health insurance proposal which the Nixon administration
                    basically encouraged. It didn't see the light of day until the Ford
                    administration. We also worked on welfare reform, a negative income tax program,
                    all ideas that today would be regarded today as liberal.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Q: How did you deal with the lawyers, particularly the younger lawyers who were
                    coming out of the sixties thing? Did you find yourself dealing with a
                    revolutionary situation or...?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: To some extent. You had to try and get good supervision over them. We
                    fired the then director of Legal Services - I say Rumsfeld did - and I brought
                    in a new director named Fred Speaker who related very well to the lawyers. He'd
                    been a former attorney general of Pennsylvania, and had a very engaging
                    personality. He seemed to be able to manage the lawyers yet had a philosophy
                    that was consistent control. So, it gradually came under control. We tangled
                    with some people. One of the more difficult people for me to deal with was Spiro
                    Agnew at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Vice President.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: And Pat Buchanan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the President's speech writer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: He got involved in policy issues. He also spent a lot of time with
                    Agnew and wrote some of Agnew's speeches. They hated the Legal Services Program.
                    They kept calling me and telling me to kill it, to kill this or kill that. I
                    finally, just gave up trying to deal with them. The best account of the attitude
                    towards these kind of programs is in Len Garment's book. Len Garment has written
                    a book called Crazy Rhythm. You asked earlier how I survived. I survived by
                    finding friends wherever I could. Len Garment was a friend in court.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his position in the White House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: He was an assistant to the President. He was a senior assistant. But
                    he'd been Nixon's law partner and was very close to him personally. He had a
                    different view than the rest of the White House staff. He certainly had a
                    different view than John Mitchell. He was much more supportive of programs like
                    Legal Services. Len was very helpful during that. He was also very engaged in
                    civil rights initiatives. I was engaged in some of that as well. We worked
                    together on Indian affairs. In his book he recounts how he and I negotiated the
                    Indians out of the Bureau of Indian Affairs when they were about to immolate
                    themselves on election eve in 1972. People forget this. On election eve, a group
                    of Indians...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about American Indians.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: American Indians occupied the BIA [Bureau of Indian Affairs] and
                    threatened to blow themselves up. Len became the negotiator and he asked for me
                    to work with him on it and the two of us-successfully I might say-negotiated
                    them out. But right after we negotiated them out, we went in and looked and
                    there were Molotov cocktails all over the building so they had been indeed
                    serious about blowing themselves up. These were the same Indians, that later got
                    - some of them, the leadership - involved in Wounded Knee.</p>
                <p>Q: The confrontation with the FBI or state or the authorities anyway and someone
                    was killed.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Leonard was helpful and of course Don Rumsfeld was helpful when he went
                    back to the White House. There were others. Bob Finch was in the White House. He
                    tried to be helpful but he didn't carry a lot of weight. I developed working
                    relationships with people like Ken Cole and to some extent with John
                    Ehrlichman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Congress? Did you have both friends and enemies
                        iCongress or was it more a matter between you and the White House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: No, the people who were sympathetic to the program tended to be on the
                    liberal side. The one I worked with most on Legal Services was Fritz Mondale and
                    he and I became-I don't want to say friends, but we certainly grew I think to
                    respect each other and have been associates every since then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was at that time a senator from Minnesota, later
                        VicPresident.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Alan Cranston was on my committee, too. Teddy Kennedy was but he tended
                    to be a little more confrontational. I could work behind the scenes with Mondale
                    and to some extent with Alan Cranston but it was harder working with Kennedy. On
                    the Republican side, the principal person I worked with was Jake Javits, who, of
                    course, was brilliant and highly effective, but far too liberal for the White
                    House's tastes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that you got the Legal Services into
                        corporation. What was the rationale behind that and how did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I think the Nixon administration finally concluded that Legal Services
                    was too hot a potato for them to handle and they could be insulated if they
                    created an independent Legal Services Corporation. I'm not sure where the idea
                    arose. It was either John Mitchell or Don Rumsfeld who suggested it to me and I
                    said that's a good idea and I'll do it. I think it came to me from Don. Don said
                    that he'd talked to John Mitchell about it.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes, Mitchell was Attorney General at the time. John Mitchell and I had
                    had a bit of a falling out. We had certainly differed on the handling of the
                    Ronald Reagan problem and I had...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is grapes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: This is in California Rural Legal Assistance. I finally told John
                    Mitchell I didn't work for him. I wasn't going to take his orders any more. If
                    he wanted to talk to me, he had to go through Richard Nixon. I think John
                    Mitchell discovered that the Legal Services Program was a bit of a third rail
                    and that he was just as happy to get it out from under the administration. So
                    that's how the independent corporation was created.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other particular issues with... You were at
                        thOffice of Economic Opportunity from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh it wasn't long. It was only about a year or a year and a half in 69
                    to 70 or 71. I basically had time to work through the CLRA issue, set up an
                    Independent Legal Services Program, and to get a reasonable amount of funding to
                    the Community Action Program. VISTA was then moved out and combined with the
                    Peace Corps in something called ACTION. Joe Blanchard became the director of
                    that. So all these things took place in a very short period of time. But I'd
                    only been there about a year when George Shultz called me and asked me to come
                    over to OMB.</p>
                <p>Q: This is Office of Budget and Management, Management and Budget I mean. What
                    was your impression of the inroads that were being made by Federal action
                    dealing with poverty at that point and time?</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: My reaction was that some good was being done, no question. Whether it
                    was cost effective was a very different issue. These programs tended to be very
                    expensive. I think their major success was to provide upward mobility for the
                    people who were poverty stricken and in the low income brackets. An awful lot of
                    the leadership came up through these programs, including people who became
                    subsequently members of Congress. I can remember one time I was testifying
                    before the Congress and the questioning came down near the end and one of the
                    more junior members said, “Mr. Carlucci, you may not remember me but I was
                    Executive Director of the Community Action Agency in Dade County Florida. That
                    was the agency you closed down.” I found myself in some trouble right away. A
                    number of political leaders did have their early years, their formative years,
                    in the poverty program so I think in that sense it made a contribution. There
                    was no question that Legal Services did bring about some changes in the way
                    people were able to relate to government programs. On the other hand, did they
                    go too far? Sure, they went too far on occasion. So all in all, I think it made
                    a contribution. Did it eliminate poverty? Obviously not. Can it eliminate
                    poverty? No, I don't think so. I think by far, the engine to eliminate poverty
                    has to be our dynamic private sector. These programs can fulfill a niche, but
                    it's very much the market that will determine the poverty level.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well he was Secretary of Labor when I first went into OEO. As Director
                    of Community Action, I related quite a bit to the Department of Labor because we
                    originally had the Job Corps under us. That was moved over to Labor. So we had
                    to handle it, I had a lot of dealings with the Department of Labor. We came to
                    know both Larry Silberman and George Shultz.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have the feeling that you were known as a no-nonsense, non-political,
                    Mr. Fix-it or somebody who could take care of things without getting too
                    political about them?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, to answer that would be self-serving.</p>

                <p>CARLUCCI: I think it speaks for itself that I was put in some very difficult
                    situations. When George asked me to come over and be the number three person in
                    OMB, he said I was going to replace Arnie Webber. Arnie Webber was a brilliant
                    man and had a very tough style. And he said, “Frank, Arnie has more or less worn
                    out his welcome and he's gone about as far as he can. We want somebody with a
                    less confrontational style.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So did you deliberately keep this in mind when you were
                        dointhis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I just did what I thought I had to do. Certainly I've had the
                    opportunity to work for a number of outstanding people like Rumsfeld, Shultz,
                    Weinberger. All three of them sort of picked me up and moved me along in my
                    career. Obviously I was able to contribute in some way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this office, what was George Shultz's operation style
                        woulyou say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: George was a very good manager. He tended to concentrate on policy. He
                    delegated the budget to Cap Weinberger, the number two and he delegated the
                    management to me, number three, but he was very interested in management of
                    government. In fact, that's when OMB first developed a managerial role. They
                    never had one up 'til then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Under George.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Uh huh. George would listen. He'd have faith in his subordinates. He
                    was willing to delegate. He was willing to make hard decisions. Later on when I
                    became National Security Advisor and George was Secretary of State, we'd differ
                    on occasion. I think that George would get very stubborn or very morose, but he
                    was always analytical. I think George liked to intellectualize a problem. He was
                    tough. I don't mean in a mean spirited way. He would think through the issues
                    before he'd make a decision. He'd never make snap judgements and he would listen
                    to his subordinates. So he was a very good manager. I'm sure that your
                    colleagues in the State Department found that to be the case when he was
                    Secretary of State; he was very good to work with.</p>
                <p>Q: I never worked for him, but for the people I've interviewed, George Shultz
                    really, when you add up all the pluses and minuses, I think comes out as the
                    most effective Secretary of State we've had in the span since Marshall and
                    Acheson.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, certainly the results speak for themselves. The way we were able
                    to wind down the Cold War and pursue a strategy which was basically laid out by
                    George about mid-term of the Reagan administration. He pursued it with dogged
                    determination. Some of the rest of us had a role to play. But I'll give to
                    George the credit for the strategic rationale of the whole thing.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your... You said you had the management portfolio from about '70 to
                    '72. Where did you see your priorities and problems that you...?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, you had crises. We had a place like the Office of Minority
                    Business Enterprise in the Department of Commerce that was chaotic. I had to
                    send my own team in to run it. I remember my first assignment was - I think I'd
                    been in the job one day and John Ehrlichman called me after his morning staff
                    meeting and said, “Frank, I want you to go over and tell John Mitchell he
                    doesn't know how to manage worth a damn and the President is very dissatisfied
                    with the way he is running his department.”</p>
                <p>So I screwed up my courage and went over and gave that message, in slightly more
                    diplomatic terms, to John Mitchell. He took it with humor and some grace. My job
                    was to see that the departments were well run. We put in various systems to try
                    and do that. Management by Objective systems, which I would say were marginally
                    effective, but they were carried on into the Ford Administration under my
                    successor, Fred Malek, who I think made them far more effective.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you see the OMB being maybe overly intrusive into policy operations?
                    Running things well is one thing, but that can get into the programs and what
                    you're trying to accomplish.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: On the managerial side we didn't see OMB being intrusive enough. We
                    felt the Federal Government was abysmally run because it should be far more
                    efficient and the people should pay far more attention to good management
                    practices. They needed to have objectives that were consistent with the
                    President's objectives and that wasn't always the case. So OMB needed to crack
                    the whip. The policy on the budget issues automatically (I later moved over the
                    budget side.) carried over into policy issues. OMB is in fact the President's
                    policy making instrument - that and the Domestic and National Security Councils.
                    The agencies do not have independent policy making responsibility. The President
                    is the policy maker. The agencies are the implementers. The Cabinet as a group
                    can have an input into policy. I differ very strongly with the theory which a
                    lot of people hold that agencies should be independent policy makers or
                    advocates of their constituents. I don't think they should do either. They
                    should be agents of the President since the President after all is the only one
                    who is elected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at the various government departments during this
                        period,where were the better and worse elements would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, it's hard to say. The Defense Department was an entity all to
                    itself. You had to deal separately with the Defense Department. The OMB couldn't
                    treat Defense as it treated any other agency. It was just too big and we had to
                    have a different budget process with Defense than with the other agencies. State
                    Department certainly wasn't looked upon as a very good manager, small department
                    in terms of the budget, but in terms of management, not very well run. Elliott
                    Richardson tried to do some good things over at HEW. He was the first one to put
                    in some real management systems, but that was a big sprawling department. Earl
                    Butz was Secretary of Agriculture. He was probably one of the most cooperative
                    in dealing with the budget issues. Interior is a relatively small department.
                    George Romney was at HUD [Housing and Urban Development]. He was a wonderful
                    man. He was not known as a strong manager. It is very hard to find an agency
                    that you could argue was very well run. I think that's changed now. I think
                    there are some agencies - FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] I think is
                    pretty well run now. I think Defense is now working on it's management systems a
                    lot harder than it was in its earlier days. I don't think there's anybody that
                    can claim the federal government is well-run.</p>
                <p>Q: I think we better stop at this point here. I'll just put at the end of the
                    tape we're talking at your time at the Office of Management and Budget. We've
                    talked about how your general impression of how George Shultz ran things and
                    which departments were in relative terms were better run during the '70-'72
                    period. Next time we might pick up on some of the crises and problems you were
                    picking up and we've just started to talk about when you were on the managerial
                    side. We'll pick up when you were on the budget side.***</p>
                <p>Today is the 20th of January 1998. Frank, we're moving to what diyou do on the
                    budget side of Office of Management?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, I replaced Cap Weinberger when Cap became Director of OMB
                    replacing George Shultz who had moved to the Secretary of the Treasury. In those
                    days, the Director of OMB spent a lot of time as an advisor to the President.
                    The responsibility for putting the budget together was left to the Deputy
                    Director. So Cap before me, and I when I moved into the job, had the basic
                    responsibility of putting the federal budget together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The budget you would have been working on would have been
                        thwhat '93, the '92 budget?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh, no. This was...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean '70...You were there '71 or '72?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, it would have been the '73 - '74 budget because yoare working a
                    couple years ahead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the process in those days as far as the discipline
                        obringing it up? Was there battles royal or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, there are always struggles. We in that budget, I think it was the
                    '74 budget, decided to try and phase out 125 programs. This is always bad news
                    for the Cabinet secretaries. Only one, Elliott Richardson, appealed to the
                    President. Others I can remember dealing with, Earl Butz, and telling him I was
                    going to hit, I think it was the Farmers Home Administration...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Secretary of Agriculture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: He was Secretary of Agriculture. He said, “Well Frank, I will take my
                    medicine as long as you promise me you are going to hit other departments as
                    well.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Earl, I will.” So he marched off and sort of led the parade of people
                    who said they would take their medicine. It was a very tough budget. In those
                    days, Congress was a big spender. If my memory serves me correctly, of the 125
                    programs, we were able to phase out only one. I think it was an Arctic Research
                    Center. The rest of them if anything grew. Those were the days of entitlements.
                    It was also the days when we used the technique of impounding money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what impounding money meant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Even if the Congress had voted, we decided the Executive would not
                    spend it. A line item veto if you will. After we lost 30 straight court cases,
                    we decided that strategy wasn't working very well. This led to the Budget and
                    Impoundment Act of 1974, which in essence forced the executive to spend all the
                    money Congress appropriated or ask for recessions.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find your relations with Congress when you were going after these?
                    Did you maintain cordial relations while going after these pet cows.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It was difficult, although there wasn't a requirement to testify on the
                    hill because the agency heads did that. The director of OMB handled the initial
                    budget presentation press conference but then it was the responsibility of the
                    different Cabinet secretaries to defend the President's budget. So you didn't
                    have to spend a lot of time testifying but you certainly had to spend a lot of
                    time in interagency struggles. Individual congressmen would call you and exert a
                    certain amount of pressure. Generally, the Congress exerts the pressure on the
                    Cabinet departments because they have direct responsibility over those
                    departments and they know are going to be more responsive than OMB. OMB is a
                    tough nut for anybody to crack.</p>
                <p>Q: I don't like ranking systems, but in general, could you - which of the various
                    departments were the more difficult budgets for you all to try to get some
                    handle on?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, the Defense budget was always treated separately. With the other
                    budgets, the departments submitted a budget, OMB reviewed it and gave [it] back
                    to the department as a budgetary target. In the case of Defense which was so
                    large and complex, there was really a concurrent review. I don't know how it's
                    handled today but that continued even when I was Secretary of Defense. Which
                    meant that the OMB people sat in on the Defense Department's own deliberations
                    so when the budget reached OMB it was essentially a joint budget. I would say
                    that process worked fairly well. The hardest budget probably to deal with, I
                    would think, was the HEW where you had all the social programs, the entitlement
                    programs, the congressional favorites. HUD to some extent was the same. The
                    programs where you had entrenched constituencies were the most difficult to deal
                    with.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that the retired community was much of a factor? Now it's become
                    a huge factor, but in those days was the retirement community something you
                    worried about?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, at the time we were in OMB, the Congress passed something called
                    HR 1 which greatly expanded the social security system and disability payments.
                    We had opposed that but the President decided to sign it over OMB's objections.
                    That created a very large entitlement program, specifically the SSI Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: SSI?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Supplemental Security Income Program. That started us down the path. I
                    don't want to get ahead of your story but then Cap and I went over to HEW and
                    had to defend the budget we had to put in. The Congress accused us being
                    insensitive and bad advocates. We tried to phase out such things as the
                    Hill-Burton Hospital Program, reduce the grants for medical students, on the
                    grounds that we were over supplied with hospitals and over supplied with medical
                    specialists. I think history has proved us to be correct.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the veterans' lobby, particularly
                        veterans'hospitals? Was this a particularly difficult thing to deal
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It was a very strong lobby. There's no question. The VA [Veteran's
                    Affairs] is a very large organization. Most people don't realize it. I think all
                    of these groups were difficult to deal with. They all had their vested
                    interests. They all pressed very hard. To a great extent, your ability to manage
                    the process depended on your relationship with the Cabinet secretaries. If they
                    were responsive and the secretaries that we had-Veterans Administration was not
                    a Cabinet department at the time-the people we had to deal with I thought played
                    the game fairly straight.</p>
                <p>Q: We've touched on this before, but did you sense at this time, when Nixon was
                    still the President, a continuing commitment to social programs on the part of
                    the President as opposed to his general persona which was supposed to be Mr.
                    Conservative but yet he was really...?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: He had a commitment to certain kinds of programs. He had a commitment
                    to revenue sharing. He certainly had no commitment toward some of the more
                    traditional social services approaches. Even though we had put the budget
                    together, we really only had one session with the President. We flew up to Camp
                    David. Cap Weinberger, me, George Shultz, John Ehrlichman, Bob Haldeman, I think
                    Ken Cole - I can't remember who else was there. We had a session with the
                    President where I basically presented the outline of the budget. I was astounded
                    when the discussion focused on a small agency, OEO, where I had just come from,
                    and the strength of the President's feeling that OEO had to be phased out.
                    “Change the name, phase it out, this ought to be easy to do.” I said, “Mr.
                    President, it's not going to be easy because we've changed OEO. It now has the
                    support of mayors and governors and they're going to object.” That was brushed
                    aside and I was given instructions to eliminate OEO, which started a whole
                    different saga. I essentially messed that job up.</p>

                <p>CARLUCCI: OEO was the enemy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean this was not a rational calculation. This was
                        personal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Here we were dealing with the space shuttle and all kinds of far larger
                    programs, and we devoted most of the time talking about OEO. I thought it was
                    out of proportion. There's no question there was a very strong emotional feeling
                    on the part of the President. He did not like the great society programs.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>Q: While you are in a meeting like this were you picking up, because you're going
                    to get into it later on I guess, the chemistry between Weinberger and Shultz?
                    Was that apparent at that point?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: That's always been a strained relationship. Yes, I got into the
                    chemistry between Weinberger and Shultz. I can remember one time in George
                    Shultz's office when they were arguing, I intervened and said, “Come on; can't
                    you two guys just cool it for a minute?” I think George Shultz put it rather
                    well when he said that Cap is a position taker and I like to analyze a problem
                    from all angles. Cap did tend to take positions very quickly and defend them as
                    an advocate, as a lawyer, which he is, whereas George was far more analytical
                    and took more time to reach his position but was equally stubborn. So once the
                    two of them dug in - Cap would dig in right away, George would dig in a little
                    later - it was a rock against a hard place. Very difficult to move either of
                    them. When I later became National Security Advisor, the invitation was offered
                    [to me] in a secret meeting with President Reagan - Don Regan was the only other
                    person present. When the President asked me if I'd take the job, I sort of
                    expected that he might say well you've got a Foreign Affairs background or
                    you've done this or that, or you're reasonable competent or something like that.
                    What he said was, “You're the only person I can find that George Shultz and Cap
                    Weinberger can agree on.” I spent a large part of my time mediating between
                    George and Cap. That being said, while they frequently argued, they both had a
                    lot of respect for each other and I have enormous respect for both of them.</p>
                <p>Q: Well there to, they are not lightweights in the intellectual field at all.
                    They are very big heavyweights. So it's not just a personality thing. It's where
                    they're coming from. With the OEO were you able to make any- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>You were saying how you did not succeed in doing what the President wanted on
                    this. I'd just like to get a feel for-I mean here you are with probably the
                    President's hunting dogs on your tail the whole time trying to make sure that
                    you are doing the President's will. How did work out?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: They didn't do that. They trusted me. I proceeded to do my thing. I
                    decided first of all that we needed to get a new director for OEO. The then
                    director, Phil Sanchez, who I had brought in, was a lovely man but he was
                    certainly not the one to phase out the agency. He was a supporter. My first move
                    was to get him named ambassador. I think it was to Nicaragua.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those days a pleasant place to go.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: That created an opening. I needed to find a new Director. I got a
                    recommendation from Don Rumsfeld and I called the man in. He was a lawyer, a
                    very able guy who served a little time in OEO. I told him what the mission was
                    and he almost literally turned green in my office and said, “I don't want to
                    touch that at all.”</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>I thought to myself who in the world am I going to get to come in and just phase
                    out an agency. Nobody is going to want to do that. Then I made a mistake. I
                    thought of Howard Phillips who had been an assistant to me when I was director
                    of OEO and had, as everybody knows, very far right leanings. Howard is still
                    active politically today, very much on the right. I called Howard in and asked
                    him if he would be interested and he leapt at the opportunity. I said, “Howard,
                    let met give you two words of advice. Declare it a victory. Don't declare it a
                    failure. Secondly don't take on the Legal Services Program.” Howard did not pay
                    any attention to that advice and a big mess ensued at OEO. The constituency rose
                    up in arms, the press attacked and the administration [blanched. Eventually, it
                    was phased out or phased into HEW, part of it, but it was done in a very...it
                    was mangled. In the end we had to move Howard Phillips out and bring in Dwight
                    Ink who was a very experienced bureaucratic administrator, even-tempered person,
                    well known in administration circles. Dwight calmed things down and eventually
                    it turned out all right. But I regret the misery I put a lot of people
                    through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, this is sort of a lesson that somebody with
                        ratheextreme views dealing with a bureaucracy doesn't work very well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It certainly didn't in this case.</p>
                <p>Q: Revenue sharing. Here you are as part of a bureaucracy, federal bureaucracy,
                    revenue sharing means that you going to pass money that had control over down to
                    the states. I would think just looking at a bureaucracy as such, there would be
                    a great deal of reluctance on the part of letting those people out beyond
                    the...</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI. There was. But everybody knew that the President was very committed to
                    revenue sharing. In fact, if you look at the Nixon administration's record of
                    domestic programs, you had revenue sharing; you had the development of a
                    national health insurance proposal; you had development of a welfare reform
                    proposal. It was quite a progressive record devoting resources and energy to the
                    social services. Revenue sharing was very simple. It just had to be developed by
                    OMB and put into the system, you put in a given amount of money and it was
                    automatic.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your experience looking at it from when you started this and when you
                    went to look at this later from different perspectives. How did revenue sharing
                    work?</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The idea of course was that you give more responsibility to the states.
                    I think in concept it was a good idea. On the other hand, the states were not
                    known for managing their resources that well. Of course, neither was the federal
                    government. The question of who is the least inefficient is one way of putting
                    it. I think there's no question that we had centralized too much spending
                    authority in the federal government. The federal government was into all kinds
                    of areas that could be better handled by government closer to the people. We
                    needed to push things down. When I got over to HEW, I tried to decentralize HEW
                    at least put the authority in the hands of the regional directors and allow some
                    co-mingling of funds. I'd visit a welfare family and find that they were
                    receiving funds from 15 different programs, all with their own set of rules and
                    regulations and all with their own social workers. Well that was not only
                    wasteful, it was confusing. So I advocated something called the Allied Services
                    Act which would allow funds to be transferred from one program to another by
                    people on the ground. That was soundly rejected in Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The Congress wanted to control the expenditure of funds. Very simple.
                    They wanted to decide the kinds of grants schools would get from Washington and
                    not have them in the hands of some local administrator.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I think it was about 600 people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to set up something to monitor the revenue

                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It was too early in the process for us to have any kind oeffective
                    evaluation. So no, we didn't try.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You moved out of OMB to HEW. When did you go there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: You may recall when Nixon was reelected he called hientire Cabinet in
                    and fired them.</p>

                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: People were looking for other opportunities. I can recall somebody,
                    perhaps whether it was Bill Rogers, talked to me about becoming Under Secretary
                    of State for Administration. I was contemplating that when the President called
                    Cap Weinberger and asked him to be Secretary of HEW. Cap then asked me if I'd go
                    with him as his Under Secretary - number two person. In those days, it was
                    called Under Secretary. You may recall that those were the days when John
                    Ehrlichman came up with the idea of Counselors to the President. Certain Cabinet
                    departments were more important than others and their secretaries would be a
                    counselor to the President. Departments were to be clustered. So Cap started off
                    as the head of the Human Services Cluster as a counselor to the President, which
                    meant that de facto at the outset I was running HEW. That system broke down and
                    Cap then came over to HEW as opposed to staying in the White House and we worked
                    together as a team. I'd like to think it was an effective team.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the word in the corridors of government of why President Nixon fired
                    everybody and wanted to start again? Was it just unhappiness or just...?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I can't recall what the speculation was. My own view is that it was a
                    fairly typical Nixon move. He liked to startle people. He liked to shake things
                    up. He liked to be dramatic. He liked to be tough. It fulfilled all those
                    requirements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at HEW until you went to Portugal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this would be what '73 to ...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I went to Portugal in January of '75 so in the '73 and '7area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To be number two in HEW is sort of an awesome task. It's
                        such huge sprawling organization.</hi>

                <p>CARLUCCI: It was.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you give me a little tour of the horizon as you saw it when you arrived.
                    Where were the places you could almost leave alone and where were the problems
                    as far as the responsibility of HEW. This would be '73.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The biggest initial job was implementing the SSI Program that I
                    mentioned earlier. That required all kinds of determinations on who was eligible
                    for benefits and who was not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was basically a type of welfare isn't it? I mean,
                        we'd calit welfare?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes. For the disabled. We had a lot of requirements in the social
                    services area. Once again, we were trying to bring the programs together because
                    we had such diversity. I can't remember how many programs HEW administered. Well
                    over 100 and each with their own requirements and laws. In the education area we
                    had to deal with the higher education amendments which I basically took on and
                    negotiated with the Congress. I brought about some, I felt, constructive changes
                    in higher education. In the health area our major effort was to get some focus
                    into the health activities of HEW. Once again, we were all over the lot. I
                    succeeded in combining the job of Surgeon General with the job of Assistant
                    Secretary for Health. We put first of all, Dr. Edwards, Charlie Edwards, in the
                    job and then he was succeeded by Dr. Ted Cooper, a marvelous man who later
                    become CEO [chief executive officer] of Upjohn. We were able to bring the health
                    activities under one roof. We of course had the FDA [Food and Drug
                    Administration]; and we had Virginia Knauer, Special Assistant to the President
                    for Consumer Affairs. We had a very large Consumer Affairs office, almost as
                    large as the State Department; a lot of the health activities overseas. Then you
                    had civil rights. We had Title Nine passed at the time and we had to develop
                    regulations for it. We were still implementing Title Six at the universities, a
                    very controversial area. There was a lot to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Title Six? CARLUCCI: Civil Rights Act.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Q: Civil Rights Act. What was the status as far as it impacted on your work of
                    the Civil Rights community? What were your major problems-issues?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The Civil Rights community was of course pushing very hard for rigid
                    goals and timetables or quotas. Most of our focus was on the universities that
                    received federal money and obliging the universities to come up with goals and
                    timetables. We took the goals and timetables approach as opposed to the quotas
                    approach although one could argue whether that's a distinction without a
                    difference. Most of the flack came from the other side. The university
                    administrators would claim we were distorting the educational process, that we
                    were degrading education by moving too fast. It was always a balance between
                    satisfying the needs of the law and the civil rights and at the same time making
                    sure that we didn't go the way of reverse discrimination. We had the DeFunis
                    case at the time.</p>

                <p>CARLUCCI: Reverse discrimination case where an [applicant to the University of
                    Washington law school] sued for reverse discrimination and, I believe, got some
                    redress. [The lower court ordered him admitted] My memory is a little hazy on
                    it. [On appeal, the case went all the way to the Supreme Court, which said in
                    April 1974 that since DeFunis was close to graduation the case was moot]</p>
                <p>Q: Was it that the idea of higher education was essentially to open up the
                    educational process to more minorities, particularly blacks - African
                    Americans?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: That was the idea and it was to be done by statistical analysis at the
                    universities to make sure something was happening. That's entirely appropriate
                    because there was no question there was a lot of discrimination. We worked hard
                    to eliminate that discrimination but it was necessary to strike a balance.</p>

                <p>CARLUCCI: That's right. In some cases there was certainly discrimination.
                    Something needed to be done. No question. It was a question of how fast we could
                    do it without major disruption to our educational system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Congress see this issue? They had passed the law
                        but ionce you get into implementation it does not always sit too well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The Congress was basically on the liberal side. They kept pushing us to
                    move faster on imposing goals and timetables on universities.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find the more prestigious universities-the California system, the
                    Ivy League, Chicago and some of that? Were they ahead of the game, behind or
                    were they...?</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, it's a little hard. So many years have passed for me to recall
                    individual cases. My general recollection was that you couldn't...that there
                    were faults in almost every system-all the universities. But our focus was
                    mainly on the Southern universities. There's no question that- (end of tape)Q:
                    Did Cap Weinberger have any particular areas where he focused on and left you of
                    the various things like education, health...?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: He focused a lot on the National Health Insurance Proposal. He became
                    very deeply involved in that. He also focused a lot on the Welfare Reform
                    Proposal.We used the Milton Friedman model, essentially a negative income tax
                    with a work requirement. The secretary should focus on the big issues and leave
                    the day to day management to the deputy secretary. But sometimes he would get
                    involved in some of the details. It was inevitable. I can recount a rather
                    humorous story. Head Start was a federally funded program for preschool
                    schooling for children. It's generally regarded as a successfully program, very
                    much the favorite of the local communities. Very much the favorite of the
                    Congress. My staff came to me one day and said they had a very good program in
                    Georgia but the program had just been vetoed by then Governor of Georgia, Jimmy
                    Carter, on the grounds that it's planning districts did not conform to the
                    state's planning districts. They said, “We have to get the Secretary to override
                    the governor's veto.” The Secretary had the authority to override a governor's
                    veto.</p>
                <p>I said, “Well have you tried to negotiate it?”</p>
                <p>They said, “Yes. It's hopeless the governor won't back down so yoneed to get the
                    Secretary to override.”</p>
                <p>So I went in to see Cap who had come from state government. He said,“Oh, I don't
                    want to override the governor's veto.”</p>
                <p>So I went back and told the staff he would not do it. Well, they came back when
                    the deadline was nearing and appealed to me once again. So I said, “Alright,
                    I'll go back and see Cap. I went back into see Cap and Cap said, “Let's call the
                    governor.” So Cap and I got on the phone with Jimmy Carter and tried to persuade
                    him that the veto would be damaging to a very good program, essentially minority
                    children, and that surely he didn't want the program to be damaged. He said no,
                    he didn't want the program to be damaged but he had to have his state planning
                    districts conform. With that, we hung up and I said to Cap, “Cap, look, this is
                    an important program. We can't let it go down the drain. Jimmy Carter is a lame
                    duck governor. You'll never hear from him again. You ought to override the
                    veto.” With that, Cap overrode the veto.</p>
                <p>Q: On the health side, was there any type of consensus about what there should
                    be... I assume that everyone even in those days was looking at various systems
                    throughout the world as far as general-health delivery?</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: We started the experiment with HMOs [health maintenance organizations].
                    In fact, I think I was the first person to testify on HMOs, so we did do some
                    innovative things. I think Elliott Richardson actually developed the concept and
                    we picked it up.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there a feeling by the people who were looking at it without political
                    concerns that a national health program-a basic one-would be feasible or
                    not?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh yes. We developed one. It became the victim oFannFox.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain who Fanny Fox was and how that
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, actually Nixon approved the program. It was essentially a
                    national program based on private health insurance. It was greeted with some
                    enthusiasm in the Congress. Senator Kennedy supported it. Wilbur Mills supported
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain who Wilbur Mills is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Wilbur Mills was Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, a very
                    powerful man in Congress at the time. There were a number of Republicans that
                    supported it. With essentially a conservative administration, with some liberal
                    support from the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, prospects looked
                    pretty good. It was opposed by the AMA [American Medical Association] and my
                    friend Joe Broyhill, who was the ranking Republican on Ways and Means at the
                    time. He took the AMA position so the vote was very close in the committee.
                    Well, something like two days before the vote, an episode occurred when Wilbur
                    Mills [was revealed as escorting] Fanny Fox, a local stripper. Apparently she
                    jumped into the Reflecting Pool, [bringing the couple to the attention of
                    police] and that became a big scandal. Wilbur Mills overnight lost his authority
                    in the committee and we lost by, I think, one or two votes. So the National
                    Health Insurance Proposal become the victim of Fanny Fox.</p>
                <p>Q: Such is Washington. Tell me, what was your impression of the power influence
                    of the AMA, American Medical Association, in those days? It's now sort of a
                    shadow of itself.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: In those days it was quite strong.</p>
                <p>Q: '73-'74, Watergate was beginning to bubble. The power of President Nixon was
                    beginning to be challenged on almost a personal basis. Did that intrude at all
                    into your operations?</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh, yes. Every time you'd testify, you'd get castigated by the Congress
                    for being part of the Watergate administration. I can remember at one point, I
                    think I was out in Aspen, it was the week the President had resigned. I called
                    Cap - I was at the Aspen Institute. He and I discussed over the phone whether we
                    should resign or try to maintain some stewardship of the programs. We had grown
                    disenchanted as well. We decided that we would try and hang on a little bit
                    longer. Well something like three or four days later Nixon resigned. So that
                    solved the problem. It became... Sure, it was a burden to carry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it have any effect on programs? Did programs sort of
                        stop-the development...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Quite the opposite. The Congress was pushing to expand social programs.
                    This made it easier for them to expand because they had all the cards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you take advantage of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: No. We were opposed to the expansion of the programs.Remember, I told
                    you we wanted to stop Hill-Burton.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hill-Burton being the...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Hospital construction program. No question today we have too many
                    hospitals as a result of Hill-Burton. Congress wouldn't allow us to phase it out
                    and when you lost your political influence, it was harder to stop these kinds of
                    programs. We tried to stop the growth of entitlements. We didn't like that
                    concept. Now today everybody wants to undo entitlements and they don't know how
                    to do it. But we didn't have the political clout to force our will on the
                    Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you and Cap Weinberger were discussing resigning.
                        Wathis at a personal level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes. I said to Cap, “This is getting pretty bad. I'm not comfortable.
                    Should we resign?” I can't remember what he responded but after we talked it
                    over, we decided no, it was probably best not to resign. We thought we'd wait a
                    little longer to see what happened.</p>
                <p>Q: We're really talking about what was this, September of '74, about that time
                    anyway. But it's August, September of '74 when Nixon resigned and Ford came in.
                    How did that impact on what you all were doing?</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, we both knew Jerry Ford quite well. We were very comfortable with
                    President Ford. He quickly went around to all the Cabinet departments. He came
                    over to HEW. Cap was away so I introduced him. Funny story, because the
                    President was en route and I went into the bathroom in the office next to mine.
                    I don't know why I used that one, but I couldn't get out. There I was, the
                    acting secretary of HEW with the President on his way to HEW and I was pounding
                    on the door of the bathroom trying to get out. Finally I got out. It was a
                    moment of panic. I got down there just in time to greet the President. He came
                    over and talked to the employees and was very reassuring. Jerry Ford was able to
                    pick up immediately because he knew the federal budget very well. He is greatly
                    underrated president. He understood all the HEW programs. When you wanted to
                    appeal your budget mark, you would sit down directly with Jerry Ford and he
                    without notes or assistants would talk about what the program ought to be. He
                    moved in without missing a beat as far as we were concerned.</p>
                <p>Q: When you were working on trying to slow down or stop entitlements and also
                    expansion of hospitals and other things like this, was Ford on the same
                    wavelength?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he have any different thrust that would impact
                        on...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: No. He was very supportive of what we were doing. Wdidn't have to
                    change direction at all.</p>
                <p>Q: Then we come to the time in early '75 when you were off to Portugal which we
                    have already discussed. Was there anything else during this HEW time you think
                    we might want to cover.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh, there was one other thing I spent a lot of time on. I was
                    particularly proud of the results. This will sound a little bit strange coming
                    from someone who just espoused deregulation and decentralization. When I got
                    into HEW I found one thing that I considered absolutely shocking and
                    intolerable. That was the situation in the nursing home industry. People lying
                    in their own excrement. A lot of the nursing homes were fire traps. Fire codes
                    were not being enforced. Regulations were not being enforced. So I took that on
                    as a personal project. I appointed a person as my personal assistant for nursing
                    homes. We cracked down very hard. We cut off funding to the nursing homes that
                    did not live up to sanitary and fire regulations and we put pressure on the
                    states. The most difficult state was my own state, Pennsylvania where the
                    governor refused to move on the nursing home industry, Governor Shapp. I went up
                    and tried to work with him and ended up I guess fighting with him. I finally
                    ended up suing him. We managed to move the state of Pennsylvania by going
                    through the courts. But I spent a lot of time on nursing homes. When I left HEW,
                    the nursing home industry presented me with an award for all that I had done to
                    upgrade the standards of the nursing homes. Actually, the industry liked it
                    because they didn't want these bad actions putting a stain on their good name
                    and reputation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What brought your attention to the nursing homes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oh, just the stories of the kinds of things that wergoing on. I just
                    said this was not tolerable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the government role in the nursing...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The nursing homes received Medicare and Medicaid payments. We cut off
                    the funding in essence. They were heavily dependent on Medicare and
                    Medicaid.</p>
                <p>Q: Why was the Governor of Pennsylvania, and I assume others, opposing you in
                    it?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I suppose it would have meant putting some resources in that area,
                    taking on entrenched lobbies - the nursing home lobby of the individual states.
                    The nursing home owners sometimes carried a lot of political clout. I can't
                    really speculate much further on his motive. All I know is that he was very
                    difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jumping way ahead, you left Portugal in '78 was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '78 what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I came back as deputy director of Central Intelligence. There was a
                    little episode prior to that. You may recall that Dick Moose was under secretary
                    of State for Administration...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the Carter administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Carter administration. He called me while I was in Portugal. He had
                    talked to Cyrus Vance and Cy Vance would like to have me replace him, because
                    Dick was going to become Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. Would
                    I please do that? I said, “Dick, with all due respect, I think you're out of
                    your mind because I came out of a Republican administration. That's a job that
                    brings forth the nominations for ambassador. The White House and Congress aren't
                    going to want a Republican in that job.”</p>
                <p>He said, “No, no. Cy Vance thinks very highly of you.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, okay, but before you do that, go any further, you've got to go
                    over and make sure the President is comfortable.” I obviously knew the President
                    from his days as governor.</p>
                <p>Dick called me back and said, “Oh, Ham Jordan talked to the President and Ham
                    tells us the President likes you and would be very comfortable with you in the
                    job.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Dick, I still think you are going to have problems.”</p>
                <p>Dick called me-nothing out for about two weeks-and Dick called me.He said, “Frank
                    do you know John Brademus?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes, I know John Brademus quite well. I've dealt with hiextensively and
                    he's going to oppose me, Dick.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Yes.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you explain who John Brademus...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: John Brademus was one of the senior democrats in the Congress. A former
                    Rhodes scholar, very bright man, very able man, but highly partisan. John and I
                    are friends to this day. He talked to me about it afterwards. He said, “I hope
                    you understand what my position was...”</p>
                <p>I said, “I understood what you position was-a partisan position anyou're
                    perfectly justified.”</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>So I said, “Dick, I think ought to better drop this.” He dropped it at that
                    point. A little while later another phone call came. I can't remember who it
                    was, I think it was David Aaron or Zbigniew Brzezinski asking me about the
                    Central Intelligence job. To this day I don't know how that came about, but
                    eventually I ended up in the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Stan Turner was the DCI [Deputy Chief of Intelligence]. I came back and
                    visited him and he wanted to divide the intelligence operation into different
                    groups. I would run some groups and he would run others. I told him I wasn't
                    comfortable with that. That I'd been used to working across the board and that
                    it seemed to me more appropriate if he would focus on the intelligence community
                    activities and I would handle the day-to-day management of the CIA. He accepted
                    that. That's essentially the relationship that we used and I think it worked
                    very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself in almost a strange culture or was
                        it onthat you were comfortable with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I was very comfortable with it. I had worked with the agency throughout
                    my Foreign Service career. I was known as someone who was able to work with the
                    agency and I had a very good understanding of their activities on the ground. I
                    saw no conflict between the State Department and the CIA although I spent a
                    large portion of my time trying to prove that I was right. Dave Newsom and I
                    tried all kinds of things to build bridges between the State Department and the
                    CIA including starting courses for ambassadors and [senior] CIA [officers] given
                    at a CIA site.</p>
                <p>Q: This was sort of height of the Cold War, one of the heights. Did you see a
                    different perspective of the Soviet threat from the CIA viewpoint as opposed to
                    what you had been used to in State?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I had come in direct contact with the Soviet threat in Portugal. The
                    communists put out a book called Dossier Carlucci's CIA. It was about an inch
                    thick. It had me doing everything from assassinating Moro the Italian prime
                    minister to killing Lumumba, to instigating the counter revolution in Brazil.
                    They had me responsible for everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Quite flattering.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: So I was very familiar with the kind of tactics they used. I did not
                    have an in depth knowledge of the Soviet military establishment but that came
                    very quickly. I certainly had no illusions on their system or what they were up
                    to or what their goals were.</p>
                <p>Q: Because it became a matter of some controversy eight or nine years later,
                    particularly the Soviet economic system, were you getting any indications there
                    that this was probably the weakest part of the Soviet...?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Bob Gates goes into this quite a bit in his book. There were some
                    papers that said the system may not be as strong as we think it is. I have to
                    say, at least speaking for myself, I was very much focused on military might and
                    it did not occur to me, to be honest, there would be total economic
                    collapse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the estimate of Soviet military capabilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The military. In retrospect, I think our judgements on the size and
                    capabilities of the military were quite accurate. What we did not anticipate was
                    the economic weaknesses that would lead to the collapse.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the intelligence community and the State
                        Departmenanalyses coming into conflict in various areas or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: No. We worked pretty closely with INR. State participated in all the
                    analyses. Sure there were differences, but there were differences with Defense,
                    differences with NSA [National Security Agency]. We'd work those differences
                    out. The problems would arise where you had an ambassador who didn't trust the
                    Agency, took almost a punitive attitude toward the agency, or wanted to see
                    everything the agency did, to know all their contacts. Some didn't want them
                    doing any kind of activity. It was well known that the ambassador to Iran
                    prohibited the Agency from establishing any contact with the opposition when the
                    Shah was in power. Usually Dave Newsom and I were able to work these things
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: David Newsom being the...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Under Secretary of State. A fine man and a long-timfriend of mine. He
                    and I served together in the African Bureau.</p>
                <p>Q: We have an oral history with him, too. I was reading this book The Line of
                    Fire by Admiral Crowe on his time in the Defense Department. He was saying that
                    sometimes the intelligence agencies, including the DIA [Defense Intelligence
                    Agency] tended to come up with the worst case scenarios to cover themselves if
                    anything happened. He found this was difficult to deal with because particularly
                    Congress and others would focus on a worst case scenario and therefore we would
                    tend to take extreme positions. Was this a problem of moderating how the
                    intelligence agencies...?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I think Bill's got a point. I'll give you a concrete example of that.
                    When I was National Security Advisor, we had the Kuwaiti Reflagging Operation.
                    The Iranians were harassing shipping with the Boston Whalers and the Boghammers
                    [i.e., small boats]. We had ships over there to protect U.S. flag vessels. The
                    agency produced a report which essentially said that no military confrontation
                    with Iran would work. They will just escalate their terrorist activities, their
                    harassment activities. Every time you take a step, they'll take a counter step.
                    That report hit the Hill even before the administration had a chance to look at
                    it. It really said the administration policies were all wrong. You should stop
                    the reflagging operation. In the last analysis, the policies worked. The
                    Iranians provoked us and we sank half their Navy in 24 hours. They went back and
                    put their ships in the harbor so we were able to sail with impunity in the Gulf.
                    The CIA analysis in my judgement, in retrospect, was wrong. But it was as you
                    say, the worst case scenario.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>Q: Well, looking at it almost bureaucratically, if things work out all right who
                    cares, if things work out wrong, you can say I told you so. This is the time of
                    Camp David and openings with the Israeli-Arab situation was looking a little
                    better particularly between Egypt and all. Did you find that there were
                    inhibitions or problems in dealing with this because of restrictions on the
                    government for dealing with Europe components? Was this a concern?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Not from a CIA point of view. We had cooperative relationships with
                    intelligence services in Israel and of course in the Arab world. We were able to
                    conduct our normal activities without any particular problems. The saddest
                    moment of my tenure with the CIA was when the embassy in Beirut was blown up.
                    One of our very finest analysts, Bob Ames, was blown up with it. He was a pillar
                    of strength in analyzing Middle East developments, respected throughout the
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about cooperation with France? Did you find a problem
                        theror not or was this...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: [Alexandre] De Marenches was the head of French intelligence. He was a
                    very colorful character. He would come over and we had a cordial relationship
                    but we were never sure what they were doing. The relationships were good. Later
                    when I was in DOD, we had pretty good working relationships in the procurement
                    area and certain other areas. I personally didn't have a lot of frustration
                    dealing with the French. They are different. There's no question. We got what we
                    needed.</p>
                <p>Q: What about our activities in Africa? I mean, you were in Africa and in a way
                    it looks like almost an impossible thing to focus an intelligence agency on,
                    almost chaotic.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: We had listening posts in most of the countries in Africa and we got a
                    lot information. Africa's problem was that it was not on the front burner as far
                    as the policy makers were concerned. We could produce the intelligence, but
                    nobody wanted to pay attention to Africa. There were a lot of other areas. We
                    were very much focused on the Soviet Union. One of the main purposes of having
                    people in stations in Africa was to try and recruit the Soviets who were
                    stationed there. That was the number one priority. That's all changed now. I
                    can't remember what proportion of our resources went to the hard target, but it
                    was a lot. These were also the days when we were trying to cope with the impact
                    of the Freedom of Information Act on the intelligence agencies. I remember we
                    got a Freedom of Information request from the Czech or Polish embassy. We were
                    obliged by law to respond to it. So there were a lot of silly things...</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>Q: Were you comfortable with the efforts to recruit agents? Because one of the
                    complaints I get from my Foreign Service interviews is that they would say, I
                    knew so and so in such and such government and we'd have lunch together and I'd
                    find out things and then I'd find out later on that he was also getting paid by
                    the CIA and they were paying for information that I was getting for a lunch.
                    This may sound facetious but was this a problem or something you were looking
                    at, almost over recruitment?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: There were those kinds of complaints that came up from time to time
                    from Ambassadors but there was no way you could manage that from Washington.
                    That had to be the responsibility of Ambassador and a Station Chief. I can
                    remember in my own Foreign Service career I had a very valuable contact. I
                    thought to myself the CIA can handle this contact better than I can. I turned
                    him over to CIA with the understanding they'd show me all the reports they were
                    sending. That worked pretty well.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you sensing a generational change in the CIA because so many came out of
                    the OSS [Office of Strategic Services] and - very operational, going out and
                    jumping into Burma and doing nasty things to the Japanese and all. As much as
                    this daring-do spirit permeated, it is my understanding, still permeated within
                    the CIA. Was this beginning to dissipate? Maybe I'm over characterizing it,
                    too?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: There's no question the culture was changing. They were
                    traditionalists. The OSS types were fading out. Stan Turner, as you know, was
                    very much a non-traditionalist. He liked to dive down and pull up the young
                    people and make their voices heard. So we did shake the place up. We said this
                    is not going to be four different agencies. It's going to be one agency. We're
                    going to move people between the different parts of the organization. We're
                    going to bring about closer relationships between the clandestine service and
                    the analytical side. So I think we began to change the culture considerably.</p>
                <p>Q: Next time we'll just finish up this period in '81 when you left the CIA, but
                    one question I would like to ask and that was during the time you were there
                    about the role of the agency that you can talk about in the rapidly developing
                    things in Central America at that time and we can pick that up. Well, we can do
                    that now, yes.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, the agency essentially supported policy. There is this tendency
                    to think the agency creates policy. I can remember being on Portuguese TV one
                    time trying to persuade people that it was not a policy organization. There were
                    a number of covert action programs in Central America that were started in the
                    Carter administration. The Carter administration came in criticizing covert
                    action programs. It availed itself frequently of covert action programs.</p>

                <p>CARLUCCI: Attorney General Griffin Bell. Marvelous man. We'd go over the programs
                    thoroughly so everything was consistent with policy. No rogue activity
                    though.</p>
                <p>Q: Frank, we'll pick this up in '81- you left and went into private business for
                    a while. I'd like to cover a bit of that talking about your feeling about
                    Americans in the early '80s dealing abroad.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 15th of May, the Ides of May. Frank, could you talk about in '81
                    where you went and what type of work you were doing and why?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, I was financially a bit strapped so I had to leave DOD. I think
                    we covered that in the last session. And as I looked around for interesting
                    things to do, I talked to a number of people. As you know it's not easy to make
                    the transition from government to business and one of the more attractive
                    opportunities seemed to be a startup venture that Sears Roebuck was involved in
                    called Sears World Trade. Rod Hills was the CEO designate for Sears World Trade.
                    He talked to me. I think I was suggested to him by Don Rumsfeld who was on the
                    board of Sears. We had a very interesting conversation about starting a trading
                    company as one of the Sears Roebuck principal subsidiaries. Ed Telling was the
                    CEO of Sears at the time-he had a strategic vision that was based on
                    diversification-the purchase of Dean Witter, Allstate and Sears World Trade
                    which would leverage off the buying power of Sears around the world. We got this
                    company going with a lot of hope and promise.</p>

                    could buy goods cheaper because Sears had buying power overseas and sell them in
                    the United States and we could bundle exports from various U.S. companies and
                    get economies of scale that way and export overseas. There were a couple of
                    things wrong with that philosophy as it later turned out. One is that it was not
                    easy to leverage off of Sears buying power because Sears was a great big
                    bureaucracy and Sears buyers weren't particularly interested in Sears World
                    Trade. It didn't help their bonus. We were never able to fully exploit the Sears
                    buying power. Secondly, on the exporting side, we ran headlong into a very
                    strong dollar. Exports were pretty expensive. We made some mistakes on our own
                    too. We created a large infrastructure before we had the business to support
                    that infrastructure. We existed for a couple of years and never really got to
                    the break even point but we were lost in the rounding for Sears Roebuck. We were
                    never told that we had to break even at an early stage. We were told to build
                    the business as we best saw fit. We had a number of units and probably employed,
                    I'd say close to 75 or 80 people both in Chicago and here. We acquired a Dutch
                    company called Hagenmeyer which was a good company but somewhat difficult to
                    oversee. Dutch are great businessmen as you know but they aren't called stubborn
                    for nothing. When the leadership of Sears changed and Ed Brennan took over from
                    Ed Telling, he had a different strategic vision and he also had not had the same
                    positive experience, at least he didn't think he had the same positive
                    experience with Rod Hills and Sears World Trade that Telling had had. In the
                    meantime of course, Rod Hills moved out. I think Telling describes in his book
                    that it was Telling's suggestion that Rod move out. I became CEO. When Ed
                    Brennan became CEO of Sears, it became pretty obvious to me that Sears World
                    Trade days were numbered because Ed Brennan really wanted to go back to
                    traditional merchandising. He was a second generation Sears person and very much
                    oriented towards the domestic operations of Sears and not very interested in
                    international activities. That's in fact what happened. He decided to fold up
                    Sears World Trade. As coincidence would have it, that's about the same time I
                    received a call from the White House which led to my becoming National Security
                    Advisor.</p>
                <p>Q: Looking at this trade side, because the series of interviews is pointed more
                    at thForeign Affairs side, two questions. One, did you find your experience as
                    an Ambassador in the Foreign Service was helpful, and two, what was your
                    impression at that time of American big business? Was it hard to get it to look
                    at foreign trade as being important? Was the domestic market so all
                    encompassing, at least for many, that this is where they were pointed?</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Those are hard questions to answer. In terms of my Foreign Service
                    experience, it was helpful in certain respects. In some countries, I managed to
                    generate some business - in Portugal, for example. It gave you a certain amount
                    of access. It's not terribly useful in giving you the analytical skills that you
                    need in business-how to analyze a good acquisition or what the margins will be
                    on a particular trading deal is not something that you learn in the Foreign
                    Service. It takes time to acquire these skills. Even now, I'm a lot more
                    sophisticated than I was, but I still have a lot of trouble keeping up with the
                    young MBAs [master's degree in business administration] on such things as
                    acquisitions and present values analyses, and those kinds of things - IRRs. It's
                    helpful but it doesn't give you the full range of skills. In terms of attitudes
                    towards international trade, international business, that varied enormously by
                    company and still does, although increasingly companies are recognizing that
                    they have to be global players. Sears Roebuck, as I mentioned, really didn't
                    have any global concept. Ed Telling had a global concept but when he left,
                    nobody else picked it up. There are other companies that were quite interested
                    in world trade. As time goes on, the number of companies that plan to go global
                    of course has increased. It's a lot different today than it was then.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned Portugal. What about Brazil? Brazil is a huge market. I also
                    have the feeling it was not an easy market for Americans to get into or was
                    it?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: We did some things in Brazil. I remember going down there and working
                    with them. We did some things in the rest of Latin America. I think we were
                    involved in some coffee trades with Brazil at one point. We had some projects in
                    the Amazon. I can't remember, it's been some time what the actual projects were.
                    We were doing some things in Brazil. Most of our activities were in the Far
                    East. We had some activities in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China importing from
                    that area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were called by the White House when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It was probably late November or December of 1986. I think it was late
                    November. It was a Monday at noon and on Sunday night I had received a call from
                    a journalist friend of mine, Arnaud De Borchgrave saying, “Frank do you know
                    anything about becoming National Security Advisor?”I said, “I don't know what
                    you were talking about.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, I just heard it from a good source.” Actually he'd heard it from
                    Bill Casey. “The President is going to ask you to be National Security
                    Advisor.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I don't know anything about it and I don't think I'd be particularly
                    interested.” I was having lunch the next day at The Willard. I got a call from
                    Don Regan asking me if I could come in to the White House through the Treasury
                    entrance through the basement so I would not be seen by the press. I went in to
                    the basement and there was Don Regan and the President.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Don Regan at that time being...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Chief of Staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chief of Staff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: There were only three of us in the room. Ronald Reagan made his
                    approach by saying, “I'd like you to be my National Security Advisor because
                    you're the only person that George Shultz and Cap Weinberger can agree on.” I
                    wasn't sure if that was a very good qualification.</p>
                <p>I responded by saying the he ought to understand there were at least two things
                    that I disagreed with. I disagreed with some of the things that were almost done
                    at Reykjavik and I disagreed with Iran Contra. The President then went through
                    the Iran Contra drill that everybody later became so familiar with where he
                    starts out saying that it was not a swap - arms for hostages - and ends up
                    convincing you that it was. Then I tried to describe to him what I felt were my
                    strong points and my weak points so he would know what he was getting as a
                    National Security Advisor. After weighing it, I think I went home and discussed
                    it with my wife, I decided it was an obligation that I really should take on. I
                    wasn't that keen to do it but it was just something that needed to be done,
                    clearly. Besides, I needed a job!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mention Reykjavik. Could you explain Reykjavik and
                        whaalmost happened that had you concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: That was the negotiation where Gorbachev caught the President by
                    surprise and proposed the virtual elimination of nuclear weapons if the
                    President would give up SDI, the Strategic Defense Initiative, what the press
                    liked to label Star Wars - a misnomer. At any rate, the administration came very
                    close to agreeing to that but Ronald Reagan fortunately was unwilling to give up
                    SDI. Obviously, this had a real traumatic effect in Europe. One of the ceaseless
                    tasks that I had, and my predecessors had all had was trying to convince Ronald
                    Reagan that nuclear weapons were essential to keep the balance between the big
                    powers. The Soviets had conventional superiority and nuclear weapons had
                    actually kept the peace for many years. While we should reduce them - no
                    question we should negotiate a balanced reduction. I was very much in favor of
                    that, to simply eliminate them would put us at very high risk and traumatize our
                    allies. Of course this was the position Margaret Thatcher took as well. That was
                    very helpful. Ronald Reagan had always been very much against nuclear weapons
                    and the faster you could get rid of them, the better he liked it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I actually started on January first. There were some benefits from
                    Sears that didn't accrue until the end of the year and I told the President I'd
                    start on January first. I spent some time making plans up 'til then and was
                    National Security Advisor from January first, I guess it was [to] November of
                    1987.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '87?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you took over the job, what did you see... What was
                        your owpersonal agenda when you went there thinking this is what I better

                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Very simple. It was clean up the mess. In my judgement it was a mess.
                    As you know the President had fired Oliver North. John Poindexter had left and
                    it was up to me and Colin Powell to fire Fawn Hall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fawn Hall being...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Oliver North's secretary who later became somewhat famous for shredding
                    documents. But the organizational structure, in my judgement, was
                    non-functional. We had two deputies. The General Counsel was somebody who
                    functioned as a Special Assistant. It was a part time General Counsel who was
                    basically Special Assistant to the National Security Advisor. The one
                    functioning part was the Executive Secretariat. Oliver North had a separate
                    office called Political-Military Affairs. My view of that was that the whole NSC
                    was political-military affairs and if you give somebody that title they had a
                    hunting license. Which is precise what Oliver North did. He went hunting. I
                    eliminated that office completely. If memory serves me correctly, I ended up
                    firing some 65 percent of the staff. George Bush at one point told me that the
                    President was getting worried that I was firing too many people, so I wrote him
                    a handwritten note saying, “Don't worry, Mr. President, this will come out all
                    right.”</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>Ronald Reagan says in his book it did come out all right. We put in an
                    organizational structure where you had a single Deputy and I brought Colin
                    Powell in to be my Deputy-probably the best move I made. I set up a separate
                    General Counsel's office and he was the one that had the hunting license. He
                    could go anywhere he wanted, attend any meeting he wanted and had unfettered
                    access to me so that we had some controls on the place. Then there was the
                    question of sorting through the relationship between the National Security
                    Advisor and the Chief of Staff, which had been a somewhat fractious one and the
                    question of access to the President. We had the Scowcroft commission report at
                    the time, which made a series of recommendations in part based on some of the
                    briefings I had given. In any event, it was determined that I would have direct
                    access to the President. In fact, I insisted on that although at all the
                    meetings, I made it a point of inviting - telling - the chief of staff that I
                    was having a meeting with the President and he was free to come in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the chief? It was still Regan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It was still Don Regan at the time but he only lasted a month. I ended
                    up firing Don Regan then Howard Baker took over. While there was sort of a break
                    in period while we had to adjust to each other, once we got going it was an
                    extraordinarily smooth and productive relationship. If you are interested I can
                    describe the firing of Don Regan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like for you to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Don has a little bit of it in his book, but he doesn't have the full
                    description. I'd had breakfast with Don Regan one morning and I said, “Don, has
                    anybody talked to you about leaving because reports are all over” because I'd
                    been tipped off that he was going to be leaving and that Howard Baker would
                    replace him-”because there are rumors that Howard Baker is replacing you.”</p>
                <p>He said, “No, nobody has talked to me Frank.”</p>
                <p>I forgot about it. That wasn't really my business. About two o'clock in the
                    afternoon I got a call from Bob Tuttle who was the White House personnel
                    officer. He said, “Frank, it's all over CNN that Don Regan has been fired and
                    that Howard Baker has been named chief of staff.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Why are you talking to me about it?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, I'm not sure that anybody has talked to Don Regan. And you're the
                    next highest ranking person in the White House and you need to talk to Don
                    Regan.”</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>I said, “Well, before I jump into that snake pit, I better call the President.”
                    So I called the President. He's up at his quarters and I said, “Mr. President,
                    this is all over TV, have you said anything to Don Regan?”</p>
                <p>And the answer was, “Oh, my goodness.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Uh oh.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well what do you think I should do?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, I don't know, let me go down and talk to Don Regan.”</p>
                <p>There was a New York Times journalist in Don Regan's office and I had the
                    Secretary go in and say I had to see him urgently, “Please toss out the
                    journalist.” I went in and said, “Don, remember that conversation we had this
                    morning? Well, it is true. The President has decided to change chief of staffs
                    and Howard Baker is going to be taking your place.”</p>
                <p>Don Regan, as everybody knows, has an Irish temper and he exploded. There was
                    nothing for me to do but go back to my office and call the President and say to
                    the President, “Mr. President, you really have to talk to Don Regan. You need to
                    call him.” And then I ran down to Don Regan's office and Don Regan wasn't even
                    going to answer the phone. I said, “Now come on Don, that's the President of the
                    United States. You've got to answer the phone.” What then ensured one of the
                    shorter historic phone calls on record. When the President did say something, I
                    couldn't hear him obviously, to Don Regan about making a change, Don Regan said
                    something like, “Thank You Mr. President,” and hung up. That's when he dictated
                    his one sentence letter saying Mr. President, I hereby resign as your Chief of
                    Staff. That was the firing of Don Regan.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your sense that there had been no real control in not only the
                    National Security Council but elsewhere in the White House? One does have the
                    feeling that people were bypassing the President all the time and that there
                    wasn't somebody taking control?</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I made it a point of not going into history. Instead I had my hands
                    full looking at the future. So I didn't try to do any analysis of what went
                    wrong. I just tried to fix the situation so it would be right going forward. It
                    was a very loose management structure. I can't really speak to Don Regan's shop
                    and how he managed his shop but certainly the National Security Council, as I
                    found it, was very loosely organized. John Poindexter, I was told, would retreat
                    to his office for an hour or two a day and just communicate with his people by
                    e-mail. Anybody in the NSC could communicate to him. There were some desirable
                    aspects to that but it also meant that people could bypass their superiors and
                    things could get out of control because one person can't control that many
                    people. I forget how many there were-120 or something like that. There had to be
                    order in the channels of communication. I have a bit of an aversion to using
                    computers for that kind of communication so I shut it down and said if anybody
                    has anything to communicate with me, they can pick up the phone or come through
                    the door. That worked pretty well particularly since I had Colin Powell who
                    could speak with authority and the two of us could divide responsibility. We set
                    up a system of dividing how meetings would be handled and how he and I would
                    allocate our respective times. We brought in Grant Greene to be Executive
                    Secretary. He got that organization functioning well.</p>
                <p>Just as an example of the kinds of things that had been allowed to languish,
                    Colin came into my office one day and said, “Frank, I know how you love arms
                    control. Take a look at this.” He had a stack at least, I'd say, two feet high
                    of backlogged arms control decisions. He said, “you've got no choice but to go
                    through these and make your decisions or decide to take them to the President.
                    So, I set aside an hour or an hour and a half every lunch and for about two
                    weeks, I went through nothing but arms control, trying to make choices. Where I
                    thought I could do it I did, and saved the others. I remember we were down in
                    Miami meeting the Pope and I told Howard Baker that I had to sit down with the
                    President and go through these arms control issues. So we sat in a very steamy
                    hotel room in Miami, just Howard Baker and the President and me where I tried to
                    lead the President through a whole host of arms control decisions, and that's
                    real esoteric. At least it was at that time. It may be simpler now. I wasn't
                    even sure I fully understood all of it. I could never tell how much the
                    President understood. I felt he always came out in the right place. We got down
                    to two or three issues where I knew Cap and George would be at one another's
                    throats. I can't now remember what they are but if you gave me some time I could
                    probably remember. I told the President, well this one Cap or George are
                    undoubtedly going to appeal. You're going to have to tell them personally. When
                    we got back to Washington, we finally got them all out of the way. Once we got
                    them all out of the way, the stage was then set for us to begin some serious
                    negotiations. I can remember Rysmertnik, who became Soviet Foreign Minister,
                    telling me, when I was National Security Advisor, “Well, we finally are able to
                    negotiate with you people because you now are making some decisions. We couldn't
                    negotiate with you before.” We got the process going. It had been clearly jammed
                    up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you had fired 65 people. Why ...? CARLUCCI:
                        Sixty-five percent.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>Q: Sixty-five percent. Were these just too much politically oriented or were they
                    doing the job or you were trying to trim down or what was the...?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: First of all, I should clarify what firing generally means in terms of
                    the NSC. It means, in many cases, sending them back to their agencies because
                    the NSC is generally composed of people who are on loan from agencies. In some
                    cases they left the government. They were people that either I or their
                    supervisors felt had either outlived their usefulness or we had some new people
                    that we wanted to bring in. In some cases they were very good people and we hung
                    on to them. Let me give you a case in point. For years, I have been very close
                    to Bob Oakley, who I regard as a very talented individual, who knows the Middle
                    East extremely well. When I brought Bob into the NSC, Dennis Ross was there. I
                    talked to Dennis and I'd heard good things about him and I said, “Dennis would
                    you be willing to work for Bob?”</p>
                <p>The answer was yes. The result was I had a hell of a strong team on the Middle
                    East because I had Bob Oakley and Dennis Ross as my two leaders.</p>
                <p>Q: During this '86 to '87 period, this was the post Reykjavik thing but Gorbachev
                    was in charge of the Soviet Union. Did you see a real change in attitude towards
                    the Soviet Union on the part of the President and his team looking to see who we
                    could do business with or not?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: No question that attitudes began to change. The President had a
                    fascination with the Soviet Union. While the speech writers liked to put in evil
                    empire and those kinds of things, he really had a deep interest in two things:
                    freedom of religion in the Soviet Union and human rights. Finally, when I got to
                    the NSC, there was a lady named Suzanne Massey who was a social anthropologist
                    from Harvard who was the only outsider I could find that got in to see the
                    President alone. She would go in and talk to him about the Soviet Union. I
                    finally said to the President, “Look, Mr. President, I can't function as your
                    National Security Advisor unless I know what's going on here.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Fine, well you can sit in.” So I sat in and it was a very, perfectly
                    proper, very cordial relationship that they had. She had a lot of impact on the
                    President. They didn't talk much about geopolitics. They talked a lot about the
                    social issues in the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>The President also used to carry around with him, names of Soviet dissidents
                    who'd been imprisoned. Where he got them I don't know. Whenever George Shultz
                    would go over there, he'd give George some names and say, “I'd like you to get
                    this person or that person out.”</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>Once we got the arms control decisions in place, there remained the question of
                    conditioning the President to negotiations which we knew were coming. George
                    Shultz had done a wonderful job, which he describes in his book, of conditioning
                    the President for negotiations and then saying we're going enter into
                    negotiations. These are your choices. Do you want to do this? And Ronald Reagan,
                    here's where he deserves real credit because his constituency was not terribly
                    supportive, said yes we are going to negotiate with the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>Howard Baker said to me, “Frank, you need to prepare the President for these
                    negotiations.” Knowing how he operates, you don't prepare him best by inundating
                    him with a lot of position papers. He likes to see people.”</p>
                <p>Howard and I agreed that we should start bringing some people in?</p>
                <p>I went to the President with a list of names. I can remember I mentioned
                    Brzezinski he liked, Richard Pearl he liked, Kissinger he was not terribly keen
                    to see, but the name that hit the jackpot was the first one I mentioned: Richard
                    Nixon. He said, “Yes, he'd like to see Richard Nixon.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Why don't we start with him?” And I'm not sure this has come out to this
                    day, but we smuggled Richard Nixon back into the White House. It was the first
                    time he was in since he left the White House in disgrace, maybe the only time,
                    I'm not sure. We flew him by helicopter to the back lawn and I met him right at
                    the door of the White House basement entrance and I took him up to Ronald
                    Reagan's study on the 3rd floor of the White House. Just Richard Nixon, Ronald
                    Reagan, Howard Baker, and me. Nixon and Reagan discussed the Soviet Union for
                    I'd say, about an hour and a quarter, maybe two hours. Obviously a fascinating
                    discussion. Nixon doing most of the talking, Reagan listening. And that's how we
                    kicked off the preparations for the negotiations. Then we brought in various
                    other people. I think Brzezinski did come in. Richard Pearl did come in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These negotiations were pointed towards what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: They were pointed first towards the INF [Intermediate Range Nuclear
                    Force] treaty. As you may recall with the deployment of SS20s we responded with
                    the deployment of Pershings and GLCMs [Ground Launched Cruise Missile]
                    (Shevardnadze later conceded that the deploying the SS-20s had been a mistake.).
                    We began negotiating the INF treaty. George Shultz asked me to participate in
                    the negotiations. I chose not to initially because I was a little worried about
                    maintaining the independence of the National Security Advisor, but I concluded
                    that working with George was more important. I went to Moscow with George. That
                    was the trip in June of '87 where Gorbachev blew up at me resulting in the
                    postponement of the summit. I can go into that if you want.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>Q: Yes. Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Kenny Adelman has this in his book because he was in the meeting. He
                    was taking notes. It went something like this: Gorbachev, as was well known,
                    hated SDI. Not without reason, because he knew it would force a reconfiguration
                    of the Soviet strategic forces. He believed we could do it, unlike a lot of
                    people in the United States. At one point in the deliberations on INF, he said
                    something to George like, “You're going to have to get rid of the SDI.” George,
                    I guess, had been tired of hearing this, and he said, “Well, SDI is really
                    President Reagan's initiative so I'm going to ask Frank to respond to that.”</p>
                <p>I was tired of it, too. I guess we were all tired. I said, “Well, Mr. Secretary
                    General, (which is what he was at the time), what you just said is totally
                    unacceptable to the President.”</p>
                <p>With that Gorbachev threw down his pencil. His staff later told me this was not
                    planned-he threw his pencil and said if that's the attitude you have, then there
                    won't be a summit.</p>
                <p>George said, “Fine. There won't be a summit.”</p>
                <p>And I thought to myself, bless George's heart.</p>
                <p>And that's why the summit was postponed from September to December. I remember we
                    had a December summit. It was because of that one episode.</p>
                <p>We started with the INF treaty and then moved on to various regional
                    negotiations. Remember George set up an agenda which was arms control, regional
                    issues and human rights issues. Later on when I became Secretary of Defense, I
                    set up Defense agenda which paralleled it. We would talk about arms control but
                    not as negotiations. The Soviets wanted to talk about those. I said, “I'll only
                    talk about those if you talk about other things - doctrine, military doctrine,
                    avoiding dangerous incidents (We had Major Nicholson assassinated on a
                    legitimate mission in East Germany.) and military to military contacts.” Those
                    proved to be very beneficial for several reasons. First of all, I went over and
                    lectured at the Voroshilov military academy, lectured the top Soviet generals
                    and admirals probably about 100 of them with Marshall Akrimayoff, their chief of
                    staff, introducing me, on why we considered Soviet military doctrine to be
                    offensive in nature, why they represented a threat to us, and why our doctrine
                    was defensive. An extraordinary session. One of them got up and said to me, “How
                    is it you know so much about us?”</p>
                <p>I said, “It's very difficult. We have to do it from satellites, and calculate
                    what you're spending for that kind of force, and convert it into dollars. It
                    would make it a lot easier if you'd just do what we do and publish your military
                    budget. With that the room broke up into laughter. I said to my escort officer
                    later, “Why did they laugh?”</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>He said, “You don't understand. You attacked the heart of theisystem which was
                    secrecy.”</p>
                <p>Then I visited various war games and climbed through the Blackjack bomber. That
                    had an interesting effect too because the Soviet people then say well we've
                    never seen this kind of military equipment. We've never seen these kind of
                    maneuvers, yet the U.S. Secretary of Defense can see them. What's going on
                    here?</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, we structured contacts on down through our military establishment
                    ending up with ship visits. We started with Bill Crowe's relationship with
                    Marshall Akrimayoff, which developed into a very good dialogue, and led to
                    various other relationships all the way down. So the Soviet military began to
                    see, a) our strength, but also b) our real intentions, not what they had been
                    told. That began to bring about very decided change of attitude on the part of
                    the Soviet military. This is sort of an untold story about how our military,
                    without firing a shot, helped to win the Cold War.</p>
                <p>Q: Going back to the White House years, you had the reorganization, getting arms
                    control, getting some decisions made, and getting ready for further
                    negotiations. I have the feeling that there was, particularly early on, there
                    was sort of a fight for the soul of Ronald Reagan within the White House. They
                    had your triumvirate and your various groups doing this. Had that settled down
                    by the time you were...if it were indeed true...?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Both Howard Baker and I had a very strong mandate because at least for
                    the first month. Ronald Reagan was in a state of semi-shock. He didn't really
                    understand what had hit him. So we had to assume a large responsibility. Colin
                    Powell has a quote in his book of us leaving the Oval Office after our first or
                    second meeting with the President and me turning to Colin and saying, “Colin, we
                    didn't sign on to run the world.” But we really had a big charter.</p>
                <p>The main fights were those over speeches. What would be the tone of the speeches.
                    Colin took over that chore and he was masterful. Howard Baker brought in a new
                    team which worked very cooperatively with us. Conservative groups felt very
                    strongly about SDI, which was fine. They came in several times lobbying on the
                    behalf of the Contras and Mozambique. They had access to Gary Bauer, who was an
                    active spokesman for them in the White House. Pat Buchanan was still in the
                    White House but he didn't get too much involved in foreign policy. Some people
                    would get to the President from time to time. I don't know how, but he would get
                    some ideas that were not policy and would seem to come from very conservative
                    groups. That was not a major problem. I think we were able to deal with it
                    effectively. They certainly had a right to have their views heard. My view of
                    Ronald Reagan was that he was conservative in his approach, no question, yet he
                    was anything but a right winger, and had a masterful touch in listening to
                    people. He'd listen and then he'd leave the room and leave the problem to us.
                    They all felt good that they'd had their day with the President. We were left
                    with the problem, but that was our job.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>The other big issue was our support for the Contras in Central America, and even
                    Ronald Reagan's own minister came in to lobby him against that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about a religious minister.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes. Religious minister. To lobby with him, he brought in a group of
                    ministers. We got incessant lobbying on that issue from both sides-from the
                    liberal side and the conservative side. Ronald Reagan was determined to continue
                    his support of the Contras.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Frank, what was the role at that time of George Bush. He
                        waVice President, and did he participate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: George Bush was always present at our briefings with the President when
                    he was in town. He participated in all the NSC meetings when he was in town, of
                    course. I would go in periodically and bring him up to date on some of the
                    issues that he might have missed when he was out of town and I would, on
                    occasion, seek his advice because he'd been very helpful to me when I came in.
                    When I first came in, even before I'd taken the job National Security Advisor,
                    he asked me to come around to his house. He spent an hour or so with me just
                    giving me the lay of the land in the White House and how I might operate, what I
                    should expect, which was very helpful. I tried to keep him fully informed.
                    George Bush in meetings, generally did not take strong positions on the policy
                    issues under debate nor did he seem to do so in the small briefings that I would
                    give the President. Either he was just holding himself in reserve or he was
                    conveying his views to the President privately in the, I think weekly, lunch he
                    used to have with the President. George Bush became a much - I wasn't in his
                    administration but from everything I hear - much more detail oriented, much
                    stronger figure when he became President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the prince in waiting, in a way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I guess you could describe it that way.</p>
                <p>Q: What about James Baker? Your turf was National Security Affairs, and he later
                    became Secretary of State. I was wondering how his interest in those areas was
                    and how he operated.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, he was Secretary of Treasury when I was National Security
                    Advisor. He made it clear at the outset that he was the Czar of economic affairs
                    and if anybody wanted to deal with economic affairs they had to deal with him,
                    which was fine. He wanted to be sure that the National Security Council didn't
                    get into it too deeply, but he and I agreed that I would go to the weekly
                    breakfasts that we had with George Shultz so that I was kept informed. Jim was a
                    very strong figure. When we got into the negotiations on NAFTA [North American
                    Free Trade Agreement] with Canada we'd had a slow down. Jim moved in and handled
                    it personally and did a masterful job. He wrapped it up when nobody else could.
                    He did not attempt to get into national security issues from his perch in
                    Treasury.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself betwixt and between George Shultz
                        and CaWeinberger?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: That's the story of my life. I was constantly negotiating between those
                    two. That started way back when I was with both of them in OMB. When I was
                    Deputy Secretary of Defense, I had proposed breakfast once a week between the
                    two of them so they could try and see eye to eye. I remember one breakfast broke
                    down and George walked out. When I became National Security Advisor, I would
                    have them once a week for lunch in the White House and we'd try and work out the
                    differences, but they both had strongly held views. George put it best when I
                    think he said, “Cap is a position taker and I'm more analytical.” Cap is very
                    quick to take positions, he's a lawyer and George waits to take positions but
                    both are equally tenacious once they've taken a position. It was just a question
                    of chipping away and I tried to avoid having these issues come before the
                    President but on occasion, I had to take the differences to the President to get
                    them resolved.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have any on the Iran-by this time it was no longer the Iran Contra,
                    but the Contra work in Nicaragua. Did you have a feeling on the Contra issue
                    before you came in to be National Security Advisor?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes. I had some questions about its effectiveness. Once I got in, I did
                    make a trip down to Central America and I concluded that it was a desirable
                    thing to continue to do. There was some opposition growing. Oscar Arias, in
                    Costa Rica, was a bit of a problem-more than a bit of a problem. Of course, the
                    Iran Contra thing did not help. After my visit to Salvador and Honduras and
                    Costa Rica, I concluded that we needed to continue to pursue that strategy. In
                    fact, what I tried to do was to put together a political coalition. That was not
                    my side of the business - I had certain restrictions on me - so I asked Howard
                    Baker's shop to put that together. We did begin to work with people like Bob
                    Graham on the Hill. It was going pretty well until all of a sudden Howard Baker
                    brought some new people on the staff and they negotiated the so called Wright
                    Agreement with Jim Wright. I heard about that when I was traveling in Bonn.</p>
                <p>Colin called me and said, “We've got this agreement with Jim Wrighand here's what
                    it is.”</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>I said, “That undermines our whole strategy.” And indeed it diprove to undermine
                    our whole strategy.</p>
                <p>Colin said, “I'm afraid the President has already signed off on it Frank.” So
                    that's when they got ahead of us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that more a problem because Howard Baker was chief of
                        staff, but a creature of Congress and he looked for deals with
                        Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: When he brought in on his staff a former congressman from Texas, Tom
                    Loeffler, who had access to Wright, he more or less rammed it through. It just
                    got ahead of the process. Howard obviously supported it. I told Howard of my
                    opposition but it didn't work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what happened by the time you were leaving? Where
                        did thNicaraguan business stand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I went over to Defense and we'd had all these problems with Jim Wright
                    who clearly was communicating, if not daily on a weekly basis, with the
                    Sandinistas. The so-called agreement basically put our whole strategy in
                    jeopardy but we managed to hold together. But I can't tell you how many hours I
                    spent arguing with Jim Wright about this and trying to work with him, but it
                    proved to be impossible. It was also very difficult to work with David Bonner.
                    Tony Cuello, who happens to be a friend and right now a business associate, was
                    much easier to work with and I could talk to Tony.</p>
                <p>Q: Why don't we stop at this point and we'll pick it up next time when you leave
                    the National Security? Is there something else we should cover do you think?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: On the National Security Council? I think we covered mosof it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we'll pick it up next time when you're off to

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 7th of July, 1998. Frank, you went over to Defense as Secretary of
                    Defense. When did you go and could I get when you were there and when you
                    left?</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, I'm speaking from memory. I believe I went over in November of
                    1987 and I left when George Bush took over which was what January of '89. I
                    think I was nominated in November. It only took me three or two weeks to get
                    confirmed which was some sort of record on confirmation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd been around so long on various things, this was a
                        natural.How did this appointment come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, Cap had let Howard Baker know that he wanted to stedown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Weinberger.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Cap Weinberger, yes. I was National Security Advisor at the time.
                    Howard Baker was chief of staff. Cap had suggested Will Taft as his replacement
                    and I had a high regard for Will. Howard Baker wanted me to take the job. I at
                    first said, “No.” I was quite happy where I was. He talked to me two or three
                    times. The two reasons that Howard had were that I could get confirmed very fast
                    and that the President was quite comfortable that I had someone who could
                    immediately step into my role in Colin Powell, my deputy. I guess after some
                    discussion I said, “Well, fine. If that's really what the President wants, I'd
                    obviously be happy to do it.”</p>
                <p>And then I had a conversation with the President. I could remembeone aspect of
                    that conversation. He asked me if Colin could replace me.</p>
                <p>I said, “Not only could he replace me, in my judgement Mr. President, but he'd be
                    far better than I am in the job.” I said, “I'm not seeking compliments. I just
                    think he will be.” And as you know Colin did perform magnificently in the
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went over to Defense, here you had been betwixt
                        and between George Shultz and Casper Weinberger, a long time in various
                        positions. When Weinberger left did you have an agenda or something
                        different from Weinberger or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes. I wouldn't say I came in with an agenda but I came in with
                    somewhat different perspective on some of the issues. For example, George Shultz
                    wanted to have direct contact with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and Bill
                    Crowe. Cap had objected to that. I had no objection to that. Cap had basically
                    dragged his feet and found all kinds of reasons not to negotiate with his Soviet
                    counterpart, Minister of Defense Yazov. I turned that around and negotiated with
                    him. Cap had been pushing very hard for an early deployment of SDI. I had
                    serious questions in my own mind as to the feasibility of early deployment,
                    indeed the feasibility of the whole program. I commissioned a study which said,
                    yes it will be feasible, but you've got to get the cost down. I worked harder at
                    getting the cost down and moved SDI pretty much into the Pentagon system so that
                    I could evaluate it's priorities alongside other priorities where as Cap had
                    kept it very much separate and above the kind of scrutiny some of the other
                    programs went through. So there really were different things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: That doesn't mean, by the way, let me emphasize. That doesn't mean, I
                    didn't have very high regard for Cap. He was a great Secretary of Defense.</p>
                <p>Q: This applies to everyone because I think everyone comes in with a somewhat
                    different agenda or somewhat different set of priorities than his or her
                    predecessor. How did you find the atmosphere at the Pentagon? I would have
                    thought that where everything was sort of together at the white House, the
                    Pentagon was almost too regulated-a big structure.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It's a big structure, but I always found the Pentagon pretty
                    responsive. The key is in having good military assistants and using them. Now I
                    had a big handicap. That was since there was only a little over a year left in
                    the Reagan administration, it was extremely difficult for me to bring in new
                    people and get them confirmed. So I had to really make do with the people who
                    were there and there were some I didn't think were appropriate. No secret, I
                    moved Frank Gafney out. Cap suggested that Frank Gafney be made assistant
                    secretary and I said no. I didn't find his style compatible with my own. So
                    there were those changes that I made.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering whether you found...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The state of the Pentagon. The Pentagon's morale was heavily impacted
                    by what's happening on the budget. When I got there, I had to do the first big
                    cut. I took something like 350 billion dollars out of the five year plan. People
                    began to feel the pain, not nearly as much as they felt it in subsequent years.
                    That always has an impact on attitudes. I felt the institution was working
                    pretty well. After all, it hasn't been that long since I've been there. I spent
                    a lot of time working on internal management when I was Deputy Secretary. Will
                    Taft had tried to carry through on a lot of things that we had put in place
                    during the first couple of years. So I was quite familiar with the management
                    structure. I'd like to think that after my almost 30 years of government service
                    I knew pretty much where the bodies were buried and where the leaders were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Admiral Crowe was the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Terrific. He's a wonderful man, great sense of humor, very easy to work
                    with, commands a lot of respect from the services. He didn't have the public
                    flair of Colin Powell but he was a very solid, serious man who did not hesitate
                    to step up to the difficult jobs. I can remember when the USS Vincennes shot
                    down the Iranian Air Bus. Bill Crowe called me in the middle of the night and
                    said, “We've shot down an Iranian F-14.” He called me a couple hours later and
                    said, “Well, we're not sure it's an F-14.” And I said, “I better come in.” By
                    that time we discovered that it was really an airliner and he notified Colin
                    Powell and I notified the President. One of the things you obviously have to do
                    is go out and tell the press. Bill Crowe immediately volunteered to do that. We
                    all know that initial reports are never accurate and the press takes them as
                    accurate no matter how many times you say they are not going to be accurate. We
                    always get castigated if those reports differ from subsequent reports. That, of
                    course, happened in this case. I probably should have done the press
                    conferences. I cite that as an example of Bill Crowe's willingness to step
                    forward and take the heat.</p>
                <p>Q: It strikes me that Crowe also had a feel for the change of situation in the
                    world. Particularly what used to be the Soviet Union, still Soviet Union at that
                    time that put him ahead of many of the military people.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Crowe's role in the dismemberment of the Soviet Union was pivotal and
                    it's really never been told. Indeed the whole role of the military, as I think
                    we've said in the previous sessions, has never been told. After I had my initial
                    meetings with Yazov, and we got the Major Nicholson affair settled - you may
                    recall that was the American who was killed by the Soviets in East Germany. He
                    was on a liaison mission. He was brutally shot and left to die in the field. Cap
                    had correctly told the Soviets that we didn't want to negotiate with them on any
                    kind of military contacts until they had apologized for that. Well, I ended up
                    practically writing the Soviet apology in Minister Yazov's office. Thus, we got
                    pretty much the apology we needed. We then set up contacts, starting with Bill
                    Crowe and Marshall Akrimayoff, former chief of staff. Crowe and Akrimayoff hit
                    it off immediately. That relationship reshaped all kinds of attitudes on the
                    part of the Soviet military. It was a very productive kind of personal
                    relationship. Bill Crowe went over there several times. Akrimayoff came over to
                    the United States as Crowe's guest. It worked very well.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that Crowe was having the same challenge within our own military
                    in changing our way of thinking? Militaries tend to feed enemies and very
                    obviously the Soviet Union had been the enemy for so long.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I didn't find a problem, to be quite candid with you. I thought our
                    military was more than willing to engage in a dialogue. In fact they looked
                    forward to it. They liked the exchange of visits. We ended up with a ship visit.
                    We had all kinds of exchanges and they enjoyed them. They called them
                    productive. I don't recall anybody saying to me they are still the enemy, I
                    don't want to have anything to do with them. That was not the attitude at all.
                    The attitude was look, if this can help solve the Cold War, we want to do
                    it.</p>
                <p>Q: What about Congress? Are there concerns within Congress, the congressional
                    staff about this growing contact between the United States and the Soviet
                    Union?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I don't recall getting any static from the Hill either. Certainly Sam
                    Nunn was supportive. Aspen was supportive. John Warner, Bill Dickinson. The
                    people I dealt with who were the ranking people and the Chairmen of my
                    committees. The Appropriations Committees were supportive. I didn't detect any
                    criticism from the Hill. The Hill was principally interested in budget issues.
                    Of course, don't forget that the President set the tone. Ronald Reagan stood
                    pretty tall in the Congress in those days; he had recovered fully from the
                    Iran-Contra affair. He was leading the negotiating effort. George Shultz was
                    actively participating. I found the Congress primarily supportive.</p>
                <p>Q: What about budget problems in Congress?</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, there the principal issue that I faced was the issue that the
                    Pentagon still faces today. That issue is reducing the support infrastructure as
                    much as you take down the fighting forces. When I started the cuts, I said to
                    myself there just has to be a way that I can reduce the [base] infrastructure so
                    that we don't get the tooth to tail ratio worse than it is. We have not been
                    totally successful in that, because the force structure has come down around 33
                    percent, whereas the [support] infrastructure has come down about 25 percent.
                    The idea I came up with was the base closing commission. I don't know if I've
                    every told you the story of the base closing commission? I thought to myself
                    there has to be a way to close bases. I remember the nightmare Elliott
                    Richardson went through when he tried to close some bases. They were all over
                    him and he ended up not closing any. Somebody called to my attention a bill that
                    Congressman Dick Army had introduced and which set up a congressional commission
                    on closing bases.</p>
                <p>I asked Dick Army to come and see me and I said, “Look, I think your bill has
                    some attractive features but it can't be a congressional commission. It has to
                    be run by the Executive branch. Its recommendations have to be forwarded intact.
                    You can't take out the pieces. If I restructure it that way, will you support
                    it?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Yes, we can work together on it.”</p>
                <p>I recall that Sam Nunn was immediately supportive. Les Aspen thoughI was crazy
                    and said so, but later became one of the biggest supporters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Les Aspen being the...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The chairman of the House Committee, House Armed Services Committee in
                    those days. I think they call it the National Security Committee now. Bill
                    Dickinson, the minority member of the House and John Warner, the minority member
                    of the Senate, were both supportive. I then went to see Ronald Reagan. I'll
                    never forget the meeting. I said, “Mr. President, I need to tell you that I'm
                    going to close some military bases.” And he just stared at me. I said, “Mr.
                    President, I'm going to do this in a way that's going to be politically
                    acceptable. I don't think you are going to have to get involved.”</p>
                <p>He stared me and he finally said, “Alright. If that's what you wanto do.”</p>
                <p>That was my blessing, my enthusiastic blessing from the President. He knew what
                    this entailed politically, too. The third step was to get the right people to
                    lead it. After considerable effort, I persuaded Abe Ribicoff to be co-chairman
                    along with Jack Edwards. Abe Ribicoff had such a sterling reputation for
                    integrity on the Hill and that was the main reason the first BRAC [Base
                    Realignment and Closure] was accepted.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: That's right.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: And Governor of Connecticut. He was known of Mr. Integrity in the
                    Senate. He was a democrat so I was not being partisan. Once he accepted, the
                    commission got going. I think we put very good people on it. People like Arthur
                    Levitt, Don Craig. I reached out to people of stature. So the commission was
                    successful and as you know there were a lot of follow on base closing
                    commissions - the BRAC - process, which is now in trouble for political reasons.
                    It was by and large successful over a period of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain to somebody who might not understand
                        what thpolitical sensitivity about base closings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, no community likes to have a base closed because people are put
                    out of work. Now as history tells us, the communities end up doing good things
                    with the base structure after it is closed and in the long run they're better
                    off. But trying to persuade the community of that fact is very difficult.
                    Congressmen are almost instinctively opposed to any base closure. President
                    Clinton violated the sanctity of the base closure commissions recommendation by
                    taking out two bases in politically sensitive states, California and Texas, and
                    “privatizing” them in place. The Congress has now understandably said Clinton
                    destroyed the whole process; therefore, we won't close any more bases. That's
                    very unhelpful because absent closing basis, you're going to have to cut back on
                    the fighting forces or the equipment we give our soldiers. We're going to keep
                    bases open to deal with the “Indian threat” while we deprive our soldiers of the
                    next generation of tanks or aircraft.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fort Apache remains.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Fort Apache remains.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned the problem of trying to disassemble the infrastructure as
                    opposed to the-or at least in proportion to the fighting force. Why is this such
                    a problem?</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Because [support] infrastructure means jobs and they're public sector
                    jobs. The politicians like public sector jobs. In fact, we ought to do more, far
                    more than close bases. We ought to privatize a lot of the logistics activities
                    at the Pentagon, but that becomes difficult. I'll tell you another story. When I
                    first became Deputy Secretary, I took a look at some of our bases and said why
                    do we have [government employees] for firefighters and security guards? Why
                    don't we contract out that function? We could do it cheaper if we contract out.
                    I tried to push contracting those functions out. I think it took two weeks for a
                    bill to go through the Congress preventing us from contracting out firefighters
                    and security guards. If my memory serves me correctly, that bill is still on the
                    books today-that statute is still on the books today. That's the reaction you
                    get on the Hill by doing things that are eminently sensible. Business outsources
                    left and right and saves money doing it. There is no reason the Government
                    shouldn't outsource as well, except for the political resistance you get on the
                    Hill, and to some extent within DOD.</p>
                <p>Q: What about in procurement, what about Congress and it's role in asking you to
                    continue to build C-130s-it may have been some other number, C-130s stick in my
                    mind.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, there was an article on C-130s the other day. Sure. When you're
                    Secretary of Defense, you've got an intense lobby to either continue weapons
                    systems or start up weapons systems, or put weapon systems in a particular
                    district. You just have to continue to fight that. One time when I was deputy
                    secretary, the A-7 aircraft was built in the district of Joe Addabbo, who was
                    chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I went to a Defense Resources Board
                    meeting, which is an internal meeting of the Service Secretaries and the members
                    of the Joint Chiefs and other people from OSD [Office of the Secretary of
                    Defense]. I said, “We're going to stop production of the A-7. It's out of date.
                    We're going to move to production of the A-10.” I literally walked back into my
                    office and within five minutes Joe Addabbo was on the phone saying, “You are not
                    going to stop the production of the A-7. I'm going to force you to continue it.”
                    That's how fast the word spreads up on the Hill on those kinds of issues. But
                    you just have to fight it. That's what you spend a lot of time going. I can
                    remember when I was deputy secretary, one of the things that made sense was to
                    put weapons systems on a multiyear contract. You could bring down costs
                    enormously by doing that. So I sought authority in the Congress for multiyear
                    contracts. Congress did not like to give it, obviously because it meant they
                    lost control on a year to year basis. They wanted control where the money goes,
                    and if you lock in a system over a period of time, it deprives them of some
                    ability to move money around. The principal opponent was Jack Brooks, who you
                    may recall was a very powerful congressman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Government operations.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Government operations committee. I decided the only way to do it was to
                    fight him head on. So I mustered all the forces I could get and took him on and
                    we won on the floor. I went up to see Jack Brooks the next morning. I don't know
                    if you ever met Jack Brooks, but he very tough and sarcastic.</p>
                <p>He looked at me and said, “Carlucci, you son of a bitch. You broughup every
                    contractor you could find to defeat me on this.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Mr. Chairman, if you'd been in my shoes, what would you havdone?”</p>
                <p>He said, “I'd have done the same damn thing.”</p>
                <p>And we became friends. But those are the kinds of things you had tdo.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find being Secretary of Defense? Were you sort of alone? You are
                    sort of the pinnacle. There aren't other departments that you can call on to
                    support you.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I was fortunate that I had the kind of relationship with Bill Crowe
                    where I could talk to him and seek advice. He'd drop into my office to chat. I
                    had superb military assistants, first Air Force general Gordon Fornell, who I'd
                    inherited from Cap. He left after a couple of months. Then I chose Admiral Bill
                    Owens as my military assistant, the man who subsequently went on to become vice
                    chairman of the Joint Chiefs and enjoys, as you know, a sterling reputation.
                    Bill was superb and I could talk to him and get candid advice from him. Then I
                    had, obviously, a very close relationship with Colin Powell who was National
                    Security Advisor. So we could talk. I'll give you an example. When the CINCCENT
                    [Commander in Chief, Central Command] job came open, that's the job in the
                    Middle East, which had been held by a Marine Corps general, now retired. His
                    name was George Christ. The Navy came in and said, “It's their turn to have the
                    Central Command job.” They nominated a man named Hank Mustin. He had a good
                    record. He had some weaknesses but he was obviously a bright man. The
                    institutional forces essentially said, “Its the Navy's turn; give it to the
                    Navy.” And I thought to myself, “Gee, I'm not sure about putting a Naval officer
                    in the job. It seems to me if there is going to be a war over there, it will be
                    a land war.” So I turned to Owens, who was a Naval officer, and I said, “What do
                    you think about this?”</p>
                <p>He said, “I think your reservations are well founded.”</p>
                <p>I talked to Colin Powell and he said, “I think your reservations arwell founded,”
                    as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>So then I asked the Army to submit the names of their best combat generals and
                    one of those names was Norm Schwarzkopf. I read his file in its entirety and I
                    called in Schwarzkopf and spent about I'd say about 45 minutes to an hour with
                    him. I liked him. His was the name that I forwarded to the President instead of
                    the name that the Pentagon wanted. I cite this because you asked a question
                    about loneliness. I did have people that I could sound out like Bill Owens and
                    Colin Powell, who would give me very candid advice, advice that might be
                    different from what the institution would give.</p>
                <p>Q: In mentioning Schwarzkopf... When you talked about the Airbus thing over Iran,
                    how did you view the Persian Gulf situation during your time from '87 to
                    '89?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, that was our biggest crisis. When I became National Security
                    Advisor, one of the first things I did was try and address the Persian Gulf
                    situation. I was essentially the point person in the Kuwaiti Reflagging
                    Operation. Essentially we reflagged Kuwaiti ships so we could provide escorts
                    for them. It was not without its drawbacks. Some people like Mitch McConnell
                    [Republican Senator from Kentucky] argued quite persuasively “How come you are
                    escorting foreign tankers even though they carry the American flag and American
                    owned bottoms carrying foreign flags are not escorted?” The Iranians became more
                    and more aggressive; you may even recall they sent a flotilla to threaten Saudi
                    Arabia. They were harassing ships at an increasing pace. We had already taken
                    out one of their oil platforms. When I came over to the Pentagon, tensions were
                    high. As you know, fighting did in fact, break out. We sank about half the
                    Iranian Navy in about 24 hours. We lost one helicopter. I think there were two
                    people on board. But the casualties on our side were very light. That was an
                    engagement that essentially Bill Crowe and I conducted [from] the operations
                    center in the Pentagon. In fact, there's a couple of stories that are
                    interesting. The Iranians fired on us. We had an airplane in the air and the
                    pilot requested permission to attack. We had to change the rules of engagement
                    to do that. So, I called Colin Powell and I said, “Colin, you need to get the
                    President right away, because I need different rules of engagement in order to
                    retaliate.”</p>
                <p>Colin called the President and got back to me inside of five minutes. That was
                    some kind of record in changing the rules of engagement.</p>
                <p>We then launched a campaign. Every time the Iranians attacked us, we returned
                    fire. Our missiles were extraordinarily accurate. Our laser guided bombs were
                    very accurate. I can remember at one point, there were two Iranian frigates, the
                    Shaban and the Sahan. I get the names mixed up, but one, the Shaban, I think,
                    was sunk and the other one, the Sahan, was dead in the water. The pilot was
                    circling overhead. He had a laser guided bomb that could drop right down the
                    smokestack. No question he would have sunk it. By then we knew we'd won the
                    engagement. Bill Crowe came to me and he said - I think he used to call me “Mr.
                    Secretary” in those days, “I think we've shed enough blood.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Bill, I think you're right. Spare that ship.”</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>You asked about decisions the military didn't like. They didn't like that
                    decision. Maybe it was the wrong decision because I subsequently heard that the
                    ship was back out harassing shipping. It seemed to me to be useless expenditure
                    of life to let that bomb go. So those were lonely decisions that you have to
                    make.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the Airbus incident? You mentioned we had shot down an Airbus
                    thinking it was an Iranian attack and it was a civilian plane. It has often been
                    expressed we didn't make immediate compensation or something to that effect.</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, we did apologize and I think we did offer fair compensation to
                    the families of those on that plane. I'm pretty sure we did. I'm speaking from
                    memory. I of course appointed a Board of Inquiry and spent a lot of time going
                    over the report. In fact Bill Crowe and I flew to Patuxent Naval Air Station
                    where we had a mock up of the Vincennes. He and I reenacted the whole thing. We
                    had people playing the roles of the different participants based on the reports
                    so that we could put ourselves in the mindset of the Captain and the crew
                    members and the state of confusion or semi-confusion that always exists in
                    battle. We concluded that the judgement that the Captain made, the Captain of
                    the Vincennes, was not an unreasonable judgement. He was under attack. You could
                    actually hear the bullets hitting the ship. He didn't have a lot of time to make
                    the decision and when he did, it was terribly unfortunate, of course. But he did
                    warn the aircraft many times. The aircraft was not squawking a civilian
                    indicator at the time, and there were no other indications that it was a
                    civilian aircraft.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall hearing that the Navy was quite unhappy about
                        thflagging situation to begin with, of the Kuwaitis, of the escort
                        duty?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I never sensed that. That first started when Cap was Secretary and I
                    was National Security Advisor. I didn't hear any opposition to that. I just
                    can't comment intelligently on that because nobody ever told me the Navy was
                    unhappy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I could be wrong.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The one thing, the Secretary of the Navy, Jim Webb,resigned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He got really hooked on a 600 ship navy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It wasn't really a 600 ship Navy. As we were taking the Navy down, I
                    said we better take some ships out. There were some frigates that I regarded as
                    eligible for retirement. The budget people essentially supported that decision.
                    Will Taft was in charge of the budget and I told Will to go ahead with that
                    decision. None of us knew that the Navy Secretary felt so strongly about it that
                    he would resign. Certainly he didn't appeal to me. He didn't appeal to Will. If
                    you don't have an appeal on a decision, and you get a resignation over it, it's
                    a bit of a surprise. The resignation letter was sent to the White House and a
                    copy dropped on my desk. That was an unfortunate episode.</p>
                <p>Q: Looking at this '87 to '89 period. You had the Soviet Union moving toward
                    something but I mean it was less menacing and all that. You had this war going
                    on in the Persian Gulf, which is dragging us in and you had problems elsewhere.
                    What were some of the hot spots that you were concerned about?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It was mainly the Gulf and the negotiations with Russia. You always had
                    to worry about Korea. Then on the NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization]
                    front, you had the nagging Greece-Turkey problem. You could never ignore that
                    one. We also had some problems in Africa which were mainly the concern of the
                    State Department - the Mozambique problem and the Angolan problem. The military
                    didn't get too much involved in that. Those were principally the trouble
                    spots.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anybody...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Then we had such issues as low-level flying in Germany. That one became
                    a big political issue. That cost them a minister of defense in Germany. My
                    colleague in Germany had to resign over low-level flying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is training flights?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Training flights. He was supporting us and it was novery good politics
                    for him to do so, so he had to resign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view the French at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, interestingly enough, I never had any problems with the French.
                    The French Defense Minister was Chevenement, who is in the current socialist
                    government as Minister of Interior, is far to the left, but he cooperated. When
                    I wanted help in the Persian Gulf, I appealed to the European allies to put some
                    ships in because our Congress wouldn't sustain our reflagging operation without
                    some of the allies there. The French came in, the Brits came in, the Dutch came
                    in, the Italians came in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any concern about the Iran-Iraq war, about Iraq
                        and thfuture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Of course, we had the Stark incident. That was when I was National
                    Security Advisor. I think the degree of our support for Iraq has been greatly
                    exaggerated. To my recollection the only thing we gave Iraq during that struggle
                    with Iran, the war with Iran, was very rough order of battle information. We did
                    not give them targeting information. And I don't know of any weapons systems
                    that we sold to them. There was some dual use technology that may have gone to
                    them. But the common belief that we sold Iraq weapons during that war I
                    certainly can't sustain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that such a command might need a ground
                        commander.What were you thinking of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I was thinking of either Iraq or Iran. There was also the possibility
                    of some kind of Soviet incursion. Those were the standard scenarios. As I looked
                    around at the nature of the threat, it seemed to me that the land war was much
                    more likely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about China? Was China considered a problem at the
                        time?Were we watching it closely or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: I was fortunate. We enjoyed good relations with China. I made a very
                    successful visit to China [in September 1988]. It was a very strange thing for
                    me, because I'd been in uniform during the Korean War, to sit opposite the
                    Chinese Minister of Defense for one hour, Qin Jiwei, and listen to him tell me
                    about the problems of the People's Liberation Army. We had military exchange
                    programs which produced a very good relationship. We also had managed to balance
                    the Taiwan-China relationship rather well. I'm a little disturbed that that
                    balance may have been altered a bit by some of the comments President Clinton
                    made in Beijing. But we had good relations with Taiwan. I, of course, didn't
                    visit Taiwan at the time, but we did give them some frigates. China was not the
                    kind of “concern” that it is today.</p>
                <p>Q: Sometimes a military force almost has to have somebody to build against.
                    During the time you were there, was their the feeling that the Soviets were
                    slipping?</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well first, yes, during negotiations it became clear that they didn't
                    have the kind of capability that we thought they'd had. They certainly had a lot
                    of weapons. That we always know. But where the weaknesses emerge were the
                    capabilities of their troops. I can remember Akrimayoff, the Soviet Chief of
                    Staff, when he came over as Bill Crowe's guest, called on me before he went back
                    and I said, “Marshall, what did you find to be the most impressive thing during
                    your visit to the United States?”He hesitated a minute and said, “The quality of
                    your non-commissioned officers. We don't have that kind of quality.” And that's
                    true. If you look at the then Soviet structure, the Russian structure today,
                    they've got officers doing jobs that our noncoms [non-commissioned officers] do.
                    That's because they've got a conscript army and navy. We began to observe those
                    weaknesses. We also began to clarify a lot of misunderstandings. The Soviets
                    were deluding themselves. They were paranoid. That paranoia came through loud
                    and clear. I can remember one discussion with Yazov where he kept producing a
                    map that showed the Soviet Union surrounded by the West, and including bases in
                    South Africa. He kept saying we were poised for attack.</p>
                <p>I said, “Come on, General Yazov, you know that NATO has no offensive
                    capabilities. It's a defensive force. We're not threatening the Soviet
                    Union.</p>
                <p>He finally said, Maybe you aren't but somebody else is.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well who?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, Japan.”</p>
                <p>I almost fell out of my chair.</p>
                <p>On another occasion when I was getting briefed at the Voroshilov Military Academy
                    by Akrimayoff and his people, they pulled down a map and they had the blue
                    arrows of NATO striking at the heart of the Soviet Union. And I looked at one
                    arrow and it had Danish forces advancing to the Polish border in something like
                    20 days.</p>
                <p>I said, “You can't be serious.”</p>
                <p>These were the kinds of things they would produce, and you never knew whether
                    they believed them or not. I gave a lecture to 200 of the top Soviet generals
                    and admirals at the Voroshilov Military Academy and I told them how their force
                    structure was offensive in nature, and ask why they were spending so much of
                    their GNP on military.</p>
                <p>One of them asked me, “How come you know so much about us?”</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>I said, “Well, we have to observe what we can from satellites and other
                    information and we convert it back into dollars to see what you are doing. I'll
                    tell you what, it would be a lot easier if you'd publish your information just
                    like we do.”</p>
                <p>And the place broke out in laughter. I asked my military escort, a man named
                    Shabanov, afterwards, “Why did they laugh?” He said, “You don't understand. What
                    you said went to the very heart of our system - secrecy. They don't understand
                    anything but secrecy.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left this job in January 1989, what was the thing
                        yofelt most pleased about as far as what you'd accomplished?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: Well, I think several things. I think the negotiations with the Soviet
                    Union and the military-to-military contacts. The avoidance of dangerous
                    incidents. Those were, I think, significant achievements. The fact that we began
                    to attack the infrastructure and turnaround the budget, the successful Middle
                    East policies. I had done some useful things more as Deputy Secretary than as
                    Secretary in the procurement area. I also had to, as you know, had to manage the
                    Ill Wind scandal. That broke three days after I took the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The what scandal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: The Ill Wind procurement scandal. Remember “the biggest procurement
                    scandal in the Pentagon's history?”Q: Oh, yes. Could you explain what it
                    was?</p>
                <p>CARLUCCI: It was about three days after I was in the job. Ed Meese asked to come
                    see me. He came over and said, “In one hour we're going to announce the largest
                    procurement scandal in history.”</p>
                <p>I said, “What? I don't know anything about it. Nobody briefed me.” The Inspector
                    General later told me she decided not to brief me because it wouldn't be in my
                    interest to know about all this. “Thank you very much,” I thought. When the
                    scandal broke, Les Aspen called for a freeze on all contracts. All hell broke
                    loose on the Hill. This is a question of kickbacks and all kinds of illegal
                    payments. I guess a number of people went to jail. I can't recall exactly how
                    many. I had to work through that at the same time as I was working through these
                    other things.</p>
