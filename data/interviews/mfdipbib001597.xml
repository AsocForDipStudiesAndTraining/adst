                <p>Interviewed by: Jewell FenziInitial interview date: July 11, 2008</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Jewell Fenzi on Friday, July 11, 2008. I am
                        interviewing Tessa McBride for the AAFSW Spouse Oral History Program, and we
                        are recording this interview at the Woman's National Democratic Club. The
                        first question I always ask someone is where did you meet your husband.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: I met him here in Washington; I was teaching school in Charlottesville.
                    I just came for a year, and then stayed on. The first summer vacation, I toured
                    around the States with a friend. And the second summer, which was basically
                    three months, June, July, and August, I thought it would be interesting to come
                    to Washington. One of my former colleagues at the school where I'd taught had
                    become a State Department interpreter and lived in D.C.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The school here, or in England?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: In Charlottesville, where I taught for 3 years in the end. So my friend
                    was going to be working for the State Department that summer, taking
                    international visitors round the country, which meant that I could sublet her
                    apartment in Georgetown. She was dating another interpreter, who, in turn, was
                    sharing an apartment with Ed. [laughter] So that's how we met!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then, how did you come over to Charlottesville? Was
                        that on some program, or did you come on your own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: On my own. My father was an army officer, but he spent the whole war in
                    prison camp. He was captured at Dunkirk. As a result, his health wasn't very
                    good after the war, so he basically had a desk job in London. However, I was
                    sent to a boarding-school for army officers' daughters, and all my friends went
                    — at that time, still the days of empire, more or less — so they went literally
                    all over the world, and I was determined as soon as I graduated I would start
                    traveling. I must admit I've done even better than I thought! [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Surpassed expectations! [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Absolutely. Ed was not a foreign service officer when we got
                    married.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you didn't know what you were getting into.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how long did it take him to decide to go, what, with
                        USIS, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Yes. He was working for USIA. He was working in the exhibits division; I
                    can't remember the details, but a lot of the programs in which he was going to
                    be most interested were going to be transferred to either The Smithsonian or the
                    International Visitors Program, which meant that if he wanted to continue with
                    exhibits, it would be more interesting for him to be working overseas. Since he
                    had passed, sometime earlier, the written foreign service exam, he went ahead
                    and did the rest of it, which, as far as I know, basically meant going for an
                    interview. I didn't know anything about the fact that he'd reapplied, but for a
                    brief period, during the Vietnam War, they interviewed spouses as well as
                    prospective foreign service officers. Or perhaps it was just foreign-born
                    spouses. Anyway, I had to go for an interview with him, I think, really, to make
                    sure I wasn't going to get out and demonstrate against the war [laughter], which
                    people were doing at this point. And the interview was actually a dreadful
                    experience, because they were interviewing both of us, and one of the things
                    they asked was — I can still remember — what event of literary importance
                    occurred in 1862, or 1863.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here in the United States, or internationally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Here in the United States. And Ed didn't know the answer; I was dying to
                    fill in with bright chat, but that was not appropriate. It turns out that
                    whatever the date was, during or just before the Civil War, it was Walt
                    Whitman's publication of Leaves of Grass. And, fortunately, Ed redeemed himself
                    by immediately quoting from Leaves of Grass. Anyway, he passed the interview,
                    obviously. So did I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, I would have said — except I don't know when it was
                        written — Uncle Tom's Cabin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Exactly. And I can't remember now . . . . The trouble is I can't
                    remember the date the interviewers gave. Obviously it was the 1860s, but Ed did
                    say something like “it wasn't Uncle Tom's Cabin,” which miraculously he knew the
                    date of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'll have to read Leaves of Grass. Was this when
                        Walt Whitman was . . . . Well, yes, he was a nurse. He was a Civil War
                        nurse. That must have had something to do . . . . Oh, dear.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: I'm afraid I know very little about Leaves of Grass. I have read it, but
                    I think the date must have been the late 1860s, because it was after Lincoln's
                    assassination. Because “O Captain, my Captain, our fearful trip is done,” is in
                    it. t doesn't seem frightfully important. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were married here, or in London?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: We were married in England, near London.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And went where after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: We came back here for a year because Ed hadn't applied to the foreign
                    service. I returned to a job which I had taken at GW Medical School. Not
                    teaching at all. We were then assigned to Lagos, which was fine; we were
                    supposed to leave in August, I think. But I can still remember Ed phoning me at
                    the medical school and saying, would you mind going to Paris instead?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter] An academic question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Well, not really, because we were full of enthusiasm and helping the
                    world, as you know. However, I said, no, I didn't mind going to Paris.
                    [laughter] So that was our first post. But I wasn't an American citizen.
                    Actually, although Ed was meant to be there yesterday, so to speak, our
                    departure was a bit held up because I had to take the oath of citizenship. But
                    once that had been achieved, we went off to Paris. [pause]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you had to be an American citizen before you could go
                        overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: That's right. So I took the oath of citizenship. We'd given up our
                    apartment by that time—the timing was that tight. We were living in an apartment
                    that we were subletting from a friend on Capitol Hill; I can still remember that
                    basement apartment. The rats at night would run along inside the heat vents
                    making the most thunderous noise, so I was quite glad to leave there and go to
                    Paris _____. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so what did you find in Paris? Where did you live, and
                        what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: The first thing was to find an apartment; we had to find it on our own,
                    which was true for USIA in most posts we went to, except for hardship posts. I
                    had done French for university entrance, but my French was literary French,
                    basically, and I didn't know things like “how is the electricity supplied?” or
                    “where do we put our garbage?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what year was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: We arrived in 1967. Our allowance was $300 a month, or the equivalent in
                    French francs, which seemed a fortune to us, but turned out, of course . . . .
                    [laughter] Allowances are never overgenerous, but it was very hard to find an
                    apartment for $300. I would get up early each morning to buy the local paper and
                    look at the ads, because if you didn't get there pretty quickly and say, yes, we
                    want this apartment, you lost it. But anyway, after quite a search, we found a
                    lovely apartment. A beautiful apartment, actually, in the Septi�me, where we
                    spent three wonderful years in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do there? How did you fill your hours?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: The first thing I did was to go to a French course for foreigners, at
                    the Sorbonne, which was very worthwhile. It was both spoken French and quite a
                    lot of French literature, and you had to write essays and things, too. But it
                    obviously did a lot for my French. Then I did a French cookery course at the — I
                    can't remember what it was. It was attached to the Sorbonne also, and the course
                    was in French. It was really for French students, or the wives of students at
                    the Sorbonne, and it was how to cook economical meals. So that was very good,
                    both for my French and my knowledge of markets and French cookery, and so on and
                    so forth. I did some volunteer work for an organization called Toc H. Toc H was
                    a British semi-religious organization, which helped French widows who had been
                    married to British officers. In many cases, the widows were very elderly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was World War II.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: It was World War II, but some of them must, in fact, have been World War
                    I widows. They had a pittance of a pension and were often living in small garret
                    rooms and quite sort of isolated. So they wanted visitors who could help them in
                    little ways. The person I visited most wanted, for instance, a warm dressing
                    gown, which I brought her. Most of the members of Toc H were quite elderly,
                    too—mostly my mother's generation rather than my own. But it was just an
                    interesting group of people to get to know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was it called Toc H?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Isn't it awful? I don't know! I can't remember! [laughter] The symbol
                    was a little sort of night lamp. It had been started at some point before World
                    War II by a British man, who was very closely affiliated with the Anglican
                    church. I think his first name, it must has been his nickname, was Bunty
                    something, but I've forgotten the details of the organization. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe we can Google it and find out a little about
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: Then the thing that took up most of my time was that I was very
                    interested in historical demography at university, and always thought that at
                    some point I would go back and do graduate work — historical demographics to
                    study who died of what, and things like the birth rates and death rates, and so
                    on and so forth. There is a very good department at the Sorbonne for that. So I
                    went to l'�cole Pratique des Hautes �tudes, the Practical School for Higher
                    Studies, and studied historical demography. The program was really a small
                    weekly seminar. But then you also did research work for the professor, who was a
                    very eminent demographer called Professor Henri. I, of course, was the only
                    foreigner in the group of about seven or eight students, and that was enormously
                    interesting. However, this all came to a sudden end because of the �v�nements,
                    the '68 riots in Paris, which shut down Paris for a while, but basically began
                    at the Sorbonne. So the Sorbonne was taken over by the students, and all classes
                    stopped. By the time the seminars resumed, the following fall, I was pregnant,
                    but it was a difficult pregnancy, so I couldn't continue the studies. That, in a
                    sense, leads on to the historical events part, because Ed had an amazing job,
                    assistant cultural attach� mainly for the performing arts. The Cultural Section
                    in Paris at that time was vast. There was an Education Section. There was a
                    deputy cultural attach�, and there were about four or five assistant cultural
                    attach�s. The performing arts job was extraordinary. One of the things he had to
                    do was help or escort prominent American people or an American company in the
                    performing arts if they came to Paris.</p>

                <p>McBRIDE: I don't know if he was the control officer, but I suppose he was. In
                    many cases, the Americans didn't really need much help. But it meant that we
                    would go to some amazing events, sometimes the performances and special
                    receptions afterwards, given either by the ambassador or by the French. One of
                    these events was, as it happened, the night the students took over the Od�on,
                    which is where the movement began. The Paul Taylor dance company was performing,
                    so we went to the performance, left the Th�atre de l'Od�on, and went off with
                    the company. Our host was the director of the Od�on and we were all in a nice
                    restaurant nearby when somebody came to tell the director that the students had
                    taken over the Od�on. So everybody said, oh, yes, without realizing how
                    important this was. The deputy director, Monsieur Giacomoni, a charming man whom
                    we knew well, tried to persuade them to leave. Eventually Jean Louis Barrault,
                    the director, also tried to persuade them to go but they wouldn't leave, and
                    that's how the 68 revolution started, and we were right there! [laughter]
                    However, the problem, culturally, from the American point of view, was that, of
                    course, the company couldn't continue to perform. In addition to which, Paul
                    Taylor fell somewhere and broke his leg, so he was going round in plaster of
                    Paris and could do very little. I think he probably cursed the �v�nements and
                    everything that happened. [laughter] Paris gradually became more and more shut
                    down. It was extraordinary, actually, because all the public transport stopped,
                    so if you wanted to go anywhere that wasn't within walking distance, you just
                    had to hail an army truck, because army trucks would come along occasionally at
                    specific places. I only did that once, because we were within walking distance
                    of most places. But you never really felt any physical danger. We thought it
                    would be interesting to see a riot underway. We could hear on the news, of
                    course, exactly what was happening and where, so one night, we went off—we had
                    listened to the news and found out exactly where the riots were going on —
                    generally in the Latin Quarter — so we went. Obviously, it wasn't a good time to
                    be arrested by the police or anything, so we kept our distance. But I can still
                    remember the smoky haze and the barricades and people hurling rocks, which you
                    could pick up from the street because the streets were all paved with those
                    little cobbles. Not quite cobbles, but something similar. There were very few
                    places where you could go to buy food, because the trucks couldn't bring
                    vegetables and other things into Paris. Also we had a car, which we were a bit
                    nervous about, because we'd gone into debt to buy it. It was a new car and we
                    didn't want it to be burnt up on a barricade. But one day we went down to the
                    Quinzi�me, where there were several car factories — I can't remember exactly
                    which factories — but it was amazing, because the streets were more or less
                    empty, but hanging everywhere were black anarchist flags and the red communist
                    flags. It was like being in another country. It was extraordinary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what did you do with your car?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Oh, the car! We bravely parked on the street, but we were not in the
                    Latin Quarter and so that made it less risky. And the car was fine. [laughter]
                    We occasionally used it, but obviously, we didn't take it anywhere near a
                    riot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, it was really localized disturbance. It wasn't . . .
                        .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Yes, but it affected the whole city for all the reasons that . . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you could still move around, but you were careful
                        where you went.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: You could still move around on foot or by army truck, or if you had gas,
                    by car. It was hugely embarrassing to the French, for all kinds of reasons, but
                    one of the reasons it was embarrassing — it seemed strange for 1968 — but at any
                    rate, the first talks between the Americans and the Vietnamese were taking
                    place, some sort of preliminary talks, and that meant that there was a good deal
                    of press coverage. But, of course, the city was still closed down even though
                    the talks were taking place. One of the magical experiences for me at that time
                    took place when Ed was on all-night duty at the Press Center. The whole of USIA
                    had to take turns. Sometimes the only way I could see him in 24 or more hours
                    would be to go, when he had a brief time off, to have an evening meal with him.
                    So one Sunday evening, when he was on particularly long duty, I walked from our
                    apartment to the embassy, which took about thirty minutes. To get to USIS, which
                    was near the Place de la Concorde in the rue Saint Florentin, I had to cross the
                    Place de la Concorde. It was sunset, and it was so beautiful. There was no
                    traffic. It was simply extraordinary to see that amazing place quite empty with
                    no traffic, and just its wonderful buildings set against the pink sky. As you
                    can see, I can still remember it almost forty years later. That was magical.
                    Apart from a feeling of uncertainty, and a bit of trouble finding food and milk
                    and things, you never really felt threatened. And that was the year — I think
                    I'm right in saying — that both Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were
                    assassinated. One felt how extraordinary and sad it was that there was actually
                    far more mayhem, in a way, in Paris, but unlike America it wasn't
                    life-threatening. So all this is how I filled my time. I kept on with most
                    activities once I was pregnant, but, as I mentioned, it wasn't an easy
                    pregnancy, and from six months onwards, I was confined to the apartment, which I
                    hated! [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, of course you did! Now, at that time, it didn't help
                        being so close to England that you could have gone home? You didn't want
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: No, because actually, it was all quite sudden. I'd been told I had to be
                    careful, and I'd been extremely anxious to be pregnant. I went to the doctor one
                    day. He was a very fierce doctor, a brilliant doctor, but none of the sort of
                    pleasant charm that one associated with American gynecologists or obstetricians
                    at the time. And my French doctor said, “You must go home. You must go straight
                    to bed. You mustn't leave the apartment. You're just to stay in the apartment,
                    and you're to do this now!” [laughter]</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For three months.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: This was at six months. I was very cross, because the next day we'd been
                    invited to go to Versailles by the deputy director, to have a private tour
                    before it was open to the public. We were going with a friend who was an opera
                    singer, who had, I think, arranged that we would have this special tour. I can't
                    remember whether she was coming, too. But at any rate, we would literally have
                    been able to bounce on the beds and not subject to any of the normal
                    limitations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, wonderful!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: They'll open drawers for you, and let you see and touch anything you
                    want. So, I wailed to Dr. Bazin, “but can't I go to Versailles tomorrow!?”
                    [laughter] And he said, “Certainly not!” So, I missed that. I missed a lot. But
                    for the last couple of weeks before the nine months, he said it was fine to go
                    out. So I took advantage of absolutely every opportunity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why the change?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Well, because if she'd been born at six months, she'd have been too
                    small, but by eight-and-a-half months it was fine. And, in fact, she was nine
                    pounds, two ounces, when she was born. So that was all right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, a very healthy baby. But those must have been three
                        difficult months. You must have read a lot.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: I read a lot. Sometimes, friends came to visit. I pottered around the
                    apartment a lot. When I was a small girl, I spent a lot of time being taught to
                    sew and embroider very beautifully, which actually hasn't been all that
                    practical. But at that time, I was still doing embroidery and sewing and so on.
                    For example, I made my own maternity dresses and things. So when confined to the
                    apartment, I made some crib hangings, and some maternity dresses, and knitted
                    baby clothes, as well. No television. I just remember being rather frustrated
                    and cross, but obviously not wanting to have the baby too early.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is before the 1970's directive. Was USIS making any
                        demands on you as a spouse? Yes, and no? [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: OH Yes! The PAO's wife was a fabulous woman, whom we still see
                    occasionally, called Mary Brady. And Mary Brady is great fun, but was able to
                    call on us from time to time. But she could laugh about some of the things we
                    were called upon to do. And I don't think it was always Mary who was asking us
                    to do them. There were three ambassadors while we were there. We began with
                    Ambassador Bohlen, and that was very much old-fashioned foreign service. . . . I
                    feel very fortunate, in a way, to have seen the old foreign service as it soon
                    ceased to exist. However, under the Bohlens, if you were invited to an event at
                    the embassy, you had to arrive, I think, twenty minutes beforehand, not a minute
                    earlier, not a minute later. And Mary had written to me and said I must bring a
                    hat to make my calls. Well, we had no money.... .the main reason we had
                    absolutely no money was that we had put all our savings into the down-payment on
                    a house. It was so irresponsible, in a way — when we bought the house, if they
                    had asked us for another twenty-cent stamp more, we'd have had to say no!
                    [laughter] We sold everything. We sold the car. We sold my hairpiece. We sold
                    everything we could! [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that the house you're living in now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: No, we've moved once since. [laughter] However, I'm a believer in large
                    hats that make a statement if you have to wear one. When we had to buy this
                    damned hat, Ed had allowed me twenty dollars to buy it, but I've got a big head,
                    which was a problem, too. Eventually, I had to buy a hat at Lord and Taylor's,
                    more expensive than some of the little hat shops that then existed down at F and
                    G Streets. I didn't want him to know I'd gone over the twenty-dollar limit. So,
                    in the end, I remember writing a check for twenty dollars, and then paying the
                    rest in cash, which must have looked very odd! [laughter] So, we arrived in
                    Paris, and Mary asked me if I'd brought a hat. And I said, “oh, yes, I quite
                    like the hat.” And she said, “but it doesn't have a brim, does it! [laughter]
                    You're not allowed to wear a hat without a brim to call on Mrs. Bohlen!”
                    [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: So I was very cross, but fortunately, my mother either sent me a hat, or
                    I somehow borrowed one. People wore hats all the time in England. They still
                    wear them much more than here. And my mother also had a big head, so she lent me
                    a hat to make this call. Section heads arranged for new arrivals to go to the
                    Residence — lots of us were there because the embassy was so large — and section
                    heads arranged for each wife in turn, to sit on the sofa to talk to Mrs. Bohlen.
                    You were instructed ahead of time which side of Mrs. Bohlen you had to sit on —
                    it was either the left or the right — and it was a big no-no if you sat on the
                    wrong side. So Mary shepherded me to the correct side and I talked to Mrs.
                    Bohlen for a little while. I don't know what about. She was very pleasant, and I
                    wondered afterwards: Was this a mystique that was built around people like the
                    Bohlens, or did they really want all these rules followed? Anyway, so you had to
                    make the call. And you had to have a big supply of engraved calling cards. And
                    there was a special way that you had to put your husband's card and the Mr. and
                    Mrs. cards, which had to be left not only on Mrs. Bohlen, but on all the section
                    chiefs' wives, as well; but fortunately, you didn't have to go and call on them.
                    You did everything with the call on Mrs. Bohlen at the residence. All the
                    section chiefs' wives were very pleasant and lively. I clearly remember some of
                    their comments. A lot of them have, sadly, since died, but they were basically
                    fun. And Mary is huge fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this was the late 1960s, after the cultural revolution
                        here, and everything. So your section (heads?) must have been rather young
                        people, in their forties, or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Well, I suppose so. I don't really know. The youngest, I think, was
                    Phyllis Funkhouser . . . . No, the youngest was definitely Mary, because it was
                    a second marriage. I hazard a guess, but the next youngest must probably have
                    been — I'm on very shaky ground here — [laughter] a very lively person called
                    Phyllis Funkhouser, — sadly, both she and her husband recently died. From Paris,
                    I think he went as ambassador to somewhere in Africa. When I was congratulating
                    her, but muttering vaguely about Africa going to be quite a cross to bear, she
                    said, I don't mind! I just move everywhere with my ashtray! That's the essential
                    part of my airfreight! [laughter] Nothing more is vital(?). Actually, some were
                    quite a lot older. The DCM's wife was a lot older, but I can't remember her
                    name. So anyway, after a year with the Bohlens, then the Shrivers arrived. And
                    the Shrivers wanted to change things and appeal to youth. Oh, the other thing
                    about the Bohlens was, if you went to a cocktail party, everybody on the embassy
                    staff who was invited, had to wait outside the gate. And, of course, all the
                    section chiefs seemed very formidable and important to me, at the time. I still
                    remember being amazed. The first time we went, all these senior people were
                    standing there, coordinating their watches, to say, is it ten past six? Or isn't
                    it ten past six? [laughter] Because we must go in exactly twenty minutes before
                    6:30. It just seemed totally ridiculous to me. All the women had to have hats
                    and gloves, too. So, when the exact time was agreed upon, we would all pour in.
                    Once again, was this the Bohlens' rule, or was it just something that somebody
                    had decided should be done?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It probably was written somewhere in the protocol of the
                        embassy, and Mrs. Bohlen, of course, was Mrs. Foreign Service to any number
                        of people. I knew her here in Washington, briefly, as a very young spouse,
                        and she was charming. She was very nice to us. Now, of course, we weren't in
                        an embassy situation. We were in the AAFSW. She was around when that was
                        founded, and, you know, supported it. But she very much was old school,
                        definitely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: The only other people that — I didn't know them at all but much later
                    on, about thirty years later on, when we were assigned to London, we met Mrs.
                    Bruce, who was apparently the same. Mrs. Bruce, who had retired — I think she
                    lived in England full-time . . . . Anyway, when I met her, she was sitting on a
                    cushion [laughter] at some country fair, surrounded by vegetables, which she was
                    selling for some worthy cause [laughter]. I.e. no longer Mrs. Foreign
                    Service</p>

                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: And she was charming. And we went off to lunch with her, for some
                    reason. We must have been with friends who knew her. And I thought, well
                    goodness! I wonder whether she was like Mrs. Bohlen as an ambassador's wife! And
                    Mrs. Bohlen seemed absolutely charming in my encounter with her, mainly on the
                    sofa, for my call.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Someone like the Shrivers could come in, and they could
                        throw all of that over because of who they were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Oh, but it was shocking! The French were still — I think still are —
                    more formal than the Americans; and, of course, they were used to the Bohlens'
                    regime. The Shrivers also wanted to invite a totally different group of people,
                    in particular, young people. And I think anybody under — I think the cutoff age
                    must have been under forty — At any rate, Ed was supposed to supply a list on, I
                    think, a quarterly basis of all the people he had met under a certain age, and
                    could actually call up and chat with. They had to be under thirty-five or under
                    forty or something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another set of rules! [laughter</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: It wasn't that easy to meet lots of French people under thirty-five or
                    forty, or whatever it was. But anyway, he had to supply a list, or was supposed
                    to. So, the Shrivers were quite different. And if you went to a reception — I
                    suppose we were all still used to arriving at whatever the requisite time was .
                    . . . But once you arrived at the reception, at one point the Shriver children,
                    who were all quite small . . . . [laughter] I can still remember they got the
                    silver salvers from the butlers who were passing the cocktail canap�s out, and
                    they rolled them amongst the legs of the guests, many of whom were sort of old
                    school and were quite surprised, if not horrified! [laughter]. Anyway, the
                    Shrivers were fantastic. Because they were very interested in cultural affairs,
                    Ed was very much involved. And they were interested in updating America's image.
                    And at the time, in the late '60s, America was regarded as predominant in the
                    field of contemporary dance, art, etc. A lot of contemporary American artists
                    whose names are very well known today were shown at art exhibitions. There were
                    frequent dance performances. Perhaps under Sargent Shriver's auspices, Porgy and
                    Bess came to Paris, and was performed there — I don't know how many
                    performances, but several performances — and then toured the whole country. And
                    it was a colossal success. Then, not to concentrate entirely on the
                    mid-twentieth century, the Shrivers also organized a midnight mass at the
                    Sainte-Chappelle, which hadn't been used for a service since the French
                    Revolution, I think. Anyway, a very long time. So they brought in an organ and
                    they brought in chairs, and made sure that the music was topnotch. Ed was
                    responsible for organizing a great many of these events, so we attended them.
                    Yet, they were enormously considerate people to work for. I remember Ed, at one
                    point, getting into the bath — he was very tired after some major visit — and
                    saying, “I don't care who calls. If the ambassador calls, I'm not available
                    [laughter]. I'm not getting out of the tub.” Sure enough, the phone rings. If he
                    was calling you on the weekend or in the evenings, Sargent Shriver didn't
                    necessarily use a secretary. So it would be, “Hi, this is Sarge Shriver!”
                    [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is Ed there? [laughter] Yes sir! [laughter] Is Ed
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Ed got out of the tub. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Indeed. Indeed.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: But, obviously, we were lucky to attend a lot of these events (?). . . .
                    By this time I was pregnant again. We were clever enough to have two babies in
                    fifty-four weeks, but this was fine. But this time I went to everything, and the
                    Shrivers were so considerate. They had a reception after the midnight mass — and
                    we had to go to the reception, although I think I, in view of my condition, I
                    could have opted out. But I didn't particularly want to, so we were up until
                    about three, but, of course, that was three in the morning of Christmas Day, and
                    we wanted to visit my mother in England. My mother was a widow and lived on her
                    own. So, the Shrivers said, “oh, we'll send our car and driver to collect you
                    and then you can go straight to the airport.” So we had this astonishing sort of
                    presidential-type limousine to go to the airport, with the first baby, our
                    daughter Sarah. We rather ruined the image as we swept up to the airport when I
                    sort of stumbled out with a huge bag of disposable nappies, or something, which
                    I dropped. [laughter] But the Shrivers were enormously thoughtful. When
                    Charlotte, our second daughter, was born, they wrote and congratulated us, which
                    they did for al new parents. Although you had to be available, or Ed had to be
                    available literally twenty-four hours a day, they were very considerate and very
                    grateful and thanked you. And Eunice is a fabulous woman. She was very much in
                    touch with most of the embassy wives. If there was any crisis, she would be
                    amongst the first to go and try to do anything she could to help. They were in
                    many ways, amongst the most considerate ambassadors that we've ever served
                    under.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: But the third ambassador was a complete contrast again. I don't know if
                    the Shrivers actually encouraged (?) this, but anyway, Ed started growing his
                    hair quite long, not down to the shoulders, or anything. But then Ambassador
                    Watson arrived. By this time we knew we were going to go to Senegal . . . .
                    Ambassador Watson's first directive was that everybody had to have short hair —
                    men had to have their hair above their collars and they must all have proper
                    haircuts. Well, this hadn't been the Shrivers' style at all. Ed said, “I'm not
                    going to cut my hair. I just won't do it.” [laughter] He's very difficult to
                    shift once he's made up his mind about something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How close to the end of your French tour were you
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: This must have been about three months before we left. So anyway, Ed
                    never did cut his hair, but then it was collar and tie, and there was some
                    directive about the kind of shirt that the men were supposed to wear, white I
                    think. I keep saying men, because there weren't many female foreign service
                    then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was Mr. Watson?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: He was the director of IBM. He got into trouble, I think, during his
                    assignment to Paris. I think he was groping the air hostesses on the plane, or
                    something. I can't remember. This may be entire gossip. There was some sort of
                    scandal, but obviously, long after we left. Paris was astonishing because of the
                    cultural experiences and the people we met. We knew the Menuhins pretty well.
                    And Ed knew Leontyne Price pretty well. We never had another post like that. His
                    last overseas post was London, but by that time there just wasn't this enormous
                    interest in American cultural events. And anyway, there was almost no budget for
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just going to say money.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Oh, one extraordinary event in was that President Nixon, during the
                    Shrivers' time — this was part of this historical event — came to Paris to meet
                    with President de Gaulle, and that was astonishing on many different levels. One
                    thing involved Mrs. Shriver, who is a delightful person, but a formidable
                    character. She's charming and kind, but I probably wouldn't want to get into an
                    argument with her. An advance team came. When you went into the residence, one
                    of the rooms was a big sort of entrance hall; and, I think, to the right — I
                    can't remember exactly — there was a big grand piano. On the piano were photos
                    of her family, which, of course, included lots of Kennedy photos, including her
                    late brother (John Kennedy). I think this must have been before Robert Kennedy
                    was assassinated. Anyway, they must have been quite newly arrived. I can't
                    remember the date. The advance team said, all the photos must go! [laughter]
                    Again, can President Nixon have been aware of this? But the photos went! She
                    took them all away. Ed had got the Menuhins to come because Yehudi Menuhin at
                    the time was an American citizen. I believe later, in order to receive a
                    knighthood in the U.K., he may have renounced his citizenship. I don't know what
                    happened. Anyway, he was definitely an American citizen, which was news, in
                    fact, to anyone British, because he'd lived in England for years. So I didn't
                    know he was American. [laughter] Anyway he came, and he liked to have as
                    accompanist, his sister, Hephzibah Menuhin, who was both American and married to
                    an American; they played together fabulously. But Hephzibah would arrive quite
                    late — we later learned, I suppose because we went to other performances. . .
                    She regarded her main work as helping her husband with the settlement program
                    that he ran in the Chicago area. So, being Yehudi's accompanist was, to
                    Hephzibah, just not the most important thing in her life. But the thing that was
                    very, very lucky for Ed, but totally unknown to him at first, was that during
                    World War II, the Menuhins had been the first people to give a concert, a
                    benefit concert, for the Free French, in London. So, after they finished
                    playing, de Gaulle got up and gave Menuhin this great big bear hug, and said,
                    “mon ami!” [laughter] So, the Nixons and de Gaulle seemed to get along very
                    well. Once again, the protocol for an embassy wife, surrounding all this, was
                    absolutely amazing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Pat Nixon come, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: Yes, she did-at least, I think she did. But I can just remember the
                    President de Gaulle giving Menuhin this great big hug. And this was one of the
                    occasions when there was no rolling of the salvers by the Shriver children.
                    [laughter]</p>

                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: And everything was very, very formal. So, anyway, from there . . . . Is
                    this the order that you'd like to do it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, I think we think that way in our foreign
                        service careers. You know, from Paris you went to Senegal. Yes. Or however.
                        Just fine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Well, then we went to Senegal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But let me just ask you. You never really felt that the
                        embassy made any undue demands on you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Yes, there was all the business of going to things you were supposed to
                    go to, but there were also mainly cookery demands. One of the things . . . . At
                    some point the budget was very low for USIS and they were supposed to give a
                    great big party for something. It was in the cultural center. And Mary said, “We
                    don't have enough money to supply booze. We're going to make this punch.” They
                    were expecting several hundred people, a very large number of people. And we
                    mixed up the punch in great big vats and it was horrid, actually, because there
                    was some fruit base.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it have alcohol in the punch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: It had some alcohol in the punch. It must have had. I can't remember
                    what went into it, but I remember feeling how terribly sticky I felt. [laughter]
                    I think it must have had some cut-up fruit in it, too but, it wasn't nearly as
                    strong as sangria. We made barrels, barrels of this stuff! [laughter] It must
                    have taken several hours. Then the reception came and people drank hardly any of
                    it. [laughter] There were masses left over. {laughter]. So that was one cookery
                    demand, and then . . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they freeze it for another time, or did they toss

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: I'm afraid I don't know what happened to it. Everybody was given several
                    bottles of it, and we brought several bottles home. I don't know what we did
                    with it. I expect we drank some of it, because I'm a sort of “waste not” person.

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And she was on good terms with all of you, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Yes. Anyway, for another occasion somebody decided that . . . . This
                    must have actually have come from the ambassador's office, although, once again,
                    I doubt if it came from Eunice Shriver, or if it did, I am sure she didn't
                    realize how much work it was! [laughter] It was a party for George Washington's
                    birthday, I think. Anyway, it was something to do with an anniversary of George
                    Washington. The decision was that what would be served would be things that
                    George Washington himself might have served at Mt. Vernon. So, everybody was
                    left on their own to do this, which seemed so odd. I was asked to bring two
                    kinds of cookies, or maybe I decided to bring those. Anyway, sweet things that
                    Washington might have served. I found one recipe that was a contemporary recipe
                    of Washington's. Then I cheated for the second kind: I found another one that
                    was sort of mid-nineteenth century and I thought “oh, what the hell, nobody will
                    notice.” [laughter] So I made these perfectly terrible cookies that were Martha
                    Washington's cookies, apparently. There was some problem with yeast or the flour
                    they used, so the cookies were like lead! [laughter] But the punch! Ed found a
                    Mount Vernon recipe for the punch, and the punch was absolutely the most
                    alcoholic thing I think I have ever drunk. The food didn't go down that well,
                    but the drink went down very well. Of course, at the time, one literally didn't
                    know about not smoking and drinking and so on if you were pregnant. I didn't
                    smoke anyway. But I remember thinking this is the strongest, most delicious
                    punch I have ever had in my life, and I probably had several glasses of it. They
                    gave us all the leftovers to take home, and Ed said, “Never mind, we'll make
                    trifle with your cookies.” Well, the cookies sat in the punch without absorbing
                    the liquid [laughter]they just sat there! Anyway, we were asked to do things
                    like that, and I've only described the most amusing ones. But, as you say, one
                    didn't mind. And also at the time, wives weren't allowed to work, so one wasn't
                    trying to juggle the schedule. As you'll have gathered, I had quite a lot of
                    other activities, and I carried on with the research even though I didn't go on
                    to the Sorbonne.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever do anything with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Well, yes. Much later on I came back here and embarked on a Ph.D. at the
                    University of Maryland. But just when I got to the stage where I was to start
                    writing my thesis, Ed was assigned to Bucharest, and it seemed more important to
                    learn Romanian than to do the research. And I never got my doctorate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the Ph.D.'s out there waiting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Yes, and now I don't mind any more. I think this is a big problem for
                    the foreign service in that then — much less so now — but at the time people
                    were far more interested in who the foreign service officer was, generally, of
                    course, a man, and they weren't interested in a wife at all. Literally, at one
                    point, a hostess at my own home in Belgrade, somebody said to me, “It's not you
                    I want to talk to. It's your husband.” [laughter]</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: So, at the time, I wanted to prove I had a brain, but now, anyway, my
                    brain's getting worse and worse. [laughter] Now it doesn't matter any more!
                    [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's not a question of your brain. It's a question of the
                        time in your life. Is it worthwhile going back to do that sort of thing now,
                        don't you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Yes, yes. Partly, through Evermay, I can pursue topics that interest me,
                    and they broaden enormously beyond historical demography, which I actually still
                    think is fascinating. But it's too late now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you have done with that as a career?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: At the time that I was really actively pursuing the Ph.D., I think I
                    consoled myself when it became clear that it was Romania or the Ph.D., that
                    options were limited. Oh, and the other thing was that it would have meant was
                    my staying at least another six months here, with the rest of the family
                    scattered, basically. It would have been very difficult for our son, who was
                    about eight years old, and so on and so forth. Ed would have gone to Romania on
                    his own, and how would I have managed son Edward, and all these things. But,
                    realistically, the only thing I could have done with a Ph.D. in historical
                    demography, probably, was to teach at university level as a lecturer. And I
                    would have enjoyed that, but if Ed was going to Romania, he would probably have
                    another assignment after that, and that would mean eight years away, because
                    they were normally four-year assignments.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: So the whole thing just wasn't going to work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that the days before separate maintenance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: This was '82. I can't remember if they already had separate
                    maintenance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: I think they did, as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But still. The disruption, the family disruption.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: I wasn't that interested in going to Romania, which actually turned out
                    to be our most interesting post, but I guess I just didn't like the idea of
                    sending him off on his own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no. And you had other priorities at the time, too, so
                        Romania didn't seem to be very high, understandably very high. [laughter]
                        But to get that close to a Ph.D. It must have been a little upsetting at the
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: It was upsetting, but I was. . . . Of course, finances are always a
                    bigger problem in Washington than overseas, and my mother had died. It had been
                    a four-year assignment here, and my mother had died of an accident about
                    eighteen months into the assignment. And, of course, that was in London, and I
                    had to deal with her house, and so on and so forth. And I was just at that point
                    doing the qualifying courses to even allow me to start on the program. I was
                    teaching for Montgomery County, which meant doing other courses [text obscured
                    by laughter], and we had three young children. And the exhaustion of the
                    “up-until-two-o'clock-in-the-morning”, and getting up again at eight. So, in a
                    way, all this was going to get much easier, but it was important for me to be
                    teaching, even though it was just substitution at-home instruction, in order to
                    have a little extra money to spend on this and that. So I remember being upset
                    in one way, but just not prepared to deal with the whole business of staying
                    here on my own and trying to keep everything going. I just remember reaching a
                    decision after a couple of weeks, and thinking it would really be better if I
                    went to Romania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a decision that so many people made. And now, the
                        women oftentimes are making it the other way and staying here, out of
                        economic necessity. We just had a talk about that yesterday here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Because I didn't have . . . . The Ph. D was serious work, but I planned
                    to return to teaching. Oh, this was the other thing. I knew I could probably get
                    a job in Bucharest. And although the salary in Bucharest was going to be much,
                    much lower, it was a long time since I'd taught full-time, so that was another
                    factor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you did go right to work in Bucharest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Yes, I began teaching at the American School of Bucharest. I think
                    overseas employment is a huge problem, but also I imagine it happens less now.
                    But at first, people were so critical of wives who either worked full-time, or
                    wanted to work full-time. Particularly, when you're confronted with children's
                    college, it is an economic necessity, if you want your children to have the same
                    level of education, and probably the professional life that you've enjoyed. It's
                    not a matter of choice. So I felt irritated when people would criticize.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I know, that's true. I think part of that was that
                        the people who weren't working were still in the pre-1972 mode. A lot really
                        didn't change, when you come right down to it. And I think the people who
                        weren't working resented the fact that they were baking the cookies while
                        you were off teaching, or something. I really do feel that was a part of
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: There were so many resentments, in a way, created by 1972, even though,
                    in general, I think it was for the good. The resentments were most apparent in
                    Bucharest.</p>

                <p>McBRIDE: Oh no [laughter] From Bucharest, Ed had no assignment. He was also
                    pretty sick. Well, not sick, but he'd broken a disc in his back.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: We went straight from Paris to Dakar. And, as so often happens — it's
                    not quite pay, pack, and follow — but Ed had to be there yesterday. I'd just had
                    a baby, so Ed went on ahead, and I packed up from Paris and came about a month
                    later. I arrived with a newborn baby and a one-year-old, and I arrived from a
                    pretty glamorous life, in a way, in Paris. Ed met me at the airport, and we went
                    straight to the house in Dakar. And the entire cultural section, which, happily,
                    wasn't large, or USIS, or something, not the PAO, came too because they were so
                    bored in Dakar they had nothing better to do than go to the airport. [laughter]
                    But then they stayed for drinks. And I had to breast-feed one child and keep the
                    other in its highchair [laughter], so by the time they left, probably round
                    about eight in the evening, I was exhausted. I'd just packed out from the
                    apartment in Paris. By the time they left I was ready to kill all of them, so it
                    wasn't a very auspicious beginning. [laughter] However, his colleagues turned
                    out to be very nice. Obviously, I got to know them better. But Dakar was hard
                    after Paris. And Dakar, by African standards, is basically an easy post. But it
                    was the beginning of the Sahel drought, and so, a lot of the time we were
                    without water. Not for the first year, actually, but it was getting tough in the
                    second year, and for the third year, it was extremely difficult. And so, if
                    water's a huge problem, it's not only drinking water, but washing, and anything
                    became very difficult. You had to plan everything. It was meant to be a two-year
                    posting. But because Ed was supposed to be there sooner rather than later, he
                    had to defer his home leave until the following Christmas, four months after we
                    arrived. When we got back, we were told that the posting only started from the
                    time we returned from home leave. When we arrived, it was a hardship
                    differential post. Within our first six months there, three members of the
                    American embassy staff, died of things they would not have died of had they been
                    anywhere other than Dakar. But that was kind of depressing, because . . . .
                    Obviously, depressing, helping people pack up; but you were very well aware that
                    if you got seriously ill, you were in trouble. Nevertheless, I was sort of
                    adjusting to Dakar. But then, the State Department, in its wisdom, announced, no
                    hardship differential. Health was the biggest issue. I just was outraged. So
                    this was one of the few activism things I did. I read in some newsletter that
                    this new office had been created called the ombudsman, and you could write to
                    him with all your complaints. And I decided it wasn't much good me, on my own,
                    writing, but I would get every single embassy spouse to write and say that Dakar
                    should have at least some sort of hardship differential. While I realized that
                    in times of budget cutting, which I think was part of the reason, Dakar wasn't
                    as difficult as many other posts, nevertheless, health facilities were dreadful;
                    three people had died; no recreational facilities, etc., etc. So, eventually, I
                    got everybody from the ambassador's wife on down to write this pretty
                    comprehensive report of why Dakar should have a hardship differential. It caused
                    enough of a stir that they sent the under secretary for Africa, or something, to
                    speak to us all; and he said, well, while Dakar would no longer get the ten
                    percent differential, they were going to institute a sliding scale and we would
                    get somewhere between five and ten percent. By the time his visit happened and
                    we were told that—the reports etc. had obviously taken a long time — we, the
                    McBrides, were due to leave in about six months time. However Dakar never did
                    get its hardship differential. What it did get, which made a huge difference to
                    people's retirement, was that every year you spent in Dakar counted eighteen
                    months towards retirement rather than just a year. And actually, for some years
                    after that — if you were on home leave or in the State Department for any reason
                    — people would come up and thank me. So that was my only serious piece of
                    activism, in Dakar. It was interesting. Because of two very small children, we
                    didn't travel all that much, but we did go down to The Gambia, which, at the
                    time — now, the beach is lined with hotels and clubs and everything — but at the
                    time there was nothing. There was this pristine sandy beach that extended for
                    miles, with one little hotel on it that was called when we went there — because
                    nobody had decided what to name it — it was called the New Hotel. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It probably still is today. [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: We went there right before we left. We must also have gone very soon
                    after our arrival, because Ed was in some way responsible for The Gambia. We
                    went again right before our departure, because I wanted to return; and I was
                    staggered, because in that time, so many hotels and things had been built. We
                    made lots of very good friends in Dakar. People were responsible for creating
                    their own fun. Unexpected things happened. There were really only two grocery
                    stores to shop in, and all Westerners had an account there. You never paid
                    money. People had very little money around because of the risk of theft. The
                    exception was that, on the last day of the month, everybody would cash a check,
                    or whatever you did to get money from the embassy, and then we all would go to
                    this place called the Ranch Filfili and pay the bill. Which meant, of course,
                    that people had much more money than usual in the house on whatever it was, the
                    last Saturday, or the last day of the month. Our house had tiled floors
                    everywhere, and I was often up in the middle of the night, either for one of the
                    children, or just because I needed the lavatory. So one night I was up more than
                    usual — twice — and not for the children. Just because something woke me up and
                    then I went to the loo. And I realized afterwards that, in fact, one of those
                    times, there must have been a thief in the room with me. But fortunately, I
                    didn't realize this. The next morning, when we went downstairs to breakfast . .
                    . . We had a Senegalese servant, euphemistically called a houseboy, but it's
                    quite a strictly Muslim country, and he would not come upstairs; and we had a
                    female who was responsible for the upstairs and who helped with the children.
                    The houseboy hadn't got breakfast, or anything. He was sitting glumly in the
                    middle of the kitchen, staring at my jewelry, which was scattered all over the
                    floor. It turned out, of course, that the thief had come up, and taken the
                    money, which was on the bedside table, on Ed's side of the bed. He, the thief,
                    had opened drawers enough to find my jewelry, take it downstairs, and go through
                    it; but what he was looking for was Senegalese jewelry, because then the gold
                    could be melted down; and mine was basically European pieces, so that happily he
                    didn't want them. He didn't want my engagement ring either. So that was okay.
                    But that was not really traumatic.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Oh, we had a guard, but the guard had fallen asleep.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter] I've had that happen, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Another thing that happened. I was actually very fond of this houseboy,
                    but one day . . . . I'm not really an early riser, and I would amaze myself. To
                    go to the market, you'd get up and leave at about six-thirty, so I'd be back in
                    the house, with all the shopping and everything done, by about eight. One day, I
                    came back — must have been a bit later than eight because Ed had gone to work.
                    Anyway, I came back and I found the driveway, which was a short driveway — it
                    must have been about twenty yards from the street — full of people. The
                    watchman, who was there during the day, too, was nowhere to be seen. The gates
                    were open, so I drove the car right in. The house was a split level, and had a
                    sort of half basement, and so from the garage I went in there. And I found the
                    little laundry room was full of people, too. But I could hear a sort of fracas
                    in the room behind. I went in there, a big, basically empty room; and I arrived
                    just at the moment that the houseboy had smashed an empty bottle, and he and
                    another man were about to go for one another with these bottles. And there were
                    lots of women on the sidelines, mainly Senegalese women. In one of those impulse
                    things, I sort of raced in between them and yelled, stop! I had a certain
                    authority just because I was the wife of the occupant of the house; and
                    amazingly, they did stop. And it turned out that he, the houseboy, was involved
                    with another woman, not his wife. I don't think the other man was married to
                    this woman. Anyway, it was almost a tribal thing. All these people were the
                    supporters from two different groups. But it was sad, because we then had to
                    fire him, because I thought, “we can't let this possibly happen when I'm leaving
                    my two small daughters in the house, and everything falls apart when two people
                    start fighting.” So then, we got someone else, and he was also very, very good,
                    but he decided to go and see his family in Guinea, so he walked there through
                    the jungle. I didn't expect to see him ever again, and he said he'd be back in
                    six months. But actually, he returned in about eighteen months, so I was
                    thrilled to see him. It was hard to make Senegalese friends, but I did have one
                    friend. Her name was Madame Diop, and she was a wonderful woman. She was the
                    wife of the director of the theater. But the sad part about all of this was that
                    most of these people, including Madame Diop, were illiterate, so you could never
                    keep up with them once you'd left Senegal. But Senegal was hard for me. After
                    the first three people died, the State Department decided we needed a medical
                    officer. They had at first been very difficult about medevac ing people, for
                    budget reasons apparently, but they subsequently were willing to medevac people
                    much more quickly than at first. So we got a wonderful nurse, who was there
                    full-time, and then there was a doctor who was there a lot of the time, although
                    he traveled a lot. So the health thing changed a great deal. But before that,
                    Sarah and Charlotte, our daughters, who were very small, were ill a lot with
                    unidentifiable fevers and this and that. So health was an endless worry, because
                    you never knew, really, what was wrong with them. And Sarah went into
                    convulsions one time. My advantage was I spoke good French. I'd had two babies
                    in Paris, so at least I could race off to the French pediatrician, who was very
                    nice, before we got an embassy doctor and nurse. And then Ed got meningitis, and
                    it took ages before that was diagnosed, and he was very, very ill; and then he
                    had to be in a darkened room for about a month. So the real problems with Dakar
                    were health, basically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that's so important. That's the most important
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Yes, because if you're endlessly worried about someone's illness(?), you
                    can't participate in anything. And although we, to a great extent, made our own
                    entertainment — of course, once again, no videos, nothing like that in the early
                    '70s — but there was a strong embassy community, and a strong international
                    community. We made some wonderful friends, who are still friends. We would give
                    crazy kind of parties, which involved not quite treasure hunts, but all sorts of
                    . . . .</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Scavenger hunts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Scavenger hunts. Thank you. And the beach was a plus, because you could
                    go to the beach. Very little cultural activity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds very much like Freetown. Freetown was much the
                        same way. You heavily depended on your friends. We did have Sierra Leonean
                        friends because the women had been educated, in London, some of them. They'd
                        gone up with their husbands, gone up to Sandhurst, where the military . . .
                        . And they were not tribal people. They were descendants of the freed
                        slaves. That was what Freetown was all about, of course. There was a huge
                        cultural divide there, but there were educated women, and we spoke English,
                        and they loved their gardens. It could have been worse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: I had no real chance to compare Francophone and Anglophone except for
                    going down to what was then so-called The Gambia, but it seemed to me that the
                    French had a far more paternalistic approach, and treated the Senegalese much
                    more as children. And they would give detailed instructions about everything. I
                    think the British, despite all the horrendous things about colonialism, were
                    really trying more to educate and bring their colonies to an independent
                    position. The French, I noticed, were far more exact in their instructions to
                    household help, and so on, than certainly the British were used to being. We had
                    a succession of people who helped with the children. The person who I inherited
                    from my predecessor was a woman called Seynabou, who was quite old by Senegalese
                    standards, and had children who were grown; the expectation of life for a
                    Senegalese person at that time was somewhere in your thirties. But again,
                    probably in connection with the bottle breaking incident and fight . . . . I
                    realized that since Seynabou was completely illiterate, she couldn't dial a
                    telephone if anything went wrong at home. So, although I left a telephone number
                    whenever Ed and I went out in the evening, it was absolutely useless. So I
                    insisted on having somebody who was at least literate enough to be able to dial
                    a phone. And I feel guilty about Seynabou because I don't know that she would
                    ever have gotten another job. Anyway, her replacement was jet black, a splendid
                    person called Blanche. You had to tell Blanche exactly what to do. One day I'd
                    said, please put the bathing suits on the children, who were by this time about
                    two and three. And I could hear a tremendous rumpus going on upstairs, and I
                    went to see what was happening. And I found that my problem was that I had not
                    said to Blanche, take their clothes off first. [laughter] Sarah was old enough
                    to realize that this was all horribly wrong. [laughter] And I think, in fact, if
                    I'd been a French woman, I would have done it correctly, if you see what I mean
                    (by telling her to take their clothes off first) It wasn't Blanche's fault. It
                    was just that she was obviously more used to French instructions. Our two-year
                    posting to Dakar kept being extended, because after the announcement that our
                    deferred home leave meant that the assignment ran from January, then the
                    American government announced it hadn't enough money to move any foreign service
                    officers until the end of the budget year, which, at this point, was July. What
                    with one thing and another, the meningitis episode was probably fairly recent at
                    this point, I couldn't get out of Dakar fast enough (after three years) So we
                    got to the airport, I think, on July the first, and at our farewell party, we
                    had met, or I had met, the deputy director of Air Afrique. We must have been
                    flying Air Afrique. Strangely, I can't remember why. At any rate, he said, oh,
                    if you have any problem, just phone me; and he gave me his card. And July the
                    first happened to be a Sunday, and off we go to the airport. We've packed out
                    the house and everything's fine. We get to the airport, where there's a riot
                    scene. And Ed goes and checks in, or tries to, and to be told that our tickets
                    weren't in order. We knew this couldn't be right. One of the friends was the
                    local director of Lufthansa, who went off and said, “I'll sort it out for you.”
                    After about half an hour, he came back, and said, “I can't do anything for you.”
                    I think the plane was supposed to leave at ten, and we got there at eight, or
                    something; and there were lots of friends there to see us off. But there was
                    this chaotic scene of hundreds of people at the airport. And then we realized
                    that part of this was that it was the first day of the “grandes vacances” for
                    the French community. And of course no-one answered at the number that the Air
                    Afrique chap had given me. Well, finally somebody, our Lufthansa friend I think,
                    came and announced that our tickets were okay, but the problem was that we
                    weren't handing over a bribe to get on the plane. [laughter] And Ed said, I'm
                    not handing over a bribe!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that sounds so like my husband, too. [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: We had this terrible time. And meanwhile, the plane was meant to have
                    left, but it clearly hadn't left. So, I suppose Ed kicked up enough of a fuss
                    that they finally said they'd let us on the plane. We had the pushchair for
                    Charlotte, and I was carrying Sarah, and we thought we were about to miss the
                    plane. There was quite an expanse of tarmac between the building and the plane,
                    and Ed was carrying stuff, I don't know, the impedimenta you have with small
                    children; and I remember running after him. He was first, and I was running
                    after him, and poor Sarah was running behind. And, to this day — she's now in
                    her thirties — she remembers that, and her terror because she thought she was
                    going to be left behind. Anyway, so we got on the plane and found that the plane
                    had lots of seats left, and didn't leave for ages, presumably because they were
                    waiting for everybody's bribe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a typical West African story. [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Then we were back here for ten months, for Ed to learn Serbo-Croatian.
                    We moved into our house in Woodacres and had a very happy ten months. I was
                    determined. . . . My only thing that I was determined about in the foreign
                    service is that I wouldn't go anywhere without learning the language. Ed went to
                    language school, I think at FSI, but I wasn't allowed to.</p>

                <p>McBRIDE: Yes. In the end, for about three months before going to Belgrade, I had
                    tutoring. I'd been doing the tapes at home, and then had tutoring from a
                    marvelous man, Mr. Popovich. I would go to his house. He was a formidable
                    character, to the point that some people were scared of him, but he and I got
                    along fine. He had fought on the royalist side in Yugoslavia during World War
                    II, so I believe that's why he and the family were in the United States, where
                    they'd been for a long time, and his English was very good. So I learned a lot
                    about his experiences during the war, and so on. One thing happened in
                    connection with being a foreign service wife. [laughter] It sounds as though I
                    was pregnant all the time, which isn't true. But anyway, I had another baby
                    right before we left, and Ed's PAO in Belgrade was a man called Terry Catherman,
                    a very, very strong and somewhat formidable character. I'd never met Terry
                    Catherman, and I had just given birth, never my best moment. And the phone
                    rings, and Ed was on his way back from language training, and the caller
                    explained that he was Terry Catherman, and I made all the right noises and said,
                    could I give Ed a message? And he replied, “no, I'll just call back. It's
                    nothing important. I want him to come to Belgrade before the fourth of July.”
                    [laughter] And I, completely taken aback, said, “Nothing important! I want you
                    to know that at that stage my baby will be three weeks old. [laughter] I am just
                    out of hospital. I've got to empty the house.” I read him this whole long
                    lecture of how I couldn't move then. [laughter] I would never have done this had
                    I actually met Terry Catherman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was just a voice on the other end. [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: So I told him all the reasons my husband couldn't be there by July the
                    fourth, and Ed wasn't there by July the fourth, [laughter] I think because I'd
                    been so insistent. Anyway, Terry Catherman turned out to be very nice, but if
                    I'd met him, I don't think I'd have said all that. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went from Belgrade to Bucharest to Romania to
                        Budapest. How did he get into the eastern European . . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: He'd expressed interest in the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, he had. Oh, okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: So Belgrade: Tito was still alive, so it was still Yugoslavia. And it
                    was still extraordinary difficult for wives to work, although I think that they
                    could work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you had the '72 directive while you were in
                        Belgrade. No, no, it's in Senegal; but it probably didn't make much
                        difference in Senegal.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: It didn't make much difference at all at this point, but it also
                    wouldn't have made much difference anyway, because unless you had — I had pretty
                    good Serbo-Croatian in the end — but unless you had really fluent
                    Serbo-Croatian, nobody would have been interested in you. Plus the fact, that
                    the Yugoslavs wouldn't allow foreigners, in general, to work for Yugoslav
                    organizations. So really, your only option was the American School of Belgrade.
                    It was the International School of Belgrade. And anyway, I had these small
                    children. In the end, I finished up working at a British nursery school not far
                    from us, not because this is my forte at all, but because, Edward, our youngest
                    child, by the time he was two, would be desperately upset when his sisters were
                    going off to the international school every morning. Somebody at the British
                    nursery school knew I was a former teacher. I was actually a high school
                    teacher. But anyway, they said any teacher was better than no teacher, so I was
                    the sole teacher at the British nursery school for a year, but I insisted that
                    Edward be able to come. So that was the only actual job I had. I seemed to be
                    quite busy. I was quite involved in the American women's group. We traveled a
                    lot, but the intellectual thing that was most important to me was that I got
                    very interested in Orthodox monasteries and late Medieval, early Renaissance
                    history. The monasteries throughout Yugoslavia, in art-history terms, were, and
                    are, extraordinary. So whenever Ed took leave, we tended to try to go to some of
                    the out-of-the-way places in Yugoslavia. That was wonderful, because
                    Serbo-Croatians, everywhere that now makes up the several countries, were all
                    fond of children and they were all helpful. The monasteries, in particular, were
                    generally out in the country, so the children could run around and not be
                    desperately bored with art history. And the sad, sad part is that some of them
                    were destroyed in the recent war — I could go through a whole long list of the
                    ones we visited. But at least in Skopje, well, the town of Ohrid, which is not
                    all that far from Skopje, the monasteries weren't destroyed, and that's the most
                    extraordinary place. The monasteries were out in the country because of the
                    invading Turks. But that meant, of course, that history largely bypassed them,
                    and that's why so many of the paintings survived. This worked out all right
                    until the most recent Balkan war; some of the monasteries that we saw were
                    completely destroyed, with these amazing Renaissance-style paintings that were
                    painted a hundred years before the Renaissance. It just seems dreadful. So,
                    anyway, that was a great pleasure in Yugoslavia, and I also got involved with
                    several Serbs or art historians, who later became Dumbarton Oaks fellows. So
                    then when we came back here, we knew some fellows, and so I used to go there
                    periodically for lunch—also a pleasure. In terms of what wives did and didn't
                    do, directive or not directive, Ed was told that he should give a cocktail party
                    once a month for incoming Fulbright Scholars, students, and other people
                    associated with the university. Actually, we didn't have to do it once a month;
                    we alternated this with the deputy cultural attach�. That was a complete
                    nightmare! [laughter] You couldn't get food easily in Yugoslavia. It wasn't that
                    there was no food, but there wasn't the kind of food that you'd expect to have
                    at cocktail parties. We also had no help. Nobody wanted to work for us because
                    we had three children under five. Eventually, we got somebody called Kruna, who
                    was very easily upset; when she was upset, she would sit down and cry and talk
                    to herself. She had some kind of mental handicap. Anyway, she wasn't a cook, but
                    she did love the children. [laughter] You could get some sort of British
                    biscuits (cookies), and depending on the meat situation, you could go off to get
                    lamb. Every time you bought a leg of lamb, you had to buy the head, as well.
                    That was the way it worked: If you bought a good cut, you had to buy something
                    that wasn't profitable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That wouldn't sell on its own.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Yes. And I never actually . . . . I would give it back to the butcher,
                    because I don't know what to with a head of lamb, so I would always give it
                    back. Anyway, it was made very clear to me that I didn't have to do anything
                    about these parties. But the question then became, if Ed was going to give a
                    party but was at the office all day, who would prepare for the party?
                    [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right! Exactly!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: So I did a lot of cooking in Yugoslavia. And I actually found Yugoslavia
                    fine, but there was some fear that either the car or the house was bugged; and
                    we certainly were subject to some kind of control, but very, very little. We
                    were given some kind of briefing before we left, and told all the things you
                    mustn't do. And one of the things you mustn't do was to have a fight between
                    husband and wife, because this could be used against you as blackmail. So, Ed
                    and I were settling down to a big argument, a big row about something.
                    [laughter] Suddenly, in the middle of it, I said, “Suppose we're being bugged!”
                    [laughter] And Ed replied, “I don't give a damn! [laughter] So what? What are
                    they going to do? They can't blackmail me with this row—people do sometimes
                    argue!” [laughter] And this, actually, was extraordinarily helpful, because from
                    that day onwards, if we had a row, I never really worried about the fact that it
                    could be used as blackmail against us. In a later post, Bucharest, where we were
                    quite definitely bugged all the time, it was helpful to know that at least if
                    you're having a fight, you can say what you think and it doesn't really matter.
                    . . . . It sounds as if we were fighting all the time. But you couldn't discuss
                    the least bit of embassy gossip; I whispered for about six months after leaving
                    Bucharest. [laughter] So, otherwise, Yugoslavia was fine. Once again, we made a
                    lot of friends, and had a lot of fun with parties. I look back on the beauty of
                    the country, and the countryside, and think with sadness about some of the
                    people we knew really quite well who just . . . . I don't know what happened to
                    them. Ed had to go to the Dubrovnik Festival each year, and I sometimes went. At
                    one point, I was pretty sick, and so somebody whom my mother had found in
                    England came out and took care of the children. And I sort of convalesced in
                    Dubrovnik, while he was there for the festival. It was such a magical place,
                    where we knew people, and I wonder what happened to them, because their
                    livelihoods, once again, if not their lives, were destroyed by the war. Then,
                    from Yugoslavia, we a stateside assignment for four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is a nice break, in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: It was a wonderful break. I was thrilled to come back to the house. I
                    was thrilled to be in America. I'm not good at moving, actually. It takes me
                    ages to adjust and make friends and get used to it and stop complaining, and so
                    on and so forth. And I imagine I did a share of that when I came back to the
                    States, but it was different. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you knew it was going to be all right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Ed absolutely loved the job he had at that time, which was doing
                    something in the exhibits division of USIA, but it basically involved
                    coordinating and organizing art exhibitions. So he went, for instance, to
                    meetings of the American Association of Museum Directors, and he's always been
                    interested in, and, I think, pretty knowledgeable, about, in particular,
                    twentieth-century art. But obviously, for him, professionally, it was enormously
                    interesting; and intellectually, too, I think it was rewarding. He would
                    periodically go off to AAMD meetings, but otherwise, we got on with doing all
                    the ordinary things that American families do. It was at that time that I began
                    qualifying to do a Ph.D. in historical demography, and I was also teaching and
                    doing various other things that I already mentioned. Ed knew that he wanted to
                    go back to Eastern Europe. So the Romanian assignment took a while to come up. I
                    knew that the school situation for Sarah and Charlotte wasn't going to be that
                    good. I'd seen it with all the children, even in Belgrade, where the school was
                    very good, but it often became more difficult if they were going to be in middle
                    and high school. So I thought that if we were going to be in Eastern Europe, it
                    would be better if the older children were in a British boarding school. That
                    made, obviously, a huge difference to all our lives, and actually a longtime
                    difference to the lives of Sarah and Charlotte. The big drama about Romania was
                    what we would do in education terms. I had put them down some time before for a
                    couple of British boarding schools, and we looked only at schools that were
                    within easy distance of Heathrow. So when we went to Bucharest, Sarah and
                    Charlotte went to boarding school in England. And educationally, that worked out
                    well. The American School of Bucharest was a very good school, but the problem
                    there was that Edward, who was, I think — I may not have this right — but he was
                    basically two years ahead of his grade, and the school decided because he was
                    bored in what should have been his grade, which I think was second grade. . . .
                    In the end, they put him in fourth or fifth grade. The trouble with fourth or
                    fifth grade was that although he enjoyed the classes all right, there was only
                    one other little boy, who was a very nice little boy, but he was Israeli and he
                    spoke no English. Otherwise, there were nine girls in the class. Ed and I did a
                    lot of entertaining in the house, really because there wasn't anywhere else to
                    entertain. I mean, there was no other entertainment. Diplomats relied on one
                    another. Edward was becoming increasingly precocious and reliant on us focompany
                    and social interchange. I remember Edward, aged about seven, lecturing the
                    French military attach� at some point on some obscure detail of the Napoleonic
                    Wars [laughter} So, we decided in the end and with great heartache, to send
                    Edward off to boarding school in England at nine years old. I had been sent off
                    as a child at ten years old, but my little boy, at nine years old, going from
                    one foreign country to another..... . . . . Anyway, we decided it was the best
                    thing, and perhaps it was the best thing. What we hadn't realized was that if,
                    as a small boy, you go into the British school system, then — a prep school, as
                    they call it there, boys from about nine to thirteen — their one goal is for
                    that child to win a scholarship to a well-known school for older boys, and they
                    thought Edward was material for this. But we hadn't quite realized we were
                    starting him down a British track. The thing that finally convinced us to send
                    him to England was that the State Department sent, for all American children —
                    and I think it was very good that they did this — they sent a sort of
                    psychological and educational testing person. Can't remember her exact title.
                    Anyway, this very pleasant woman, highly professional in her manner and
                    qualifications, said that Edward really was not in the right place for his
                    scholastic achievement; and that socially it was not going to be good if he
                    stayed in the Bucharest school. She recommended that he be sent to another
                    school. Despite this, since he was only nine years old, the State Department
                    would never give us an allowance for him. But today, I imagine, times have
                    changed, and they probably would. Anyway, I was very cross about that at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were always out of pocket for schools if we didn't send
                        our children to the one that was available there, which was most of the
                        time. McBRIDE: It's amazing. I thought it was particularly amazing that
                        after this counselor said . . . . And, oh, we had the choice — we actually
                        discussed — she said, either you should change posts — you know, there are

                <p>McBRIDE: Anyway, Ed would have had to start the bidding process all over again,
                    and he already had, not a year, but six or eight months, or whatever it was,
                    invested in learning Romanian; and, by this time, about another eight or nine
                    months speaking Romanian. So anyway, we didn't cut short Romania.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Edward stayed in his school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: No, we sent him to boarding school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but he stayed in the boarding school in England. He
                        didn't move to another?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: The problem was, you see, that the English school thought he was
                    scholarship material. We knew he was going to do the scholarship program, but it
                    never occurred to us that he would actually win a scholarship to Eton. How do
                    you say no to a scholarship to Eton?</p>

                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: But he later came to college here. However, I think there are two huge
                    problems to this very day for the foreign service. One is the question of wives'
                    employment, because whatever is said, and it does get a little better every
                    year, many wives simply cannot transfer their careers from one country to
                    another, so that wives in my generation, if they could get jobs at all, were
                    content with having any job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Underemployment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: That's what you would do, from post to post. You would get whatever work
                    you could. But the other huge problem is education, because many of the schools
                    in more out-of-the-way posts are excellent little schools — not all of them
                    little, of course. In fact, often the smaller ones may be the best ones. But
                    they're not going to be the ideal school for everybody, and if you have a child
                    that needs a special program of one kind or another, the schools simply cannot
                    provide them. I don't really know the way to solve either of these problems, but
                    I certainly think more could and should be done. I mean, there must be more
                    people who are traveling special education people, and so on, who could go from
                    post to post. There must be more possibility of allowances, because . . .</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, I really don't know what it's like now. What
                        it's like now is that a lot of wives aren't going along, because we have 700
                        unaccompanied positions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: This was the other thing I mentioned earlier. In Bucharest, really, I
                    became aware for the first time — and once again, this may be quite different
                    now — of the tremendous hostility that existed between foreign service female
                    officers and the generally female spouses who were lucky enough to get
                    employment at the embassy. Then the hostility between couples, where one person
                    was a foreign service officer and the other was not, or hostility in terms of
                    assignments — tandem couples were often thought to get preferential treatment .
                    . . . There were so many people who often thought that the other person had a
                    better deal than they had. And in Romania, this probably mattered a lot. Another
                    thing that was most unfortunate, in my view, was that there were Romanians who
                    really had nothing. A lot of them were starving, actually starving, in winter;
                    and Americans, of course, had plenty of food. Sometimes people would be . . . .
                    We had our food: (a) we were allowed to use the Romanian diplomatic shops, which
                    actually had very little in them, but you could get meat and you could get milk
                    and you could get yogurt, and a few canned supplies that were normally Romanian
                    supplies for export. (b) we also had support flights. The plane would come once
                    every two months, and it would bring masses of fresh vegetables and meat, as
                    well as American canned goods, and two months ahead of time, you would order
                    what you wanted. We were given two freezers and two fridges, large freezers and
                    fridges, so on the day the support flight would come — it was always a Saturday,
                    I think . . . . Maybe not, because people would take time off from the embassy.
                    Anyway, a certain number of people — we all took it in turns to rotate — would
                    go out to the airport. The flight came in the afternoon, and you'd watch huge
                    pallets of supplies being unloaded from the plane. We all sorted everything out
                    by people's order forms, there on the airport runway. But then somebody decided,
                    wisely, I think, that we should do it at the embassy. So it changed later. You
                    would spend the next few days freezing all the vegetables and the meats and the
                    milk and everything. So that was really astonishing. But, of course, once you
                    had all these supplies in your house, sometimes things would disappear. I
                    couldn't really blame Romanian staff. I'm sure our own housekeeper never took
                    anything, but diplomats gave quite lavish parties there, and for the party, you
                    would bring in waiters and helpers, who were all paid with Kent cigarettes, and
                    may have been light-fingered. Kent cigarettes were the unofficial currency, and,
                    of course, Ken cigarettes would come in on the support flight, too. But if I had
                    been Romanian with almost no easy access to food, I probably would have stolen
                    this and that from my house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: But some American employees would get apoplectic with rage about this.
                    And sometimes, if a person heard of an American who'd actually given somebody a
                    piece of meat or a bag of sugar, they were absolutely horrified and said that
                    the American government had paid to fly in this food (for Americans only)
                    Absolutely true, but if you gave someone some food, you probably gave a tiny
                    little bit towards improving their attitude towards the United States. So
                    anyway, food was a major concern.</p>

                <p>McBRIDE: Oh, Ceausescu.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Yes, but we were followed. I mean, I don't know when we were followed.
                    The car was bugged, like everything else. In one incident while we were there,
                    somebody took their shoes to be repaired. We were all were taking our shoes to
                    different local Romanian shops to be repaired. And then they discovered that a
                    bug had been put in the heel of one of the shoes. [laughter] So then we weren't
                    allowed to use local repairmen. And somebody would come and sweep the house for
                    bugs occasionally. As far as I remember, they eventually decided not to bother
                    since there were so many controls from the Romanian Securitate. But since this
                    great moment of awakening in Yugoslavia [laughter], I didn't really care about
                    being bugged.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: After the first year, yes. Yes, but I was teaching at the American
                    school, and that was an enormously rewarding experience. There were actually
                    more non-Americans there than Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All the expatriate children.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: And it was such fun. My class — because that was where they had a
                    vacancy—my main class was the fifth grade. I taught the fifth grade everything,
                    including chemistry and math. [laughter] Math at that level was probably okay.
                    The chemistry was always a bit iffy, but I learned a lot. [laughter] . . . Oh,
                    English was great fun. I also learned a lot. But the best was social studies at
                    the fifth grade level . . . . I was given a syllabus, but you were meant to
                    teach them the entire history of the world in a year including something about
                    the Middle East and the rise of Christianity and Islam and Judaism and so on.
                    And, of course, I had little Christian, Hebrew, and Moslem children in the
                    class. They could all talk about their home countries, and in some cases, at
                    least say something about their home religion. So it was a wonderful experience,
                    but it did keep me very busy. And then, we had quite a lot of entertaining
                    responsibilities, and also I was involved in a few different groups,
                    particularly the Anglican church, which was the only English-speaking church, to
                    which a lot of Romanians came. The Romanians came, partly, I think, for
                    religious reasons, but some undoubtedly because they wanted help getting visas
                    to leave the country, and also because coffee and biscuits were served after
                    church. Our house was very near the church, and held a lot of people. We gave a
                    big Christmas party each year, to which all the church congregation came. There
                    was always a van, presumably Securitate, outside the church, so they presumably
                    knew all the Romanians who went to the church, and therefore to our party.
                    Nevertheless, we could give an awful lot of people food and some feeling of
                    Christmas celebration. So we did a lot of entertaining. Once again, we traveled
                    all through the county. Wonderful art-history and other opportunities. I got
                    involved with some elderly nuns, who lived out in the country, about three
                    hours' drive, at least, from Bucharest. But we occasionally went there, and
                    would take them food. They lived in medieval conditions in huge, old stone
                    buildings and the nuns were wrapped in layers of sort of rough wool clothing.
                    It's hard to tell if it was true, but I gather that Ceausescu's Romania had no
                    use for the elderly and the retired, or people like nuns, who weren't
                    contributing to the economy. So they had virtually no money and could buy almost
                    nothing. We asked them what they needed and they said, soap. So, we would take
                    them food and soap about two or three times a year. One time we took them
                    oranges, from the support flight, in fact. But it didn't have the desired effect
                    at all, because when we handed them over, one of the nuns burst into tears and
                    said she hadn't seen an orange since before the war. So stuff like that seemed
                    to keep one quite busy. By the time we left, we actually had the trust of quite
                    a few people, so I was touched by their affection when we left. You never knew
                    who was and wasn't spying on you, because if a lot of Romanians had permission
                    to come to your house to see a movie or for a meal or whatever, then amongst
                    those Romanians there would have had to have been some who were reporting to the
                    government. So you never really knew to whom you could say anything. But
                    occasionally, if a Romanian knew I was going out of the country, he or she would
                    say to me, for example “If it's okay, I want to slip you a letter. I will be at
                    the market at eleven o'clock on Tuesday, and we'll just meet by chance, and I'll
                    slip the letter into your shopping bag.” So there were extraordinary episodes
                    like that. I've mentioned what a pleasure it was teaching at the school, but I
                    only actually taught at the school for two years, because then, with Edward in
                    boarding school in England, I knew he would need a lot of support. So I felt I
                    couldn't commit to full-time teaching for another year. So I just occasionally
                    substituted at the school for the last year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then, did you go to England to see him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: So I would go to England to see him. It was during that last year that
                    there was a big freeze in Bucharest. As I've implied, we had a large house, but
                    the heating of the house was by gas, and Romania had its coldest winter in a
                    very long time, fifty or a hundred years. Everything froze, and the snow was
                    piled high in the streets. Ceausescu was so determined to maintain a positive
                    balance of payments that he ordered that the gas heat be turned off most of the
                    time. So nobody, ourselves included, had heat in the house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have fireplaces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: We had one wood-burning fireplace, but the older rooms in this house had
                    high, high ceilings, and it was large. Romanians were anyway only allowed to
                    have one light bulb burning at any given time, so there was no heat and very
                    little light. We were unlimited for electricity, so we could have on as many
                    lights as we wanted. When the gas suddenly went off without warning, we, of
                    course, were giving a dinner party that night [laughter]. I still remember the
                    meal being half-cooked, and I can't remember how we solved the problem.
                    Eventually, we fed everybody. And then, from that day on for about a couple of
                    months, there was almost never any heat. All the radiators inside the house
                    froze, and the one in the front hall actually burst, because of the freezing
                    temperatures inside. A lot of people died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Romanians, not Americans.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: Romanians. Ceausescu ordered that no baby's birth could be registered
                    until it was six months old. As ill luck would have it, nine months earlier he
                    had ordered everyone to become pregnant. Women had to have three-monthly exams
                    to check on this. So there were an exceptionally high number of births, and an
                    awful lot of newborns died, but they never existed officially. The other problem
                    was that ambulances, because of all the snow, couldn't get easily to people's
                    homes, and there were so many calls on their time. One of Ed's cultural
                    assistants died of a heart attack. She was only in her thirties, but the
                    ambulance couldn't get to the house in time. And then people couldn't be buried,
                    because the ground was frozen through.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: So the bodies either — I didn't see this — the bodies were apparently
                    stacked high. But at some point during all this I was scheduled to go to
                    England, and so once I was there, Ed kept saying, don't come back. Actually, it
                    was quite difficult, because I had no immediate relatives in England. Ed had
                    sent all the USIA dependents away, if they could manage it, but the DCM felt
                    that the American employees should show the Romanians how tough we were.

                <p>McBRIDE: But that being said, Romania was probably our most interesting post. It
                    is extraordinary to have lived under really hard-line Communism, because people
                    don't truly understand what it was like. I've mentioned that we explored the
                    country, and our first two questions when we arrived in a hotel would be: what
                    food do you have? And when is there going to be hot water?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter] In that order.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: Sometimes it was, never. And we would travel with cans of food, because
                    one never knew what, if anything would be available. Our daughters were at
                    school in England all the time that we were in Romania. It was very hard to
                    leave them at the school in Ascot. It was a convent school, and when I was
                    leaving, the nuns obviously realized that I was about to cry, so kindly hurried
                    me on my way. So off I went..... I don't often think “I must have a drink”, and
                    I think it's true to say that at that time, a woman just didn't go into any old
                    pub. [laughter] But my aunt was more or less a teetotaler, so I stopped at the
                    pub, wiped my eyes [laughter] and had a stiff drink before going back to Aunt
                    Mary. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Edward was desperately unhappy his first year at that school. I hadn't
                    realized how unhappy he would be, because the school seemed nice. We had a close
                    friend nearby, whose son had been at the school, and who was taking Edward out
                    from time to time. But he was terribly unhappy; he obviously got more used to it
                    as time went by, and after the first year, he was basically okay; but he didn't
                    like it. On the other hand, without that school, he would never have gone to
                    Eton, and that was an incredible experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that's the other thing. If the children hadn't done
                        that . . . . We had children who stayed in Sierra Leone because their
                        mothers wouldn't part with them. We had three of them. In Sierra Leone, they
                        opened the school to the children of the noncommissioned officers. The
                        officers, the Sierra Leonean officers, many of them had been educated in
                        England.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Oh, really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then they opened the school to children who had never
                        worn shoes or seen indoor plumbing, and they couldn't promise our children
                        space. It wasn't as if just Ruth and Camillo went from the embassy.
                        Everybody went, except these three children, whose mothers wouldn't part
                        with them. Well, one mother never would; and her children were declared
                        unbalanced, because they had no social interchange except with their mother.
                        The other little boy, his mother realized, after a year of having
                        chimpanzees and crews of tribal fishermen as playmates, that it was time for
                        him to go to school. She didn't want to part with him because another son
                        had been killed in an automobile accident, or something, so she wanted Kenny
                        to stay with her. [Recorder turned off.]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: What were we talking about? Whether it was a good thing to have children
                    in boarding school.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you felt there was an added complication of not being
                        both American parents, and maybe you could elaborate on that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Since we were in Eastern Europe, and since I felt that the educational
                    opportunities were better somewhere else and it didn't seem to make much sense
                    to send the children back to the States — and in Edward's case anyway, he was
                    too young — it was sensible to send them to boarding school in England. But I
                    don't know, in retrospect, if that was the right thing, because since I'm
                    English-born, and I didn't actually sound as English then as I do now . . .
                    .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you change that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: I think it was the London assignment. I didn't sound very American
                    before that, but I didn't sound as English as I sound now! [laughter] But that
                    meant, perhaps for our children, that there was a very strong non-American
                    influence. Sarah, our oldest, fought against this and now feels very American. I
                    think Edward can almost feel more American or more English, depending on what's
                    going on at the time. But anyway, given the fact that they are American
                    citizens, I think the foreign influence was too strong, and that was probably
                    promoted by being in an English boarding school. But, of course, hindsight is .
                    . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hindsight is always 20-20. [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: So, education of children is a problem for the foreign service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely, absolutely. I think jobs, education, and
                        housing are the spouse issues, because we always had — it sounds like you
                        did, too — we always had lovely places to live. We had big houses, and nice
                        houses, and interesting houses. And now, even the DCM goes into a two- or
                        three-bedroom apartment, apparently, if their children don't come to post.
                        And by the time you're DCM, it's very likely that your children are in
                        college. And what do you do with them when they come home? This is what I've
                        heard.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: I imagine this is correct. USIS was, I think, probably slightly more
                    flexible about housing arrangements than State. In both Madrid and London, we
                    had to find our own housing, and only the PAO had a house that was always the
                    PAO residence. Although there was a square footage regulation, in Madrid, Edward
                    still counted as though he were living at home, even though he was in boarding
                    school in England. We had to find our own apartment — I thought I'd go mad — I
                    didn't really speak very good Spanish. We searched and searched and searched . .
                    . . And this is the other thing: It's always the spouse that has to do the
                    searching, because the actual employee is busy. . . . . I will say that it does
                    help you to get to know whatever city it happens to be very well. Anyway, we
                    found a beautiful apartment, about the only apartment or house that we ever had,
                    that I seriously would have loved to have owned permanently. But it took ages
                    and ages to find it, and even when we did find it, it needed a lot of work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this is Madrid.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: This is Madrid. And I don't know if we'd been in State that they would
                    have agreed to do work on it. Perhaps so, because they came and did an awful lot
                    for somebody else's house. Housing was a huge problem in Madrid. By the time we
                    got to London, we also had to find our house. And I should know better than to
                    let Ed find the house, when he was on TDY, or something in the U.K. Anyway, I
                    was here in the States, so he found a house that he was very excited about.
                    [laughter] It was a Georgian house. It probably exceeded the space allowance,
                    but it was very inexpensive, so USIS allowed us to have it. It was the most
                    impractical house you could possibly dream of. I hated the house partly because
                    of the colors of the decoration, and it was a terrible house for entertaining:
                    people came in on the first floor, where they left their coats. You then had to
                    take them up to the sitting room floor, which was the second floor. Even if we
                    were having only ten people to dinner, by the time the guests had all arrived, I
                    was already exhausted. [laughter] I'd been up and down the stairs nine times,
                    especially because the kitchen and dining room were in the basement.</p>
                <p>So it was an impossible house for entertaining. But the house and I adjusted to
                    one another. The house belonged to the then British ambassador to The
                    Netherlands, who had sworn to us by all that was holy that he was going to get
                    another ambassadorial assignment after The Netherlands, and therefore we could
                    be in the house for four years. [laughter] Of course, that didn't happen. He
                    announced that he wanted his house back, and we had to find another house.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>This was a time when London house prices were soaring, needless to say, and in
                    the meantime, the regulations had changed. When we went to London we weren't
                    meant to take our furniture. I think that's right. And then, by the time we had
                    to look for this new house, we were supposed to have our furniture. Anyway,
                    again I searched and searched and searched, and Ed eventually went to hospital
                    with severe diverticulitis. I think it was partly stress-induced by the house
                    search. I found one or two houses I thought were okay, and he would say, no, no,
                    you can see the kitchen from the dining room, and things that weren't
                    frightfully important and normally wouldn't bother him. But I looked at seventy
                    houses or apartments, and eventually, we found a house, which was brilliant for
                    entertaining. It wasn't nearly as attractive or as historic but practical. But
                    it exceeded the space regulations, because by this time, Edward was in college.
                    However, Ed had been in hospital, and we'd looked, as I told you, at seventy
                    houses [laughter], and so the admin counselor let us have the house. I had been
                    acting housing officer for a certain amount of time in Madrid, and I think
                    housing policy — I don't know how much it's changed- in Madrid was desperately
                    bad when I was housing office, which was a couple of years after we'd
                    arrived.</p>
                <p>The Spanish wanted to rent to Americans, but regulations were impossible. In one
                    case, I remember, the budget and fiscal officer, who was a single man, found
                    this brilliant apartment that exceeded the space regulations, but which the
                    landlady was prepared to let him have at a steal price; but he wasn't allowed to
                    have it. We lost the lease. And it was frustrating to try to find people
                    housing, and then, when you found them a house that they liked, not to be
                    allowed to rent it for them because it exceeded the space regulations, even if
                    it was in the fiscal allowance. I think it was totally ridiculous!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems to me that you could have taken the space, taken
                        the allotment, calculated that the allotment pays for this much space, and
                        if you wanted to go over, you pay for that much yourself. Wouldn't they do
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: They wouldn't do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, come on!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: I can't remember how it worked. When people were prepared to pay the
                    difference, they weren't allowed to do so on the grounds that it would seem
                    unfair, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know how you would calculate the difference. You
                        were only allowed so much space.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: No matter what.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. So they had to pay for that extra space, and then you
                        had to assess the rent across the whole space, consider how much rent they
                        owed for the space they were allotted, and then let them pay the
                        difference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: I quite agree. No, I don't know if they would have done that. I didn't
                    even think of that, but I imagine that. . . . Oh, this was the other thing. If
                    somebody signed a lease in Spain, you had, I think, a week or ten days, to
                    renege on it. And the housing situation was such that if it were out there on
                    the local market, which it often was (I would look through the newspaper ads
                    each morning) then you had to say, yes, I want it immediately. But then you had,
                    I think, a week or something in which to withdraw. In that week, somebody from
                    GSO would have to go and measure the house — so you'd lost a day right there,
                    even if they could go the next day — send the cable back to Washington, and
                    Washington would then send a cable back saying “ No, they can't have the house.”
                    Oh, they might say yes, depending on the space. But it often took more than a
                    week, so we lost houses that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was someone in Washington who had no idea how hard
                        it was to get . . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Well, they must have known, but anyway, yes, it was somebody in
                    Washington. It was so frustrating and so stupid! Were they afraid of jealousy? I
                    don't know. My understanding was — I'm not up-to-date on it — was that both in
                    London and in Madrid, heads of sections, regardless of their family size, were
                    entitled to special housing. . . . The regulations were waived. There was a PAO
                    house in London and a PAO apartment in Madrid. But maybe it does apply to
                    everybody from the DCM on down now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was my understanding, but now, you know, it's been a
                        long time since I have even been over to the State Department. I don't know
                        what it is now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: I don't know, but it wasn't as bad for the most senior officers
                    beforehand.</p>
                <p>Q: When we could pick out our own houses, those were the ones I liked. I never
                    liked any of the embassy houses, because you always had an administrative
                    officer who was looking at the upkeep and how the plumbing was and the roof. I
                    want charm. I want something old. So, when we could pick our own houses, those
                    were the three we liked best, and the three that were picked for us were the
                    three we didn't like. McBRIDE: In the last resort, certainly in Paris, where we
                    had this lovely apartment, and in Madrid and London, I was glad we picked our
                    own. But it was extremely hard to search. Actually, because I'd had such a hard
                    time in Spain with almost no help from the housing office, that's why I wanted
                    to work there myself. . . . I don't know what the problem was when we arrived.
                    There wasn't a housing officer, or they'd left, or something . . . . So much
                    later on, I began working in the embassy as the housing assistant
                    (so-called—there wasn't a housing officer) and worked desperately hard. I've
                    never had a more hardworking job, I don't think. But it was so rewarding,
                    because I did succeed in finding people housing, and it made my Spanish much
                    better. It was fun. I also got to know far more embassy people than I might have
                    done otherwise, which was also fun. But I left the housing office job to become
                    CLO, and I'd never been a CLO before. So that was very interesting.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do, mainly, as a CLO? What role did CLO fill
                        at the post? Cultural? Mother confessor? All of the above?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Maybe West European embassies are harder for families, in many ways,
                    than other embassies and smaller embassies like Bucharest or Sierra Leone,
                    simply because people aren't so friendly. When families arrived in Madrid,
                    housing was a problem. To some extent, the school was a problem. I guess people
                    always complain about American schools, if you see what I mean, so I was a
                    mother confessor from that point of view. But the worst thing about Madrid, from
                    the family's point of view, was that people felt very isolated. It was a very
                    rapidly expanding city at the time. Families tended sometimes to live out near
                    the American school, which, depending on the traffic could seem far from
                    downtown and the Embassy. . .I worked on and off for all kinds of things in
                    Madrid, and taught at the American school for a semester. If I left the house at
                    about seven o'clock in the morning, I could get to the school in about twenty
                    minutes from an apartment downtown. But, when I was returning from school in the
                    afternoon, it would often take me at least an hour. So if you were in the
                    suburbs, you had a serious traffic problem to confront. It wasn't really an
                    enormously friendly embassy. Section chiefs didn't necessarily entertain their
                    staff, and there was no way, in many cases, for embassy people to get to know
                    one another. And that, to some extent, was true of London, as well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that because of the personalities of the individuals,

                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: It's a big city and a big embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you're in Europe, and people can travel, and Spanish
                        is fairly easy to conquer, I think, as a language. And they didn't need each
                        other on a day-to-day basis, like you did in Senegal and we, in
                        Freetown.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: But the funny part was people did need one another. And somebody said to
                    me fairly early on in my arrival, “I've been so unhappy here. I often don't get
                    up until twelve o'clock, because there's nothing to get up for.” I thought, “Oh,
                    my goodness! This is going to be perfectly dreadful! I must make sure I involve
                    myself in as many things as possible, so that I don't feel like not getting up!”
                    But it was easy, in a way, because we were in the center of town and, once
                    again, there were wonderful museums. I became enormously interested in Spanish
                    art and history, and I wasn't particularly afraid of getting behind the wheel of
                    a car, even if Ed couldn't go to wherever I was going for the day. Madrid,
                    however, was the hardest post for me to adapt to. The Spanish hours, first of
                    all, are very difficult; and secondly, a Spaniard's home really is his castle.
                    It took a very long time to be invited to Spanish homes, and a very long time to
                    get to know a couple as opposed to the professional contact. The main entry to
                    knowing Spanish people was obviously through Ed. It was a bit like Dakar in one
                    sense, in that if you invited a couple to dinner — once again, normally the
                    husband — the husband would accept. He might say his wife wasn't coming, but he
                    often wouldn't mention this. [laughter] If you were having people to dinner you
                    never knew how many people would actually come; but it was a safe bet that most
                    wives wouldn't come. We succeeded in staying in Spain for four and a half years,
                    and mainly in the last six months, I finally got to know a lot of wives. And the
                    thing that was so fascinating was that a lot of them were professional, highly
                    educated women, who would say, knowing we were about to leave, oh, if only we'd
                    met earlier! [laughter] I often wondered if they ever even knew that they'd been
                    invited to dinner, and their husbands simply had not [told them]. So, for people
                    coming to the embassy, it was difficult to get to know the Spanish. Americans
                    might not know the language, and might be out in the suburbs, and there didn't
                    seem to be a lot of embassy support. So, one of the things that we tried to do
                    in CLO was organize activities. I can't remember why, but there wasn't a proper
                    Marine TGIF, which I think is a very good way for people to get to know one
                    another. Once again, it was held somewhere else, not at the embassy. Anyway, the
                    co-CLO and I — she had much more experience than I did; she'd been a CLO before.
                    — anyway, we decided that we would get together a TGIF at the Embassy, which was
                    a huge success and did mean that at least people got to know one another. But
                    there was no budget for this, so we thought we would solve the problem. I think
                    we may at first have put in our own money. I can't remember how we did it. We
                    bought the wine. The ambassador's wife very kindly donated canap�s and things
                    that she had left over. The ambassador's wife was a very pleasant woman, but she
                    was a political appointee, and she was very unhappy in Madrid. She wasn't into
                    doing things to boost embassy morale, so that wasn't easy either. But she
                    donated canap�s and so on and so forth. And we would charge everybody — I can't
                    remember — fifty cents a drink, or something. Well, this went on nicely, and we
                    could pay back what we'd paid for the wine and buy more, and we made a profit.
                    This all went along brilliantly. We were lucky to have a wonderful admin
                    counselor, who's still a close friend, but he's very much a details person.
                    Whether he turned a blind eye, on all this, or whether . . . . I don't know.
                    Anyway, eventually someone came along to inspect and said we weren't allowed to
                    make a profit [laughter]!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, but you plowed the profit back in. You didn't take it
                        out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: No, no, no! We plowed it back in, but that still meant . . . . I mean,
                    we had a money box. But after several months. we had, I don't know, forty
                    dollars, or something, in the money box.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were just recycling the money!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Yes, well, anyway, we weren't allowed to do it. But that must have
                    happened just as we were both leaving, so I really don't know what happened
                    after that. [laughter]</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember something about the Marine. . . . Yes, I'll
                        tell you what it was. We were doing something like that at the Marine house
                        in Trinidad. We were selling goods at the Marine house, and someone locally,
                        who had a bar, brought this to the attention of the authorities because we
                        were underselling . . . You know, with duty-free alcohol we could undersell
                        the bars. And there again, I forget what they did. Oh, they sent flyers
                        around Port of Spain, saying that the Marines were illegally selling alcohol
                        at their Friday night parties, and cutting into the business of the local
                        bartenders.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: I don't think it was. It was something to do with U.S. regulations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, maybe we were violating U.S. regulations, and the
                        Trinidadians picked up on it! [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Somehow, I thought the Marine house always could serve alcohol at
                    parties, because that's the main way they make money for the Marine ball.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was something like that, because the flyer was
                        circulated in Port of Spain about these Americans destroying the bar
                        industry in — I forget what our area was called. We were right near the
                        embassy and right in town.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Well, at least we didn't have the Spanish up in arms. Nobody was really
                    up in arms about it, actually. I wish I could remember what finally happened.
                    So, anyway, that was one thing we did. We were big advocates for employment. We
                    dealt with a variety of people's problems. There was a lot of liaison. I feel
                    that, as CLOs, we really shouldn't have been escorting VIPs, but this was the
                    time that Spain was really building up both for the Olympics in Barcelona and
                    for the World's Fair in Seville. So there were lots of American visitors we had
                    to either take around ourselves or arrange to have taken around. I also spent a
                    lot of time on education issues. There were a few problems at the American
                    school, and so I was trying to tell people about other schools, and help. And
                    then, it was also a medevac post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, we used to be medevaced from Rabat to
                        Torrejon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: And so I had to help people not . . . . I sometimes had to find them a
                    place to stay. But some of the medevacs were amazingly demanding. For example if
                    they had brought a small child with them, then I had to help arrange for the
                    small child to have care while the mother was having the baby, if you see what I
                    mean. I got left with lots of problems. There was lots of variety.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Things that you really couldn't solve on your own!
                        [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: It was a very busy job. One thing I found interesting about it was
                    learning more of the inner workings of an embassy. But because morale had been
                    so bad and people literally didn't meet one another, I was concentrating most on
                    helping embassy spouses. I keep on saying “I,” but my co-CLO should share any
                    credit I got. She taught me a lot, and we worked together on everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had one situation, where a group — when I was CLO — when
                        a group of boy scouts — and, you know, there were twenty, thirty of them —
                        somehow the ambassador got them to the embassy. I'm not quite sure. It was a
                        rainy day. They couldn't do what they were supposed to be doing that day
                        because it was pouring. So, they were sitting around the embassy all day
                        long. Well, the ambassador said, send them over to the snack bar! Well, I
                        went right up to the admin officer and I said, look, I'm not paying to take
                        care of those boy scouts all day long. There's no FLO allowance for that.
                        And, I said, what are you going to do about it? Well, the ambassador was so
                        tight. He died at the post, actually. But they were just saving everything,
                        every penny that they could because he was retiring after that. He wasn't
                        career; he was a political ambassador. And I don't know how the admin
                        officer settled it. I don't know who paid for it. The admin officer probably
                        found some . . . . He was very good at doing things that were just, just
                        skirting the law! And he was very good about that. [laughter] And I don't
                        know who took care of that, but that ambassador really just dumped those
                        kids in my lap, with, oh, let the CLO pay for it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: But CLO had no allowance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No! No! And I'm sure the ambassador knew that, but that
                        didn't make any difference. The ambassador in Sierra Leone used to borrow
                        Scotch, bourbon, what have you from our DCM all the time, and he never paid
                        him back.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Really?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the DCM was essentially subsidizing the ambassador's
                        parties and things, because — and I'm not making this up — he borrowed
                        liquor all the time from the DCM&gt;</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: How incredible!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was incredible. And after the DCM left, he borrowed
                        from us a couple of times until the other DCM arrived. They didn't overlap.
                        It was amazing! And I said, Guido, . . . [laughter] It was just amazing to
                        me how people . . . . whether they would change overseas, but sometimes
                        their latent, real-person would surface in a stressful situation. It was a
                        little stressful, living in a foreign language and a foreign culture.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Yes, and I think it was stressful for people in Spain, because a lot of
                    people hadn't had language training before they came.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's such a mistake. That is so shortsighted to cut back
                        on language training funding.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Yes. I presume that all the actual embassy foreign service officers and
                    most of the support staff had had some language training, but that still meant .
                    . . .And it's actually the spouses, who are left at home. . .</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because Guido always had an interpreter if he really had a

                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: I used to shriek at Ed about the womb of the embassy [laughter] while I
                    was left struggling at home. [laughter] But although the actual officer there
                    must obviously, find the new job stressful, there's something reassuring about
                    walking into an American embassy where, unless it's your first post, some things
                    are always going to be the same.</p>
                <p>

                        host-country friends who'd had the same maid for thirty years, or even six
                        years! [laughter] And the same person to take care of your children, because

                <p>McBRIDE: Exactly. Oh, I know what I was going to say. It amazed me that the
                    Madrid job as CLO was so different it was from being CLO in London. The London
                    CLO was almost not social at all. London had many more medevacs, massive school
                    problems, and, by this time, many more reports also. I can't remember how many
                    reports I had to send back. I think there was a quarterly report. There was an
                    education report. For some reason or other I was often doing a lot of work with
                    the budget and fiscal officer. For most of the time I was the only CLO in
                    London, and it was extremely hard work. Once again, it was very interesting,
                    because I learned about all kinds of regulations, reports, offices' budget and
                    fiscal matters that I never would otherwise have known about. But, on the other
                    hand, there probably should have been a budget for more CLO hours, or two CLO
                    people. In London, I was lucky, in fact. The CLO before me, and all CLOs since
                    me, have been lucky in that a former embassy employee, Gloria, who retired to
                    spend time with her husband, decided, when her husband suddenly died, to come
                    back to the embassy as a volunteer. She's still volunteering to this very day in
                    the CLO office, for three days a week, I think. So she deals with a lot of
                    enquiries from people who want to know about tourist sights, for example.
                    Sometimes, Americans visiting either Madrid or, in this case, London, who have
                    nothing to do with the embassy just call in and want tourist information. And
                    it's all very well to tell them that the office is only supposed to help embassy
                    employees. How do you do that without . . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can't, without offending them, because you're
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: The reaction of many Americans would be, well, I'm a tax-paying American
                    citizen [text obscured by laughter] Anyway, London was completely different with
                    far less organizing of activities. The most important activity was a party in
                    the fall for newcomers. We would get lots of different London organizations to
                    come in and set up stalls, mainly with information that was useful for London.
                    It was like a fair at which wine was served. I think it must have been donated.
                    There was a raffle too. That was really the main semi-social thing I did as CLO
                    in London. One honestly couldn't have pulled it all together without Gloria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to ask you one question. If you medevac somebody
                        from London, where do you send them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: They were all being sent to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, yes. I probably misunderstood. But my first
                        thought was, where do you send them from there? [laughter] And the
                        education? Didn't they all go to the public schools? By public, I mean
                        public in the British sense. No, they all went to American schools?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Well, no. Most children off high school-age went to the American
                    schools, but London has such a wealth of schools of all types . . . . But the
                    other thing is that London is one of the places — and certainly the place that
                    most people choose — where, if you have a special needs child particularly major
                    learning or medical needs — London has schools that cater for such children,
                    and, for example, very good programs for autistic children, and so on. So I who
                    really knew very little about schools for children with special medical needs
                    spent a great deal of time on that, probably because I had to learn all about
                    it. But probably most new CLO's would have had to learn all about special
                    schools etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I think so.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: At the elementary and middle school levels, people didn't necessarily
                    choose the American school. And anyway, there are about four or five American
                    schools, just day schools, and then you've got boarding schools as well. So
                    education was very time-consuming. But London . . . . I was furious when Ed
                    announced we were going to London! [laughter} Absolutely furious! Because, I
                    said “we've had children in school in England, and I know about London, so why
                    are we going to London? You're in the foreign service to go to new places.” But
                    anyway, he wanted London, and I hadn't realized that the life I'd led — as a
                    perfectly ordinary person living about thirty miles from London as a child, and
                    as a young girl — was totally different from being at the embassy, because we
                    attended events and met people whom I would never normally have met. The
                    highlight social event was the diplomatic ball at Buckingham Palace. I couldn't
                    believe I was there! Each Embassy was only allowed x number of people. I can't
                    remember if the Americans had ten people. So you could only go in your last
                    year, and you had to be pretty senior to be on the list to attend. So we were
                    very lucky to go, and it was an amazing experience. The only trouble was that I
                    felt that we could have just as well been there in Victoria's reign, or in the
                    early 1900s, because so little had changed. Gloves reaching above the elbow. All
                    kinds of protocol that had to be observed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to back away from the Queen, in high heels?
                        [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: No, it's not like that. You stand in country groups in reception rooms.
                    . . . Unfortunately, the ambassador was a fairly new arrival, so America was low
                    in the order of precedence, which meant that we were about the ninetieth group
                    she came to. . We must have stood there for, honestly, I think, an hour, all
                    dressed up. I thought that was bad, because some quite elderly ambassadors and
                    their wives were there, and they also had to stand for all that time. But after
                    meeting the Queen, we all went off for a very delicious buffet-supper in one of
                    the reception rooms. We had the run of the palace, which, of course, has
                    fabulous portraits and things to look at. So we rather concentrated on that. But
                    we were near the end of the supper anyway, because the first countries in the
                    order of precedence got to go in right away, after meeting the Queen, Prince
                    Philip, and Prince Charles and Prince Andrew. I can't remember who else was
                    there, but several members of the royal family. Although you're introduced to
                    the Queen, she's really concentrating on talking with the ambassador and the
                    DCM. But it's still nice to have been able to curtsey and be really up close.
                    Andrew talked to the group, but was quite charming and quite naive in that he
                    said to one of us, “Oh, you must drop by sometime, [laughter] so that we can
                    talk about this!” [laughter] Nobody had exchanged cards or anything. He didn't
                    seem to realize that wasn't easy, but this was all a long time ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old was he then? He couldn't have been very old.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Well, 1995. I haven't the foggiest idea how old he would have been.</p>

                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Anyway, we got to go to Palace garden parties, to Ascot, to places like
                    Glyndebourne. It was a whole different . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Life style.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: And the other thing was that Ed had known London, in a sense, as an
                    outsider, but he got to know it as somebody who lives in London. So now, we go
                    back to London often, and as it happens, two of our children are there, one
                    temporarily. And our grandchildren. So we go back and we feel very comfortable.
                    And we have — I refer to them as “new” friends — we have friends now that we
                    made when we were at the embassy in the '90s. We've been very lucky in our
                    postings. But I have to go back to my initial notes from your questions. The
                    issue of language we sort of touched on. Another issue for spouses is loneliness
                    on arrival at post, especially large posts, which is why I think CLO is so
                    important. But I hope that the CLO, in the end, especially at large posts,
                    doesn't get drowned in paperwork and education and housing issues. I had to go
                    to meetings of the housing committee. I had to go to meetings of the employment
                    committee. That, plus individual contacts and reports and so on, make it far
                    more difficult for the CLO to maintain a proper contact with each new arrival
                    and make sure that they aren't lonely and that they are meeting other wives and
                    so on and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's a book that Sally gave me, a little paperback
                        called Diplomatic Baggage. Did you read it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: I have a copy of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, right at the beginning, when she arrives at that new
                        post, that loneliness! You have nothing to do. You've left your family,
                        maybe, and especially after your children no longer go with you. You arrive
                        at post. You don't know anybody, the language. You don't know where anything
                        is. Your husband goes off to the embassy. There you are with a staff that
                        you don't know, you're trying to communicate with. And she captured it so
                        perfectly in the first few paragraphs of that book. You almost don't have to
                        read any further, because a lot is typical anecdotes. We all have the
                        anecdotes from different countries, slightly different, but that loneliness
                        when you first arrive! I had even in our next to last post, which was
                        Recife! And after we had flown to Brasilia so that Guido could check in at
                        the embassy, and then to fly up to the northeast. When you look at Brazil
                        it's a big country, and it's a long way up to Recife and the consulate. And
                        I got there and, you know, I'd been a foreign service wife for how many
                        years now? And my feeling was, what am I doing here and what am I going to
                        do here?</hi>

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: How many other Americans were there?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's see. We had . . . . It was mostly the business
                        people. We had Alcoa. We had USIS. We had the Peace Corps when we arrived,
                        but they eventually left. We had General Motors. We had the missionaries. I
                        don't know. Did you have missionaries in Senegal? Southern Baptist
                        missionaries? McBRIDE: We did. Missionaries always amaze me! And the ones in
                        Senegal were especially fascinating . . . there were Mormon missionaries,
                        too; and these poor kids would come . . . They didn't speak Wolof and they
                        didn't speak French. So they had no way to convert anyone. And Senegal was
                        pretty basic. You couldn't buy very much. So I would always invite them in
                        to tea if I wasn't busy, and try and find why they were there at all!
                        [laughter] But they were never much good at converting anybody. I don't
                        think they even tried with me. I think I probably said, “well, why don't you
                        have a cup of tea? Now, tell me who you are and why you are here!”
                        [laughter] But we didn't have much contact with missionary families. We had
                        a lot of contact with the Peace Corps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Peace Corps was being phased out and AID was
                        practically gone, and they were phasing out . . . . Guido really went out to
                        save Recife, because they were phasing out a lot of consulates. And he was
                        adamant that they weren't going to close it. Now Brazil is absolutely
                        booming!</hi>

                <p>McBRIDE: So it's now a large consulate?</p>

                        At the time you could see that it was the Brazil of tomorrow, but at the
                        embassy they were very wound up in what was going on in Brasilia. We still
                        had the generals, one of the generals. A lot of the bad things had
                        stopped.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: But the embassy already was in Brasilia. When did it move? I've
                    forgotten now. Was it the '60s?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know, '60s or '70s. Even when we were there, in
                        the late '70s and '80s, the Brazilians would all evacuate Brasilia on Friday
                        afternoon and go to Rio for the weekend. If you had a family in Brasilia,
                        great camping. It was great for families, but for the single women it was
                        something of a challenge. You know, it was an artificial city. As someone
                        said, there were no dirty old corners. [laughter] So actually, being up in
                        the northeast, we, and then the Hartleys, Doug and Sandra Hartley, were in
                        Bahia; and we had pretty much the same situation. We really had the old
                        Brazil, and really saw more of the way Brazil was in the northeast then, and
                        had been, you know, in the past, in the northeast.</hi>

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: So your other friends were in Salvador? In Bahia? How far away is
                    this?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, well, we could drive it in day. I drove it once. But
                        otherwise, we flew down. But we didn't go too often. No, but Doug had the
                        consulate, and Guido had the consulate in Recife.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Oh, really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also, we had a house in town, in the neighborhood that
                        was beginning to become commercial, and we had this gorgeous beach, Boa
                        Viagem, but it was a good drive out to the beach. Everybody else in the
                        consular corps lived out on the beach, practically, except us. And so I was
                        constantly agitating to move. Well, Guide felt it was more important to save
                        the consulate than to move us to the beach . . . He didn't like living in
                        apartments anyway. You had to live in an apartment, almost, in Boa Viagem.
                        And then, I found a house out there, and, as I've mentioned many times, they
                        wouldn't let us have it. The DCM . . . well, we used to see him every
                        Christmas, at a party, and it was all I could do to be civil to him!
                        [laughter] Even now! [laughter] They were all looking out for themselves in
                        Brasilia, you know. [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The embassy said that the security was . . . . The house
                        was by itself! Was by itself! And the one in town was the one that was a
                        security problem, because someone could have dropped a bomb over the garden
                        fence and sped away in a car. I think the problem was that not far away
                        there was a high apartment building where someone could have gone up on the
                        roof and picked me off in my garden. [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Probably. Well, I suppose that they think of all these things far more
                    carefully than I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think so. DO any wives go along in the Middle East
                        anymore? I don't think so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Oh, don't you think so?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have 700 unaccompanied positions, and a lot of them are
                        in the Middle East.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>McBRIDE: I don't know. I've never even asked about that. When we were visiting
                    Syria last year, we met the American charg�, I guess he's called, officially
                    under the auspices of the Swiss. We met him and his wife, and he staggered me by
                    saying his “staff of fifty American employees”! [laughter] And I wondered what
                    in the world could fifty employees . . . !</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we're going to run out of tape. This will just
                        about take us to the end, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Okay, well, I'll recount this traumatic experience or Sally will be
                    cross . . . . [laughter] We were on our way back to Dakar from home leave, so
                    Charlotte was still in a carry basket, aged six months, and Sarah was in a
                    pushchair, aged eighteen months. And the weather was very, very wet. We flew up
                    from Savannah, and our landing was very delayed, as all the planes were backed
                    up at JFK. When we landed, we needed to go to the Pan Am terminal to leave all
                    our bags, but we had flown in on National Airlines, I think. Because of the
                    backup and the weather, there were no limos. Eventually, an Alitalia limousine
                    pulled up, and the driver presumably saw this forlorn little group with small
                    children and lots of luggage. And so he said, “I'll take you to the Pan Am
                    terminal!” He put all the luggage in the back, and Charlotte was in the carry
                    basket on the backseat, and Ed and Sarah and I were on the next seat. We got to
                    the newly built Pan Am terminal, which was chaos, and so he couldn't pull up
                    under the entrance awning because of the taxi lines because of the rain. Anyway,
                    Ed told me to run on in with Sarah. So I get Sarah into the pushchair and run on
                    under the awning, watching. Ed gets out all the luggage, and slams down the door
                    at the back. The driver forgets about Charlotte on the back seat, accelerates
                    because he was in an illegal stopping point, [laughter], and drives away.
                    [laughter] Well, I was furious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't there, though, were you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Well, I saw him drive off. I saw exactly what was happening! I was
                    standing under the awning, watching, and sort of desperate and, as usual, when
                    you're about to go — in this case — back to post, exhausted. Ed gets the luggage
                    and Sarah and me inside the terminal, where it was so new that there was nowhere
                    to sit down — I remember sitting on a suitcase [laughter] for hours — and Ed
                    went off to deal with the Pan Am people, whose only interest seemed to be why we
                    were in neither a Pan Am limousine nor a National Airlines limousine. And I kept
                    on thinking, “You lose luggage for weeks. We're never going to see our baby
                    alive again!” But then I sort of tuned out, and went and sat on the suitcases
                    for ages or pushed Sarah round in the pushchair. And I was also cross with
                    everyone. . . . Ed was clearly upset, but it clearly wasn't Ed's fault. It was
                    nobody's fault, really, but I, of course, was cross with the PanAm bureaucrats
                    [laughter]. In the meantime, I remember that this frightfully glamorous woman
                    with yellow coat, yellow suede high-heeled boots, was trying to pick up Ed, as
                    he paced around, up and down. [laughter] She really started chatting him up.
                    Anyway, I should think about an hour later, the Alitalia limousine driver shows
                    up, roaring with laughter, saying, “We got this announcement over the intercom
                    saying, 'Will everyone check their cars to make sure they don't have a baby left
                    behind in a carry basket!' “ [laughter] Said the driver, “I thought, ho, ho, ho,
                    who'd be silly enough not to notice they had a baby in their limo? And then he
                    thought, funny, I had a couple with a baby in a carry basket.” And he looked
                    around, and, sure enough, there was Charlotte! But apparently, he'd given a lot
                    of people rides in between times, before we persuaded Pan Am to do something,
                    and Alitalia had got around to contacting their drivers. . . . . But, of course,
                    all the passengers thought it was another passenger's baby, so no one had said
                    anything, and she had slept soundly through it all. But I was very happy to see
                    her!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weren't you frantic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: I was frantic at first, but when things really are bad, something shuts
                    down inside me, and I literally tune out! [laughter] So, having vented my
                    spleen, as they say . . . . [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The best thing to do, really, because there's no point in
                        getting hysterical.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Well, I was hysterical, briefly, but then all you could really do was
                    wait. I probably would have got hysterical if we'd waited, let's say, three
                    hours.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were getting ready to board the plane.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>McBRIDE: Well, no we weren't, which was good. The whole reason we had to leave
                    our luggage at the terminal was that we were spending the night with a cousin,
                    just outside New York. But once we got Charlotte back, it turned out to be a
                    funny story. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think that's a good note to end on.</hi>
