                <p>CAROLINE S. SERVICE</p>
                <p>Interviewed by Jewell Fenzi</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 10, 1987</p>
                <p>SERVICE: I'd like to talk a little about Peking when we lived there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's exactly what I'd love to hear.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: It was a fascinating place to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now at what time was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: 1935 to 1937. We were there when the Japanese came in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, actually your husband had been a China specialist
                        before that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Jack was born in China. He and I were classmates in college. We both
                    went to Oberlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: And then he passed the Foreign Service exams in 1933. It was the same
                    year that U. Alexis Johnson and John Emmerson and Ed Rice and many of our other
                    friends did. But there were no appointments made because of the Depression. So,
                    as we wanted very much to get married, Jack went out to China, where he had
                    grown up, to get a job. He went into the Consulate in Shanghai to see if there
                    was anything going that he could do. Before long he was told that there was a
                    clerkship open in Kunming which, in those days, we called Yunnanfu. (I am going
                    to use these two names interchangeably.) Would Jack take this job? He was
                    overjoyed as it would pay $1,800 a year and we could get married. I went out to
                    Shanghai with Jack's mother, and from there I traveled to Haiphong, on my own,
                    by ship. This trip took about ten days by coastal steamer. We went through a
                    typhoon and had to stay anchored at Hoihow, on the island of Hainan, for about
                    three days.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>The ship arrived at Haiphong shortly before four on the afternoon of November 9,
                    which was a Thursday. Jack, who had come down from Yunnanfu, was waiting for me.
                    We had to rush right up to the Hotel de Ville to be married by the Mayor of
                    Haiphong before 5 p.m. because a three-day holiday was starting the next day. I
                    might add that we had both had to do a great deal of preparatory paper work in
                    order to be married under French law. The brief ceremony was in French, of which
                    we understood little (we had an interpreter), and then we were handed our
                    official marriage document which had room for the names of 12 children! We shook
                    hands all round and that was that. Our witnesses were a Mr. and Mrs. Page,
                    almost the only Americans living in Haiphong at that time. I don't know how this
                    was arranged. Afterwards we had champagne at the home of the Pages and then went
                    out to dinner. But before this we had sent cables to our parents that we were
                    married. And I had Jack put the wedding ring on my finger. I had brought it with
                    me from Washington. There was no place in the civil service for the ring. Jack
                    was just 24 and I was still 23.</p>
                <p>We spent that night in the flat of one of the other Americans in Haiphong: a
                    bachelor who was away. He and Mr. Page worked for some oil company, maybe
                    Standard Oil. I'm not sure.</p>
                <p>The next morning, very early, Jack and I took the French train for the three-day
                    trip to Yunnanfu. The train ran only during the day which meant that we had to
                    spend two nights in small, primitive railway hotels. Lunch was served on the
                    trains. The scenery, as we rose from the coastal flats of Indo-China to the
                    6,000-foot altitude of Kunming, was spectacular. But as the train — a
                    narrow-gauge, open-windowed, uncomfortable wooden vehicle — chugged slowly
                    through and up and over the landscape, I'm afraid I didn't appreciate it as much
                    as I should have. I know that I thought I'd come to a wild, remote part of the
                    world, and in many ways I had. We spent two years in Kunming, and then Jack was
                    assigned to Peking for language study. In the fall of 1935, the Foreign Service
                    appointments had finally come through, and Jack was Unclassified C at $2,500 a
                    year. That was wonderful. The first step in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was 1935.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. Jack already spoke Chinese, but he didn't read or write it so he
                    went to language school and then studied Chinese with teachers for two years. Ed
                    Rice was also a beginning language student at this time, and Jim Penfield was
                    finishing his course.</p>
                <p>Living in Peking was an Arabian Nights experience. In retrospect I realize that I
                    never heard anyone mention that we might be at the end of an era. Nobody was
                    worried. We all thought we were going to go on living in China forever. Then the
                    Japanese War started on July 7, 1937. But I'll talk a bit more about Peking if
                    you want.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd love you to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: We got to Peking in early December, Jack and I, from Yunnanfu, with our
                    baby, Virginia, who was just about five months old. A few days after we arrived
                    there were so-called student uprisings. (Harbingers of things to come, but I
                    certainly did not know that.) The students were protesting the Japanese
                    encroachment on Chinese territory which had been going on for some years. Japan
                    now controlled Manchuria and was making further demands on the Chinese.</p>
                <p>At that time there were two capitals in China, at Peking and at Nanking. Nanking
                    was the official capital, but as all the embassies had residences in Peking, and
                    as foreigners much preferred living in Peking, most of the families just lived
                    there. And most of the embassy personnel too. The Ambassador spent some time in
                    each city, and there was a small permanent staff in Nanking. But as far as
                    diplomatic life went it was in Peking. Foreigners still did pretty much what
                    they wanted in China in those days.</p>
                <p>Nelson T. Johnson was the Minister when we arrived, but he was very soon given
                    the rank of Ambassador. His wife, Jane Johnson, everyone loved dearly. She was
                    marvelous to all of us. The number two was Frank Lockhart, and his wife, Ruby,
                    whom nobody called Ruby. They were very formal, but they were angels. Mr.
                    Lockhart was one of the kindest men I've ever known. And Mrs. Lockhart was
                    interested in everybody — they were wonderful to all of us. And then there was
                    Larry Salisbury who was a Japan language man. He was a bachelor and he had his
                    mother with him. There was Bob Smyth, also a bachelor. All these people lived in
                    the Embassy compound, adjacent to the Chancery and next door to the Marine Guard
                    Compound.</p>
                <p>Then in San Kuan Miao, an old temple compound that the American Embassy owned,
                    there were Mariann and Edmund Clubb, Harriet and Paul Meyer, Elsie and Cecil
                    Lyon, George Merrell, and Phil Sprouse. And then there were the language
                    students, Jim Penfield, Ed Rice, and later Troy Perkins. Besides the Embassy
                    families some others who became life-long friends were Sam and Belle Griffith,
                    Bob and Cary Luckey, and Ed and Flip Sutherland.</p>
                <p>Sam was a Marine language student. He and Belle were the most glamorous couple
                    I've ever known. Bob Luckey was stationed with the Marine Guard. Ed Sutherland
                    was an Army language student. The year I lived in New Delhi he and his wife,
                    Flip, lived just two doors away from me. It was Flip who took Philip to the
                    Delhi Gymkhana Club where he learned how to swim. Ed was the Military Attach� at
                    the Embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Because we had children, and because Charles Millet, another first year language
                    student, and his wife had children, we two families had to make our own living
                    arrangements. For the first two months we were in Peking we lived in the Lyons'
                    house, which they kindly loaned to us while they were on leave. This was a
                    perfect arrangement for us — we followed an old Peking custom of “boarding with
                    the cook,” and the amah who had taken care of Alice Lyon now took care of Ginny.
                    When Elsie and Cecil came back from leave they brought a nurse with them and the
                    amah stayed with us. Later, when Bob was born, the amah's daughter came to help
                    out. I cannot stress enough how good our Chinese servants were to us.</p>
                <p>When we needed a place of our own, Jack and I rented a house out near Coal Hill,
                    right across the street from the north wall of the Forbidden City. The house is
                    still there, and when we go back to Peking Jack and I always take a look at the
                    outside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How nice.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: The house is now lived in by some official. It was owned in those days
                    by a German businessman and his wife. Jack's brother Dick had gotten a job in
                    the Consulate in Foochow. Their father had died in September of 1935 and their
                    mother had gone to live with Dick. Shortly after that Dick found out that he had
                    tuberculosis of the intestines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, dear.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: So Dick and his mother came to live with us in Peking, and Dick spent
                    about a month in the Peking Union Medical College hospital undergoing tests.
                    Grace Service, of course, was with us. My mother-in-law and I had a fine
                    relationship. In the spring the doctor advised us to move to the Western Hills
                    to escape from the dust of Peking. We rented a good-sized house, sublet the
                    house in town, and all moved out to the Western Hills, taking the servants with
                    us. Mrs. Service hired a male nurse for Dick who just stayed in bed all day.
                    Today no one stays in bed, but Dick made a perfect recovery. Jack's Chinese
                    teacher came out every day on the bus and went home in the late afternoon by
                    bus. We stayed at the Western Hills from the middle of May until the first of
                    October.</p>
                <p>I'd become pregnant at the Western Hills and was expecting my second child in
                    February. Elsie Lyon was expecting her second child in January. About Christmas
                    time two other very pregnant Foreign Service wives had come to Peking to have
                    their babies. (I think their names were Betty Allen and Sandra Grummon.) We made
                    a picturesque foursome, all of us in Chinese embroidered Mandarin coats worn
                    over our clothes! Red ones, as I remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have Chinese doctors? Did you have the babies at
                        home?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SERVICE: No, I had a Canadian doctor at the PUMC [Interview</p>
                <p>So, he came to Peking and was in the Rockefeller Hospital, the PUMC [Peking Union
                    Medical College]. Actually my first child, Ginny, born in Yunnanfu, was
                    delivered by an English midwife in a Church of England missionary hospital. But
                    that's another story.</p>
                <p>I'm trying to think about the summer of 1937. My parents were going to come visit
                    us and for some reason we had to give up the house at Coal Hill. We were able to
                    rent a house in the south Compound of the PUMC from a doctor and his wife who
                    were going on home leave. This was in June. Dick Service was now well so he and
                    his mother moved, I think, to Peitaiho, a summer resort on the Gulf of Chihli,
                    north of Tientsin.</p>
                <p>On the Fourth of July the Johnsons gave a big reception. Afterwards some of us
                    went dancing at the Peking Hotel roof garden. And then, as it was very hot, Jack
                    and some others went swimming in the San Kuan Miao swimming pool. Jack had a
                    slight sore throat but neither of us though anything of it. Elsie Lyon had taken
                    a house at Chinwangtao for the summer, as she had the year before, when Mariann
                    Clubb and I had gone to visit her. Elsie and Mariann and I became close friends
                    in Peking. This year I was going to take Ginny with me and I planned to meet my
                    parents who were coming to China on an army transport which would dock at
                    Chinwangtao. My father had just retired.</p>
                <p>On the 5th Jack really felt terrible and I called the Marine doctor to come see
                    him. The doctor said that Jack did have a very bad sore throat but he did not
                    think it serious enough for me to cancel my plans. So on the morning of the 6th
                    Ginny and I took the train for Chinwangtao, leaving the baby, Bob, in the care
                    of the amah, and Jack in bed feeling rotten. That night the Japanese attacked
                    some Chinese troops at the Marco Polo Bridge near Peking, and the Sino-Japanese
                    war had begun. Later I had a telegram from Mariann Clubb saying that Jack had
                    scarlet fever and had been taken to the PUMC Hospital. There was nothing I could
                    do. The trains had stopped running so of course I could not get back to Peking.
                    I was sure that the baby would be all right, and I couldn't do anything for
                    Jack. And my parents were arriving in a few days.</p>
                <p>My parents arrived and by this time the trains had begun to run again. The best
                    thing to do was to return to Peking on the first available train. In fact I
                    think that we got a train the afternoon that mother and father arrived. At this
                    point Elsie decided that she would go back to Peking too, to see Cecil. She
                    would leave Alice and Lilla in Chinwangtao as she would be returning there in a
                    few days.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>That day we got as far as Tientsin. Passenger trains had to give way to troop
                    trains — I suppose carrying Japanese troops. We managed to find a hotel where we
                    could spend the night, and the next day Elsie, my parents, Ginny and I got to
                    Peking. Cecil Lyon knew that I was arriving with my parents and he met us at the
                    Water Gate station. When he saw Elsie he nearly had a fit. He said, “Elsie, what
                    are you doing here?” She said, “I've come to see you!” And he said, “You've got
                    to go right back to the children, nobody knows what's going to happen and you
                    better” — and so on. So the next day Elsie returned to Chinwangtao, gathered up
                    her children, and went to Japan where she stayed with her parents, Ambassador
                    and Mrs. Grew.</p>
                <p>Jack was recovering. This was the first year, I think, that antibiotics were
                    being used for various diseases, so Jack's scarlet fever was quickly controlled
                    and he suffered no long-lasting effects.</p>
                <p>We could hear the fighting going on outside Peking. Rather, we could hear guns
                    and cannon being fired. And after a few days, those of us who lived outside the
                    Legation Quarter were told we would have to move into the Quarter. Shades of the
                    Boxer Rebellion!</p>
                <p>My mother, father, the children and I were billeted in the Lyons' house, where
                    Jack and I had lived when we first were in Peking. I knew all the servants and
                    Cecil was a wonderful host. Jack did not come with us. He had to recuperate at
                    home.</p>
                <p>As I recall it, we mostly just continued the usual life. We saw our friends, also
                    in the Legation Quarter, had tea with each other and so on. I don't think that
                    any of us had a feeling of danger. I don't know why. And after a few days we all
                    moved back to our own houses.</p>
                <p>The Japanese had taken over Peking. There was no fighting inside the city. The
                    Chinese could not protect it, and so their troops just “drifted” away. The
                    Japanese rode great big horses; that is, the officers did. Troops were stationed
                    here and there, and we foreigners were rather circumspect in public. We didn't
                    want any “incidents.” There was a kind of eeriness about it. Many of the troops
                    were quartered in the grounds of the Temple of Heaven. Have you been to
                    Peking?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I haven't.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Well, the Temple of Heaven is situated in a huge big park in what used
                    to be called the Chinese City, south of the Tarter City, which to us was the
                    main part of Peking. My father wanted very much to see the Temple of Heaven.
                    Colonel, later General, Stilwell was the military attache. Father went around to
                    his office to see if he could help with this. And Colonel Stilwell was able to
                    get a pass, or a request, which would allow Colonel Schulz and his wife to go
                    see the Temple of Heaven. I went along and we showed our passes or our papers to
                    the Japanese armed guards. They looked at the passes and after awhile, sure
                    enough, they let us into the large park. We were able to walk slowly and to take
                    our time seeing the temple. I think that a guard must have accompanied us. After
                    about an hour we left. My father was very pleased to be able to do this. I don't
                    recall how much other sight-seeing we did, but I do know that my mother went
                    shopping, and she was able to get a number of things — some chairs in particular
                    — which she actually was able to get shipped home.</p>
                <p>I did not have any feeling that I would soon be leaving Peking. Then in
                    mid-August there was a terrible bombing episode in Shanghai. By this time the
                    Japanese had taken Shanghai, or were in the process of taking it, and some of
                    their warships were anchored in the Whangpoo River, just off the Shanghai Bund.
                    The Chinese sent planes on a bombing mission against these ships. But the bombs
                    fell short and landed on the Bund instead. Especially hard hit was the Palace
                    Hotel. This was when Bob Reischauer was mortally wounded. His brother, Ed, many
                    years later became Ambassador to Japan. Ed was our classmate at Oberlin, and Bob
                    had graduated from Oberlin just a few years before us.</p>
                <p>The war was beginning to spread to other parts of China. By early September we
                    were beginning to think that the Embassy families might have to leave Peking. I
                    could hardly believe this because everything around Peking seemed relatively
                    quiet. We were all living much as we had been, giving small dinner parties and
                    so on. Of course the Japanese were in Peking, but we didn't bother them and they
                    didn't bother us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just thinking this was four years before Pearl
                        Harbor because this was 1937.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there was really no feeling of hostility
                        between...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Well, I don't know how the Japanese felt. They never smiled at us, but
                    then people always say that nobody smiles at them. There were Japanese guards
                    all around, but foreigners didn't seem to be threatened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came and went and lived as you usually did.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>SERVICE: But finally we were told that the women and children would have to leave
                    Peking. We left on the 18th of September on a special train. Mostly Americans I
                    think, but I'm not sure about this. Jane Johnson had already gone ahead to Japan
                    with her children to set a good example for us. Mrs. Lockhart, Mrs. Salisbury,
                    and Billie Millet and her two boys were on the train with us. These people I
                    remember particularly because we all went by ship to Japan and spent some time
                    in Kyoto and later in Tokyo. Later we were given the choice of staying in Japan
                    or going home to America. As I hadn't been home for four years, and had my
                    parents with me, I felt that if I were going to travel with my two small
                    children that I'd better go home with my parents and spend some time with them.
                    I wonder what they thought about this arrangement? But at that time I didn't
                    think of this. Mrs. Lockhart went home, and Ruth Smith went home with her two
                    daughters. Ruth had been in Tsinan where Horace was consul. The wives who did
                    not go home were soon allowed to return to China. So it would have been better
                    if Mrs. Lockhart, Ruth Smith, and I had not gone home. Jack was transferred to
                    Shanghai in January '38. But the State Department would not let those of us who
                    had gone home return to China right away.</p>
                <p>Finally in April of '38, the State Department said we could go back to China. I
                    rushed around and got my passport fixed up and so on. Mrs. Lockhart and Ruth
                    Smith and her two daughters were on the same ship, one of the Dollar Line. We
                    were all going to Shanghai and we were very happy. Everyone else had been back
                    in China for months.</p>
                <p>And we were to live in Shanghai from May, 1938 until November, 1940: two and a
                    half years. Then the children and I had to go home again because by this time
                    there was a feeling in the air that there was going to be terrible trouble with
                    the Japanese.</p>
                <p>So I left China in November 1940 with my two children, Virginia and Robert —
                    Robert, by the way is in the Foreign Service — and came home. And I never got
                    back to China until 1971 when Jack and I went to China as guests of the Chinese
                    government in September, 1971. We went back to Peking and we stayed in the
                    Peking Hotel where Jack and I had gone dancing so many years ago. I felt as
                    though I were in a dream. In 1971 the Legation Quarter looked much as it had so
                    many years ago, except that there were no foreigners around. San Kuan Miao was
                    still there. Now it has been replaced by new buildings. The American Embassy
                    compound is now an official guest house. Sixteen years ago, in 1971, Peking did
                    not look too different from the way I remembered it, except that the great city
                    walls around the Tartar City were gone, but not those around the Forbidden City.
                    But there were two of me walking around the streets of Peking — my 1937 self,
                    and my 1971 self.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know Chinese too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, I've only been in one country where I couldn't
                        read the street signs — Russia. How do you manage day-to-day?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Because when we lived in Peking the main street signs were in English
                    too. Morrison Street, the main shopping street, was named for an early
                    missionary and Chinese scholar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had no problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: In the Legation Quarter there was no problem. And of course, don't
                    forget, I had a husband who not only spoke Chinese but who learned to read it.
                    I'm a very poor linguist, but I did learn enough to get around. Even when I go
                    to China today I can go shopping by myself, I can get around by bus. And you can
                    always point and make gestures. I'm not really timid about such things. And
                    often Chinese will know a little English, a few words. I've found people want to
                    be helpful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in the days before language lessons at FSI so did
                        you have a tutor or did you just pick it up as you went along?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Just picked it up. I tried to learn some Chinese in Yunnanfu — I don't
                    know if I'm talking too long or too much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. Oh, no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Because I'd like to go back to Kunming. In the spring of 1935 — no, I'll
                    go back to 1933 and our second wedding. After our marriage in Haiphong, and the
                    long train ride to Yunnanfu, we were married, again, by a young Presbyterian
                    missionary minister: Arthur Romig. He told us it was his first wedding, so we
                    were one up on him! This wedding was under American auspices and the
                    vice-consul, Charles Shadrach Reed II, was the consular witness. We were living
                    in China under the unusual doctrine of extraterritoriality! Goodness, what a
                    word. We were not subject to Chinese laws or jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>But now, on to the spring of 1935. We began to hear many rumors brought in from
                    Chinese around the countryside and from missionaries who lived away from
                    Kunming, that the communists had started their “long march.” It wasn't called
                    that until much later, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't know it was going to be a long march?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>SERVICE:I'm not sure. They were coming around and through the mountainous
                    countryside of southern China trying to escape the encirclement of Chiang
                    Kai-shek's troops. People were afraid of them because they didn't know what to
                    expect. We were told that if they came towards Yunnanfu that the women and
                    children, the foreign ones, would have to leave. I was always leaving, having to
                    leave, wherever we lived in China.</p>
                <p>In mid-April we were told that the communists were approaching Kunming. I was
                    expecting my first baby in mid-July so I had to think of taking my collected
                    baby things with me — just in case I couldn't get back to Kunming. Jack's mother
                    and my mother had sent baby clothes, and we had ordered some things from
                    Montgomery Ward. So I packed a trunk with baby things and with my own
                    clothes.</p>
                <p>Then on the 29th of April we were told that the communists weren't coming towards
                    Kunming! They wanted to cross the southern-most loop of the Yangtze and would
                    bypass Kunming. We lived in the English Mission Compound at this time, which had
                    a lovely garden. As the day was beautiful I decided to spend it sitting and
                    reading in the garden. The unpacking could wait until the next day.</p>
                <p>Cy Carney, the British vice-consul, came to dinner that evening, and for some
                    reason he decided to spend the night with us. I don't know why. Maybe there was
                    a feeling of unease around the city. About one a.m. on the 30th there was a
                    great pounding on the compound gate and the gateman shouted up to Jack that
                    there was a messenger from the Consulate. Arthur Ringwalt, then the American
                    vice-consul, lived at the north end of the city. We were at the south end. Jack
                    went down to the gate and in a few minutes came back and told me that the
                    communists were approaching the city, that all the women and children would have
                    to leave on the morning train at 7 o'clock. The French were taking care of these
                    arrangements. Jack roused Carney — well he must have been wakened by all the
                    pounding and noise and shouting — and the two of them dressed quickly and went
                    off into the city. Jack was to notify the Americans, and Carney, after going to
                    the British consulate, went off to notify British nationals. I got dressed and
                    did a little more packing. Thank heaven I had not unpacked the day before. The
                    servants were all up and the cook was getting together food for the trip. I
                    don't think that I appreciated, at least not at that time, all the devoted
                    service our Chinese servants gave to us.</p>
                <p>At seven in the morning we were gathered at the station. It was pouring rain. I
                    don't know how many women and children there were. I just know that we all got
                    onto the train, got seats, and settled ourselves for a long day's journey. As
                    the train pulled out we waved through the streaming windows at the men we were
                    leaving behind.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>There was one very pregnant missionary woman on the train. One of the English
                    midwives was traveling with her in case her baby should be born before she got
                    to Hong Kong, her destination. And there was at least one man traveling with us:
                    a famous American naturalist, Dr. Joseph Rock. He worked for the National
                    Geographic and for the Smithsonian, too, I think, collecting specimens of
                    plants, especially azaleas and rhododendrons. Many of the species of these
                    plants that we have in this country today were first introduced by Joseph Rock.
                    He also had spectacular photographs of parts of China very few foreigners ever
                    got to, such as the upper gorges of the Yangtze. Dr. Rock wanted to get valuable
                    papers, pictures, and so on out of Kunming, which is why he was on this
                    train.</p>
                <p>The trip to Haiphong took the usual three days and two nights. Where all of us
                    slept those two nights I do not remember. Some people must have stayed on the
                    train because there weren't that many train-hotel accommodations. I remember
                    that I had a bed, perhaps because I was pregnant.</p>
                <p>I spent two weeks in Haiphong and then somehow or other I got word from Jack that
                    I could return to Yunnanfu! The communists did not take the city and they were
                    moving towards the Yangtze crossing. So back we went to Kunming. The men who had
                    stayed behind spent a lot of their time at the little French Club playing bridge
                    when they weren't in their offices or out trying to get information. This was
                    our first encounter, you might say, or rather non-encounter with the people who
                    were going to rule China some day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're you frightened during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: No, we weren't frightened. Do you think it was because we were stupid or
                    because we thought foreigners were always to be protected?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I certainly don't think it was stupidity by any means. I
                        think it was just — correct me if I'm wrong — I think it was the attitude of
                        the times. We felt we were perhaps not — inviolable is maybe too strong a
                        word. But it just never occurred to us.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I think we did feel we were special people. I've been frightened in my
                    life, but never when we lived abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it because you were a diplomat or because you were
                        American?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: No, because we were foreigners.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you were foreigners.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Actually the British probably had the best claim to being special people
                    because they had been out in the Far East so much longer than we had been. And
                    so many things we did were the way the British did them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, and what was your relationship with the Chinese? Did
                        you entertain them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: My dear, we didn't know any Chinese socially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't know any Chinese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: The only Chinese we came in contact with were the people in the office.
                    Now I am talking about Kunming, especially; Kunming was a two-man office, a
                    vice-consul, first Charles Shadrach Reed II, and then Arthur Ringwalt, and Jack
                    who was the clerk. I think that the second year we were in Kunming he was called
                    a vice-consul, non-career. Jack tells me that there were two Chinese in the
                    office, an interpreter and a typist, as well as a sort of office boy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have a question. For years and years we've been debating
                        the value of representational entertaining. If you didn't see and know
                        Chinese socially then the men got all of their information about the local
                        conditions from whom, from where?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Well, obviously, they did get some information from the Chinese in the
                    office. Also in Yunnanfu there was a French Consul General and there was a
                    British Consul General. The French were the people who probably had the best
                    sources because Yunnan was a French sphere of influence. The railroad was run by
                    the French. The three consulates exchanged whatever necessary information they
                    got. The Customs Commissioner was American. This, you see, is what people
                    forget. There were foreigners running important Chinese government offices. The
                    Customs Commissioner was an American, the Postal Commissioner was a Frenchman,
                    and the man who was the head of the Salt Gabelle — which means salt tax — was a
                    Corsican, also French. They got a lot of information from the Chinese who worked
                    for them and they exchanged information. Smuggling was a big thing in Kunming in
                    those days. And I think it was the main source of revenue for the local warlord,
                    Lung Yun. In the spring the fields outside the city were waving fields of opium
                    poppies, beautiful to see. The poppies were mostly white, but there were some
                    pink and some lavender. I don't recall any red ones. This was a marvelous color
                    display outside the city and in a few empty lots inside the city. It was
                    estimated by foreigners that about 50% of the population of Yunnanfu smoked
                    opium when they could. Our Number One Boy smoked opium. I think that the cook
                    did too. And poor people used it for medicine. Opium was cheaper than tobacco,
                    and certainly cheaper than medicine. A little opium smoke blown into the face of
                    a sick or crying baby would pacify it.</p>
                <p>Kunming was a poor, backward, medieval city in the days when we lived there. I've
                    said that when I went back to Peking in '71 much of it still looked the same to
                    me. Shanghai looked very much the same because it is a big foreign city and the
                    buildings are still there. Of all the places I knew before in China, Yunnanfu,
                    now Kunming, has changed the most. It's quite a pretty city now, and of course,
                    the surroundings have always been beautiful. There is a large lake on the
                    adjacent plain, and then hills, low mountains really, are around the plain.</p>
                <p>There were just two cars. One belonged to the Governor of the province, Lung Yun,
                    and the other belonged to the French Consul General. But as there were no usable
                    roads the cars couldn't go anywhere, and inside the city the streets were mostly
                    too narrow for cars. We didn't even know there was such a place as the Stone
                    Forest where all the tourists now go. If you wanted to go to Dali, which was
                    about 200 miles away, you had to go by pack horse or sedan chair. Some
                    missionaries lived in remote places, and information would trickle through to
                    Kunming from them. But you could not travel except under ancient conditions.
                    Kunming had an American Consulate mainly because it was too far from Canton to
                    be administered from the Consulate General there.</p>
                <p>[Jack Service comes in with some coffee.]</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Jack, how did you get information Yunnanfu if you wanted to know things
                    that were going on? How did you find out things since we didn't have any Chinese
                    social friends?</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>J.SERVICE: There were newspapers, Chinese newspapers, Chinese rumors and gossip
                    and the post office and so on got information about what [was] happening.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, well I said that. Talbott got stuff from the customs people and so
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: See, I was questioning the validity of all the
                        representational entertaining that “we” did, if you managed to get
                        information in China without it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>J SERVICE: We didn't have any representation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, in those days I suppose there was none. I'm really
                        quite fascinated about the traveling around — no automobiles, how did you
                        travel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>J SERVICE: We took the train to Indochina or we didn't travel.</p>
                <p>SERVICE: If we went on a picnic on a Sunday to a temple — there were some very
                    old and beautiful temples in the surrounding hills — we walked, or went in
                    rickshaws, or some of the men rode horses. And once in awhile I used a sedan
                    chair. This you will hardly believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, wonderful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: The Consulate had a sedan chair that was for the use of the top man. In
                    this case a vice-consul! The chair bearers were the consulate coolies who took
                    the notes or chits around when we wrote to our friends to ask them to dinner or
                    lunch and so on. We had no telephones, no plumbing, no electricity. We were
                    living in a very primitive way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you had a good time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: We had a wonderful time, but we couldn't have managed without our
                    Chinese servants. If we wanted a bath we told the bath coolie, or rather the
                    water coolie, at what time we wanted the bath and to have the water ready. He'd
                    fire up a boiler of some sort, get the water hot, and bring it to our bathroom
                    and pour it into the tub. We did have a bathtub. And the water could actually
                    run out of the tub because we lived on the second floor of the consulate during
                    the first year in Kunming, and there was a regular tub outlet with a plug. When
                    the plug was pulled out the water ran down through a hole in the floor. Where it
                    went from there I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No questions asked.</hi>

                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Dinners and luncheon parties were the usual form of entertainment. We
                    all entertained each other all the time. If Jack and Charles Reed and I were all
                    going out to the same dinner I would often use the sedan chair and Jack and
                    Charles would either walk or take rickshaws. There were two men carrying the
                    chair and a man in front carrying a lantern who would shout out, “Make Way, Make
                    Way, for the Great People!” I didn't understand this, but Jack told me what the
                    man was saying. Every so often one of the carriers would switch with the man
                    carrying the lantern. I felt as though I were in some medieval play.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you did these evacuations, if you want to call them
                        that, did a servant go with you to help with the children?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: No, except when we left Peking our number one boy did go to Tientsin
                    with us to help put us on the ship for Japan. I had my mother and father with me
                    and the two children — Bob just seven months old. Chen was marvelous. He spoke
                    English and was an enormous help. When I left Shanghai in 1940 the children and
                    I just got on the ship at Shanghai. The “Monterey”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh,yes. The Matson Line.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: And then after we left Shanghai we went to Australia because there were
                    already passengers on board who had booked for Australia. Noel Coward was one of
                    them. He was going to Australia in connection with some war work. We went first
                    to Manila where we picked up more women and children, and then we sailed down
                    through the Sulu Sea and so on to Port Moresby where we took on a pilot to guide
                    the ship along the coast of Australia inside the Great Barrier Reef. We spent
                    five days in Sydney Harbor and then came home via Wellington, Fiji, Samoa, and
                    Honolulu. A wonderful cruise.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: And everybody was saying oh, we'd be back in China in six months, or
                    we'd be back in one year, but of course we weren't. It was thirty-one years
                    before I saw China again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then you went back to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>SERVICE: No. My family lived in Berkeley. When my parents retired from the army
                    they moved here to Berkeley and I came and lived with them for five years. How
                    they stood it I will never know. We just took it for granted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had three children then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: No, two. Philip was born at the end of the war in Washington. Ginny and
                    Bob went to John Muir School in Berkeley. I don't know how I would have managed
                    without my family. Jack could send me $100 a month and I gave $50 to my parents
                    for room and board and laundry and goodness knows what — everything else, and I
                    kept $50 for whatever — clothes and miscellaneous. In those days there was no
                    allowance for separated families. But after about two years we got a family
                    allowance that came through the State Department. I felt rich because I got an
                    extra $180 a month. It was wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: $180 a month extra.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. Wonderful. Jack came home twice during those years. He was
                    transferred from Shanghai to Chungking in the spring of '41, and then he came
                    home on leave in December 1942.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, by that time the war had started.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: The war had started, right. Pearl Harbor was 13 months after I left
                    Shanghai. Then Jack came home again in November of 1944 when General Stilwell
                    was recalled. And I went east then, to Washington to meet him, and I got
                    pregnant then. Philip was born the next August on the day the atom bomb fell on
                    Hiroshima.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, for Heaven sakes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: And my parents were in Washington. They had been to my father's 50th
                    West Point reunion. My father was sitting beside my bed when I came out of the
                    anesthesia. He was reading the Evening Star, which had great big headlines about
                    the atom bomb. Do you know what my thought was? I had spent nine months making
                    one human being, and here were 100,000 (the number then given) wiped out.</p>

                <p>SERVICE: It just made the most lasting impression on me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Has it made you a pacifist really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I'm not sure. I don't think of myself as a pacifist, but I think wars
                    are crazy.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I'm anti-nuclear weapons. I think that some day humans have got to
                    decide not to kill each other off. You don't want to get me started on this
                    subject because I think that what is wrong with the human race is that we want
                    to kill each other so much. Or at least people want to kill other people who
                    aren't like them. You have only to read the papers any day of the week to see
                    this. The two most divisive things in the world are religion and race. Most
                    religions preach peace and good will, and yet people continue to kill each other
                    in the name of religion. Well, that's a subject that is very close to my
                    heart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it a very profound reaction to the bomb that was
                        dropped on Hiroshima.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: August 6, 1945, was quite a day in our lives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Now, I don't know whether you want this. Jack also went to the Grand
                    Jury that day in connection with the Amerasia Case in the summer of '45. And he
                    got a completely clean bill of health, 20 to 0 in Jack's favor. He knew that
                    Philip was born and then he went to the Grand Jury.</p>
                <p>Also the man who was in charge of the Manhattan Project was Major General, later
                    Lt. General, Leslie Richard Groves. I had known Dick Groves since I was thirteen
                    years old when he was a 1st Lt. in the Third Engineer Regiment commanded at that
                    time by my father. And I thought — how could Dick Groves do this to me? Of
                    course he didn't do it to me. But he was somebody I knew well — I had done
                    babysitting for the Groves' baby at Schofield Barracks — and he was connected
                    with the bomb. It was a very personal reaction.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>When Philip was six weeks old Jack left for Japan. He and John Emmerson and Max
                    Bishop were to be assistants to George Atcheson who was to be the political
                    adviser to Gen. MacArthur. The war with Japan had ended a few days after the
                    bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki — at the end of that week, I think.
                    I know that I was still in the hospital. John Emmerson and Max Bishop were the
                    Japan men on George Atcheson's staff and Jack was the China man.</p>
                <p>Also, I think, Jack was sent to Japan to get him away from Washington and out of
                    the public eye after the events of that summer. So once again we were separated.
                    I stayed in Chevy Chase with the three children. We had rented a house between
                    Connecticut and Wisconsin Avenues. Ginny and Bob went to Rosemary grade
                    school.</p>
                <p>This is when Dorothy Emmerson and I became such close friends. We had met during
                    the summer, but it was not until our husbands went off to Japan that our
                    friendship grew and flourished, at first, largely by phone. Philip was a colicky
                    baby and so I was often up with him at night. Somehow I found out that Dorothy
                    often ironed late at night. So sometimes she and I would talk on the phone — she
                    ironing with one hand, and I stuffing a bottle of milk into Philip's mouth with
                    one hand. Dorothy and I still do a lot of phone talking, she from Los Altos
                    Hills, and I from Berkeley-Oakland.</p>
                <p>Just before Thanksgiving General [Patrick Jay] Hurley resigned from being
                    Ambassador to China with a great blast at the China Hands who, he said, had
                    sabotaged his mission to China. He picked especially on Jack and George Atcheson
                    although neither of them had had anything to do with China for many months.
                    Hurley returned home and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held hearings.
                    The sort of thing you see on TV today. Then there wasn't any TV.</p>
                <p>I first learned of Hurley's blast from a telephone call and then from the radio
                    and the papers. And I expected and hoped that Jack would be called home, but he
                    was not.</p>
                <p>When the hearing started I went to as many of the sessions as I could, but it
                    always meant getting a kind friend to take care of Philip for several hours.
                    Dorothy Emmerson, my sister-in-law, Helen Service, Peggy Reid, and others helped
                    me out. Hurley's charges were refuted. I believe that Secretary of State Byrnes
                    testified.</p>
                <p>After the hearings were over, I phoned the company that had the stenographic
                    contract for the committee — how I found out the name I have no idea — and asked
                    if I could buy a copy of the transcript. The company insisted on giving me a
                    copy — would not let me pay for it. This was a very thoughtful and unexpected
                    kindness. And then I was able to send the transcript to Tokyo with Jack (George)
                    Kerr. I met him at dinner at Dorothy Emmerson's and he offered his services as
                    he was going to Tokyo. Years later, in Berkeley, we became great friends.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>When Jack went to Japan we had no car. With a new baby it was very difficult to
                    shop, to go anywhere or to take the children anywhere. Peggy Reid, the wife of
                    one of our wonderful Oberlin friends, John Reid, said that one of their
                    neighbors had a 12-year old Cadillac coupe that he would sell for $200! I bought
                    it and it made all the difference in my Washington life. Ginny and Bob and I all
                    fitted easily into the broad seat — no bucket seats in those days — and Philip
                    could be put on the wide shelf behind the seat. It was perfect.</p>
                <p>The older children were so helpful with Philip. They could baby-sit with him
                    except at night when I could get a regular baby-sitter if I went out. When I
                    left Washington in April, '46, to go to Japan, I thought, I sold that marvelous
                    Cadillac — the only one we've ever owned — for $200, just what I paid for it. So
                    my winter's transportation cost me just the gas — I got about 7 or 8 miles to
                    the gallon — and the insurance.</p>
                <p>Either before I left Washington, or shortly after the children and I arrived in
                    Berkeley, word came from Jack that he was in an army hospital in Tokyo.
                    Infectious hepatitis. Jack spent four months in the hospital, so my parents had
                    the children and me back again while the Department decided what to do next with
                    Jack. Our household belongings spent those months on a dock or in a warehouse in
                    New York. I don't know where.</p>
                <p>Sometime during the summer, Jack was transferred from Tokyo to Wellington where
                    he would be First Secretary, which at that time was the number two man in the
                    Legation there. Jack's orders were for him to come to this country for a short
                    leave, pick up the children and me, and sail for New Zealand. Jack came home on
                    a refrigerator ship. We made a quick trip to Claremont to see his mother, and
                    then we sailed from San Francisco about the first of October on the “Monterey” —
                    the same ship that had brought the children and me home from Shanghai in 1940!
                    It had been a troop ship during the intervening years and was still fitted out
                    as a troop ship. All five of us were in one cabin with six bunks in two tiers.
                    Four of us took four bunks, the upper two in each tier being used for the excess
                    baggage. Philip slept in a Playpen on the floor. It was a fine trip, a second
                    south sea island “cruise.”</p>
                <p>When we were first in Wellington, Avra Warren was the Minister. Later Robert M.
                    Scotten came and Wellington was raised to an Embassy. Between Mr. Warren's
                    departure and Mr. Scotten's arrival Jack was Charg� for about seven months which
                    was very nice for us. Also Jack was promoted to Class II and we thought all our
                    troubles were behind us. Jack had gotten a double promotion from class 6 to
                    class 4 in May, 1945, before the Amerasia Case broke. Then there was a
                    restructuring of the Foreign Service grades when we were in Wellington, and Jack
                    was put into class 3. Wellington was the calm before the storm which, of course,
                    we did not know was coming.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>For me it was the best post of our career. The war was over and after years of
                    separation our family was together again. Our friends of those years, both
                    Americans and New Zealanders, have remained our friends through all these years.
                    The Diplomatic Corps was close-knit and friendly. We had a wonderful time. And
                    this is where we first knew Lisa and Marshall Green. After the Greens left New
                    Zealand Lisa and I began our “life-long” correspondence which is still going on
                    today.</p>
                <p>Two New Zealand couples who became close friends, George and Pat Laking, and
                    Frank and Lyn Corner, later became ambassadors — the men — to Washington. And in
                    our office there were the Beverstocks, the Watsons, the Seiberts, the Armie
                    Lees, the Reddens, the Abbotts, the Fosters, the Daggetts, Anne Taylor who was
                    Warrens secretary, and of course both the Scottens and the Warrens. Neither of
                    the Warrens lived very long, but I saw Mary Warren and Anne Taylor when I lived
                    in New Delhi. And Ann Scotten and we have been close friends through the
                    years.</p>
                <p>Wellington was a very happy place for Ginny and Bob. Ginny went to a private
                    school for girls, and Bob went to one of the state schools. And he got a job
                    delivering newspapers with one of the New Zealand boys who was in his class.</p>
                <p>The mainstay of our lives was Ann Gane, now Ann Marsh, who came to live with us
                    to be our housekeeper-cook. Mrs. Adams, the cateress, without whom none of us
                    could have given a big party, brought Ann to us. Ann had a daughter, Louise, who
                    was just a year older than Philip, and the two of them were like a brother and
                    sister. When Philip was 1-1/2 and Louise 2-1/2 I began taking them to a day
                    nursery between the hours of 9 or 10 and 4. It was a perfect arrangement for
                    both Ann and me. Of the children only Ginny came home to lunch each day. She and
                    Ann became great friends.</p>
                <p>Ann was just ten years younger than I so she was 26 when she came to us. Neither
                    of us knew much about cooking so we pored over Fannie Farmer together and Ann
                    became a first-rate cook. Later she worked for the Eltings, the Sidney Brownes,
                    and the Haseltons. After that Ann came to this country, married an American, and
                    had two sons. She and the grown sons live in New Zealand. Louise and her family
                    live in this country. And Ann is still very close to us.</p>
                <p>And I want especially to mention Gwynneth Hall, who was on the New Zealand staff
                    of the Embassy. She was a great help with the political reporting as both
                    Marshall Green and Armie Lee can testify to. Gwen Hall and Ann Gane have both
                    visited us in Berkeley, as have other New Zealand friends. I often think how
                    lucky we were to be sent to that friendly and beautiful country.</p>
                <p>We left Wellington at the end of 1948, the children and I by ship and Jack by
                    plane to Washington. He was assigned to one of the Foreign Service Promotion
                    Boards, and after that to the Division of Foreign Service Personnel.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>On October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the People's Republic of China from
                    Tiananmen — the Gate of Heavenly Peace — in Peking. And the “Who Lost China?”
                    frenzy began. China was never ours to lose.</p>
                <p>In February 1950, Jack and the children and I left Washington for India. Jack was
                    to be Consul General in Calcutta. En route we visited my family in Berkeley, and
                    Jack made a quick side trip to see his mother in Claremont.</p>
                <p>It was while we were in Berkeley with my parents that McCarthy gave his famous —
                    maybe I should say infamous — speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, about
                    card-carrying communists in the State Department. When I think of McCarthy the
                    one word to describe him that comes to my mind is “Yahoo.” McCarthy had a list
                    of over 100 names, so he said, of people in the State Department who were
                    “communists,” or “card-carrying communists.” He gave no names, but each
                    description of a “subversive person” had a number and a description. None of the
                    descriptions fitted Jack.</p>
                <p>Jack phoned the State Department to ask what we should do. Should he come back to
                    Washington? We were booked on a freighter out of Seattle bound for Madras on
                    March 11. The Department said that Jack was not on McCarthy's list and that we
                    should continue to India, which we did.</p>
                <p>On March 11 we sailed for a month long trip to India via Japan and the
                    Philippines. The passage across the north Pacific at that time of year was
                    stormy. I had developed an abscessed tooth in Seattle, just before we sailed. We
                    were staying with my oldest sister and all I had time to do was go to her
                    dentist long enough to get a penicillin shot. The dentist gave me some
                    penicillin ampules for injections that I was to administer myself for several
                    days. I got rid of the abscess pains in my jaw, but came out in terrible
                    hives.</p>
                <p>About halfway across the ocean the radio operator came to our cabin one evening
                    and said to Jack that the news was talking about a man named Service that
                    McCarthy was after. McCarthy was saying that Service had “lost China” and so
                    on.</p>
                <p>So Jack rushed up to the radio room to listen and heard a lot more. The radio man
                    had a friend in Los Angeles who was a ham operator, and our radio man was able
                    to get more information from him about what was going on in Washington.</p>
                <p>The next day a cable came to the ship from the State Department telling Jack to
                    return to Washington from Japan. We were given the option of my staying in Japan
                    with the children, returning to Washington with Jack, or going on to India.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Jack and I decided that the sensible thing to do was for me to go on to India and
                    get the children into school again. Also we thought that after a quick trip home
                    to clear things up that Jack would fly out to New Delhi. He might even get there
                    before the children and I would. In this same cable Jack's orders were changed
                    from Calcutta to New Delhi where he would be political counselor in the
                    Embassy.</p>
                <p>The Tokyo Embassy sent people to meet us at Yokohama and Jack flew home that same
                    evening. The children and I were put up in the Imperial Hotel while our ship was
                    in port. And then on we sailed to Manila where we saw Ed and Mary Rice, to Cebu
                    and Ilo Ilo, to Singapore, and finally to Madras where the Consul General and
                    his wife met us.</p>
                <p>After about three days in a hotel in Madras, we and our bags and trunks were put
                    on an Air India flight for New Delhi. Jean Steeves met us at the airport. This
                    was April 15, 1950. The next morning Hazel and Henri Sokolove came to take the
                    children and me sightseeing around New Delhi. This was the beginning of our New
                    Delhi year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think the fact that — if I could back up just a moment
                        so that anyone listening to this will know what we're talking about. You
                        arrived in New Delhi thinking your husband would be along momentarily.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had no home to go back to in Washington, you had three
                        children with you, you had been transfered, while you were en route, from
                        Calcutta to New Delhi.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was your furniture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I don't know where my furniture was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was probably the least of your worries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I didn't know where the furniture was or where the car was or anything.
                    But I got to New Delhi — flew from Madras where the ship docked — and everyone
                    was absolutely marvelous to me. Loy Henderson was the ambassador. I spent a
                    whole year less two weeks in New Delhi. Jack never got there.</p>

                <p>SERVICE: I could never have managed so well if Loy Henderson had not been so
                    supportive. Peggy Parsons and Jeff Parsons were there. Jack was to take Jeff's
                    place as Political Counselor. The Parsons were being transferred. Later he was
                    Ambassador to Sweden. I was going to move into their house when they left. But
                    in the meantime I was just put into another house next to John and Jean Steeves,
                    who were wonderful to me.</p>
                <p>Then Peggy, Peggy was simply marvelous. She said she'd take Ginny and Bob to
                    Mussoorie to Woodstock School because she was going up to see her two daughters.
                    And Philip was very sick with a sort of dysentery, and I just didn't want to
                    leave him. An Indian doctor came to the house to treat him. Philip was not quite
                    five years old.</p>
                <p>When the Parsons left I moved into their house, which was partly furnished with
                    government furniture. And then our furniture turned up from somewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Calcutta.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: And the car appeared. The car was “special delivery,” almost. It was put
                    on a fast train by the Indians and up it came. The Embassy was as amazed as I
                    was because they had not asked for any special treatment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just wanted to ask you. You know today we really do have
                        what I fear must be called a cumbersome administrative section abroad. I
                        think 30% of the people who are abroad are administrators who do housing,
                        transportation, and so on. It sounds as if you were taken care of simply by
                        the goodwill of your colleagues.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Absolutely. They were wonderful to me. There was an administrative
                    officer, of course, and he was extremely helpful when I had a problem, as was
                    the head Indian employee in that department. But everyone I came in contact with
                    was helpful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That says something for the service in those days, doesn't
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. It was most supportive.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Mrs. Henderson was often away — in Kashmir or other places. So when Loy Henderson
                    had a luncheon he would often call up one of the wives — his secretary would
                    call — to act as his hostess at the luncheon. I was included in this list. It
                    was a very kind thing for him to do as I didn't have any official standing at
                    all.</p>
                <p>I was soon invited to many Indian affairs because they saw that I was included in
                    American functions, and so I was soon put on the diplomatic list and I was
                    invited to many of the big events, nothing small, but when everyone was invited
                    I was included.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you expected Jack to follow you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Because I expected Jack.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he never came.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Right, but he never got there. Everyone was more than helpful. Finally I
                    decided that I was going to give a big party because I thought that Jack would
                    get to Delhi by Christmas. He went through several more hearings in Washington
                    and was always cleared. But that didn't make any difference. I think that by
                    this time McCarthyism had become so all-pervasive that someone had to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did they single him out of all the others? Because he
                        was outspoken and stood by his...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: No. Well because he had had a lot to do with the so-called “loss of
                    China,” in quotes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we know that's nonsense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: And the Amerasia thing was always in a way haunting him. But even
                    without that the China Hands, as they were called — Edmund Clubb, John Carter
                    Vincent, and John Davies were easy targets. John Davies was finally fired
                    out-of-hand, I think, right after the election of 1954. John Carter Vincent and
                    Edmund Clubb, being over 50, were forced into retirement. It was because of
                    China. Because China had gone communist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As if it were their fault?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. These people had “Lost China.” It was so crazy. You can just tear
                    your hair sometimes. The ironic thing is that it was Nixon who finally got John
                    Davies fired. Dulles was the Secretary of State. The Republican Administration
                    was determined to get people out of the Foreign Service who had been in the
                    China service. You can't say it was a plot; it's just thapolitically it was a
                    good drum to beat. They wanted to show the public that Republicans weren't “soft
                    on communism.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a great anti-communist moment in the
                        country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. I don't know, Jewell, but it was as though the country was facing a
                    great outside menace which was inside the country. It just drove people nuts to
                    think that China was not pro-American anymore. But we were at fault too. We
                    still say that nobody could go to China — Westerners. Actually western Europeans
                    were going to China. The British were going to China, the French, and so forth.
                    They all had embassies there. And the New Zealanders and the Australians, they
                    had diplomatic relations with China. And the Canadians. But we did not want to
                    have diplomatic relations with China except on our own terms. It was an internal
                    public relations business. It was like a red flag to a bull to mention China
                    except in pejorative terms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds as though the whole thing were political because
                        McCarthy and Nixon thought they needed it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They needed it for votes and for public support and what
                        have you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: That's exactly right. McCarthy frightened Americans. He frightened the
                    public. I was frightened. Now I'll tell you. I wasn't frightened in China. I
                    wasn't frightened the year I spent alone in India. I wasn't frightened traveling
                    around the world. But I was frightened by McCarthy. I thought what is he going
                    to do to us? What is he going to do to our children?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, we survived him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, we survived him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We really did. We all did, the country did.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>SERVICE: We did survive, but at the time you don't know. When you yourself are
                    personally involved you don't know what's going to happen to you.</p>
                <p>And then Jack was fired. In December '51. But I think I ought to finish about
                    India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, finish about India.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Oh, Philip. Philip I sent to a little nursery school run by a Norwegian
                    woman who was married to an Indian. In this little nursery school there were
                    both the little Gandhi boys, the sons of Indira Gandhi and the grandsons of
                    Prime Minister Nehru. Sanjay died tragically in an airplane accident, and Rajiv
                    is now Prime Minister of India.</p>
                <p>Rajiv had his sixth birthday while we were there. All the children in the nursery
                    school were invited to his birthday party, along with their mothers. Mrs. Gandhi
                    and her sons lived with her father, and Nehru came in and spoke with all of us —
                    spoke with all the children. After the cake and ice cream we all went out on the
                    lawn — I think not far from where Mrs. Gandhi was later assassinated — and there
                    was a snake charmer, with his cobras and his “flute,” to entertain the children.
                    The mothers too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How wonderful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: All these children, Indians and different foreigners, not just Americans
                    by any means, were all sitting there in a circle watching the snake charmer.
                    That was one of the things that made India a very unusual place. I liked India
                    and I liked the Indians. I had a wonderful Indian neighbor family. Just a few
                    days ago I had a letter from the wife, now a widow. Her friendship is still very
                    important to me. And the history of India is fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year are we now, around 1950?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: The year I spent in India was from April '50 to the end of March '51.
                    Finally the State Department decided, knew, that Jack would not be getting to
                    India. Hearings were still going on, and on. So it was decided to bring me home.
                    Obviously I couldn't stay in Delhi “forever.”</p>
                <p>I want to add a few words here about my New Delhi Year.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>I've mentioned the faithful and unstinted service that our Chinese servants gave
                    us. My Indian servants were equally helpful and considerate. All of them had
                    worked for Peggy and Jeff Parsons and knew how to run a house. They must have
                    wondered many times if the “memsahib's” husband would ever come, when their life
                    as well as mine would return to normal.</p>
                <p>The cook and the two bearers — John, Daniel, and Lawrence — were Christians. Then
                    there were the sweeper, the gardener, and the gatekeeper. These men were Hindus.
                    As far as I knew all of their families lived in the Servants' quarters at the
                    far end of the garden. Sometimes those children and Philip would play together.
                    Five mornings a week the number 2 bearer, Lawrence, would bicycle Philip to
                    kindergarten and then fetch him home at noon.</p>
                <p>If I went on a short trip, say to Agra, John and Lawrence took care of Philip.
                    When I went to Mussoorie I usually took Philip with me. But if I left Philip at
                    home I had absolute faith in their honesty and faithful care.</p>
                <p>Because Jack and I were separated by circumstances over which we had no control,
                    we received a separation allowance. I had no bank account in New Delhi. I
                    suppose I could say that the Embassy was my bank. Every month I cashed a check
                    for $400 which carried me through each month and paid for Ginny and Bob in
                    Woodstock School. In 1950 there was no school allowance for children abroad.</p>
                <p>So in April of '51, March 30 to be exact, I left New Delhi with Philip, but I
                    left Ginny and Bob in Woodstock School in Mussoorie until the term ended in
                    July. I could not have done that if the Embassy had not been wonderful. They
                    said that when the term was over they would bring the children down to New
                    Delhi, and then send them by train to Bombay to catch a ship for home. And they
                    would send a bearer on the train with them. The Consul General in Bombay at that
                    time was Prescott Childs. He and his wife, Roberta, were good friends to us.
                    Jack had replaced Prescott in Wellington. They took Ginny and Bob into their
                    home and then put them on the ship for New York. Our dear New Zealand friends,
                    Pat and George Laking loaned us their house. He became Ambassador to Washington
                    later on and now he is Sir George Laking and she is Lady Laking. We have many
                    dear New Zealand friends. In fact without friends I do not know how we would
                    have managed. And our families too. And that year when Jack was alone in
                    Washington two especially dear Foreign Service couples came to our help. Jack
                    lived with Tony and Phyllis Freeman for months in their house in Georgetown. I
                    sent most of my letters to Jack in care of Lisa Green, because I knew that she
                    would find Jack wherever he was staying. Lisa went to many of the open hearings
                    when Jack was testifying and wrote me in detail about them. Lisa and Marshall
                    had been with us in New Zealand. And our sister-in-law Helen Service, Dick's
                    wife — Dick was in Moscow at this time, but Helen and the children were in
                    nearby Virginia — was always there to help Jack when she could.</p>
                <p>Jack was fired on the 14th of December, 1951. Actually it came out on the 13th
                    that he would be “terminated” the next day.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Merry Christmas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. Merry Christmas. So that was that and then what to do. You know,
                    that was it. We had no money, we had no outside resources at all. We were paid
                    back what Jack had put into the pension fund. But early in January Jack got a
                    letter from a man in New York, a Mr. Clement Wells, who had a steam trap
                    business, and he offered Jack a job. It was a miracle to receive this
                    letter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, did you stay in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: No, we moved to New York, to Kew Gardens in Queens. Actually the
                    children and I stayed in Washington until the end of summer. Mr. Wells had Jack
                    go to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania for a few weeks to work on an assembly line to see
                    how steam traps are put together. There's a steam trap on the floor there. We
                    use it as a doorstop. After Bethlehem, Jack moved to New York and went to work
                    for Mr. Wells in the export side of the business. Mr. Wells was English and had
                    come to this country long ago, and SARCO was his own company. While we were
                    still in Washington, various friends took Jack in. He lived with our dear
                    Oberlin friends, Persis and Bun Gladieux, and with some New Zealand friends,
                    Denis and Patricia Dunlop, who were with the United Nations.</p>
                <p>Then when it became time for the family to join him, Jack rented an apartment in
                    the Bronx. It was owned by the Equitable Life Insurance Co. When the company
                    found out who Jack was they returned the deposit check because they would not
                    rent to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What a dreadful time for you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: It was awful. I then knew how people felt who are dispossessed, or who
                    face discrimination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Jack was then able to rent an apartment in Kew Gardens. The SARCO office
                    was in the Empire State Building and Jack rode the subway into 34th Street. He
                    claims that in all the years he made this trip he never sat down on the subway
                    when he was going to work! He did a lot of traveling, to Mexico, to Europe, for
                    Mr. Wells, visiting companies that manufactured the SARCO steam traps under
                    license, and meeting the company managers.</p>

                <p>In the meantime, his lawyer, Ed Rhetts, had determined on the day Jack was fired
                    that he'd take Jack's case through the courts to try to win a reversal of the
                    State Department decision to fire Jack.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Was anyone else fired?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: John Davies was fired as I've mentioned before. And John Melby was
                    fired. He had been one of the group that put out the “China White Paper” in 1950
                    I believe. This was authorized by the State Department, but that didn't keep
                    John from being fired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now did they all appeal this together, or did your husband
                        do it on his own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: No, Jack alone, because later the State Department rules were changed. I
                    believe that now anyone can be fired for almost any reason the Department
                    chooses to give. Jack had been cleared and cleared, but he was the first one
                    fired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though he had been cleared?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. Jack had a legal case. And Ed Rhetts and some other lawyers who
                    helped him — Jack Burling, Joe Rauh, and a man named Gardner, I think — gave
                    help where they could. Finally the case reached the Supreme Court which accepted
                    it. With our children we went to Washington in April, 1957, to hear Ed Rhetts
                    argue the case before the Supreme Court. It was a solemn and moving
                    occasion.</p>
                <p>The decision was handed down on June 17, 1957, a Monday. The Supreme Court nearly
                    always announces it decisions on a Monday. Ginny was going to the dentist to
                    have a wisdom tooth out at two o'clock. About twenty minutes to two, just as we
                    were leaving the apartment, the phone rang and some newspapermen said, “Your
                    husband has just won his case in the Supreme Court. A unanimous decision.” I
                    said, “What!?” I screamed, you see. The man wanted to know how to get hold of
                    Jack, and I gave him the number at SARCO. And then I hung up and Ginny and I
                    just looked at each other. I guess we must have hugged each other. I phoned the
                    dentist to tell him we'd be a bit late, and then I called Jack, but I waited
                    until I thought the news people had got to him. I'm trying to think where Bob
                    was. I think he was driving west with some friends to get jobs in a packing firm
                    in the State of Washington — fruit packing, the frozen variety. And Philip came
                    home from PS 99, across the street. And I phoned my family. How I wish that
                    Jack's mother had been alive. She died in 1954. Ginny got her tooth out, and
                    Jack came home by subway — it was a very hot June night — and the phone never
                    stopped ringing all evening. Ray Ludden, an old China hand who was Consul
                    General in Dusseldorf, had heard the great news there and he phoned. The phone
                    just rang and rang and rang.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course it did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: And then people wondered if Jack would really go back to the State
                    Department. Actually the Supreme Court decision stated that Jack had never been
                    out of the Foreign Service — never had been out — never should have been
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words the Supreme Court said that his firing was
                        illegal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, Jack had already won two points in both the lower Court and Court
                    of Appeals. But the decision for his reinstatement came through the Supreme
                    Court. Jack never had any intention of doing anything other than returning to
                    the Foreign Service if he could. Not only for our good name, but because we
                    loved the Foreign Service. I loved the Foreign Service; I think it was a
                    marvelous life. And I think that, well, it was just the only thing we would ever
                    have considered doing.</p>
                <p>So we went back and were in Washington two years. Jack had to go through another
                    security clearance. And once again Jack was cleared and he was sent to
                    Liverpool, England. Which doesn't sound like the greatest post in the world, but
                    we loved Liverpool. Jack would probably not use the word “loved,” but that is
                    the way I felt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, it's a very important port.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Was. Long ago, but no longer. But in one of the parks of Liverpool, near
                    where we lived, we were walking one day and came upon a statue of Columbus. We
                    wondered, “What's Columbus doing in Liverpool?” The marker said: “Columbus, the
                    discoverer of the New World and the maker of Liverpool.” Because it was the New
                    World that made Liverpool such an important port. American cotton for the mills
                    of Lancashire came through Liverpool. And thousands upon thousands of Irish came
                    through Liverpool on their way to America in the last century. The English
                    thought of entering the Civil War, almost entered the war on the side of the
                    South, to keep the cotton coming in. But they didn't. They sensibly stayed out
                    of our war. But Liverpool had been a booming place up to the Second World War
                    when the port was badly bombed. Liverpool was a very happy post for us. Ginny
                    and Bob were grown and were no longer with us. But Philip was with us and went
                    to Liverpool College, which was a prep school. And Ginny and her husband, Garth
                    McCormick, were married in Liverpool. They came from Washington to be married in
                    Liverpool, in the Ancient Chapel of Toxteth, which dates back to 1619. Members
                    of its early congregations emigrated to America.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>And we made so many good friends in Liverpool. I never think of the English as
                    being anything but warm and friendly.</p>
                <p>Returning to the Foreign Service was worth all we'd been through. I don't want to
                    get emotional.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but it was worth it all to fight it through and come
                        back in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Oh, absolutely, and for the children too. Our son, Bob, is in the
                    Foreign Service. He and his wife, Karol, have two children, Jennifer and John.
                    Our daughter, Virginia, and her husband, Garth McCormick, have four children,
                    Jessica, Rachel, Caroline (Cailie), and John. Garth is a professor of Applied
                    Mathematics at George Washington University. They live in Chevy Chase.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She's the one I talked to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, Ginny of course, she's the one you talked to. And Philip has
                    married an angel who is one-quarter Japanese. Kiisa Nishikawa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I bet she is lovely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, she is lovely. Both she and Philip are genetic scientists. Right
                    now Kiisa has a grant at University of California, Berkeley,and Philip has an
                    NIH (National Insititue of Health) grant at University of California, Davis. A
                    long commute for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your life really has turned out very nicely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, it has. But I really can't emphasize enough how much support,
                    emotional, psychological, and in a few cases pecuniary, we had from friends and
                    family. Oberlin friends were especially helpful and supportive. Oberlin, where
                    we met, has always meant much to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it led up to the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. We wanted to get married and Jack met some old friends with whom
                    he'd grown up in West China — the Yard sisters — and they said, “Why don't you
                    take the Foreign Service exam?” John Davies had taken the exams and passed. This
                    was during the Great Depression and there weren't that many jobs about.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course. Those were in the days when I have been told,
                        young officers were told, yes, there's a job in Prague if you can get to

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: People weren't paid for home leave.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: There was a famous story, I'm not even sure it's true, but it could have
                    been, about a man in Nagasaki who had I don't know how many children. He lived
                    there for years, but he never got home leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because they couldn't afford to move him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: People didn't have home leave for years on end. There wasn't any
                    money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did you, all of the moving around, did you just not
                        have many possessions or did you just leave your household things behind and
                        have faith that eventually, as you said, eventually you would get them
                        again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: When we were first married, in Kunming we didn't have any household
                    things. We lived in one wing of the Consulate, a big old Chinese house, the
                    first year we were there with bits and pieces of government furniture. We lived
                    in a house belonging to an English missionary doctor and his wife our second
                    year. They were on home leave. And we used their furniture, and we even had a
                    flush toilet! But it flushed only after the water coolie had carried many
                    buckets of water up to the tank on the roof. No water in the tank, no flush. We
                    finally paid to have a small pump installed with a pipe leading to the tank, and
                    then all the coolie had to do several times a day was pump.</p>
                <p>When we were in Peking, and especially in Shanghai, we were able to have some
                    furniture made (by Walnut Joe in Peking), and we began to buy old pieces of
                    Chinese furniture. The Chinese dollar was declining markedly in value which made
                    it easy for Americans to buy things. And in Shanghai we were getting $3,000 a
                    year. We started out in Kunming on $1,800 which was soon reduced to about $1,500
                    because all government salaries were cut for a year or two because of the
                    Depression. When we went to Peking our salary was $2,500 a year.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>When Jack was transferred from Shanghai to Chungking the government sent all of
                    our personal possessions home. And I put them in storage in Berkeley for years
                    because I was living with my parents. When Jack came home in 1945, our effects
                    were shipped East. They were shipped to New Zealand and later to India. But not
                    to Liverpool because there we lived in a great big house owned by the American
                    government. It was a lovely, furnished house, set in a big garden.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go after Liverpool?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: After Liverpool Jack realized that there was simply no real future for
                    him in the Foreign Service. And Jack decided that if he wanted to do anything
                    else he had better retire. We were both fifty-two in 1962 when Jack really
                    retired from the Foreign Service. We came back to Berkeley, and Jack went to the
                    University of California for two years to get an MA in political science. After
                    that he was offered a job at the Center for Chinese Studies at Berkeley and so
                    was finally back in the China field after all those years. And then in 1971, and
                    this is going to be the end of my story...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...you went back.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: ...after ping pong. James Reston went to China in August, and one day in
                    early September the phone rang and a man from the New York Times said to Jack,
                    “You're going to be in James Reston's column tomorrow. You've been invited back
                    to China.” Jack said, “What?” and the man said, “Read James Reston tomorrow,”
                    which of course we did, and I said to Jack, “I hardly call this an invitation.
                    It just says that you and three others would be welcomed back to China.” The
                    others were John Fairbank, John Davies, and, I think, Owen Lattimore. And Jack
                    said, “I'm going to call up the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa.” The United States
                    didn't have diplomatic relations with China.</p>
                <p>So Jack called the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa. The Ambassador there was Huang Hua,
                    an old friend from the Chungking-Yenan days. Jack asked about the Reston column,
                    and Huang Hua said that Jack was invited back to China. “Come to Ottawa to get
                    your visa!” I said to Jack, “Look it costs a lot of money to go to Ottawa to get
                    your visa.” But Jack said that he was going. And I said, “Okay, you can get my
                    visa, too, because I'm going with you.”</p>
                <p>Jack then called the State Department to be sure it was okay with the State
                    Department if he went back to China, and they said okay. So Jack flew to Ottawa
                    to get our visas, and the next week we were off to China!</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>And that's where we started this. We went via Hong Kong, took the train to
                    Canton, and then flew to Peking. It was a dreamlike trip. And then when Nixon
                    decided to go to China, that was it. Kissinger went to China twice, I think, in
                    1971, and then President and Mrs. Nixon went in 1972. Probably no one could have
                    accomplished this opening to China except Nixon and Kissinger.</p>

                <p>SERVICE: They could not have. They would have been absolutely crucified, and I
                    think it's probably the one great thing that Nixon did in his
                    administration.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: ...and family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ... that kept you going. You went along in the role of a
                        traditional wife, whereas today the women don't do that. They want their own
                        careers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Well, Jewell, I never wanted a career. Marriage was the “role” I was
                    interested in, although I didn't think in terms of “roles.” I'm 77 now and I was
                    brought up in the period when marriage was the accepted way of life for most
                    women. And, anyway, after I started going with Jack in Oberlin, our Junior year,
                    I wanted to marry Jack more than anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Marriage was the expectation that was set for us,
                        really.</hi>

                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>SERVICE: However I did get a small job when we lived in New York. When you have
                    three children and no private means you cannot just sit down. Bob got a
                    scholarship to go to Oberlin, and Ginny got a scholarship for the first year
                    there. After that the money I earned went into her college. Both Ginny and Bob
                    got summer jobs, which helped with their college expenses. They were wonderful.
                    I never heard them complain because there had been such a radical change in
                    their lives. And, anyway, what do you do? You do what everybody else in this
                    world does mostly, which is just keep going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Keep going, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I think how do people manage who lose their jobs today? We have
                    unemployment insurance, but after that runs out what do people do? They go on
                    Welfare. But even that doesn't always work. I think it is dreadful that people
                    anywhere in the world today should starve to death.</p>
                <p>There is a statement I've heard many times in my life about poor people. That
                    they are stupid and/or they are happy! I heard this in England especially. Now I
                    love England, I'm a true Anglophile, but many of the people we knew had little
                    concern for the people on the bottom: if they were stupid you couldn't do
                    anything for them, and if they were happy, why should you do anything for them?
                    Are we getting more like this in this country? I'm afraid so. It makes me so
                    cross to hear denigrating remarks about unfortunate people. No matter how hard
                    they work, migrant workers for example, there are going to be some people who
                    are never going to be able to improve their status or their living conditions.
                    This is true of the majority of the people in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the world, definitely in the Third World. How would we
                        feel if we knew jobs were out there, but we were unqualified and there was
                        no way we could get one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I'm always surprised at heartlessness. But perhaps it is not
                    heartlessness so much as just the difficulty of identifying with people who are
                    not well off. You've lived in the Third World a lot, haven't you?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A lot. Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: More than we have.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Yes, practically all Third World countries except for
                        Holland, and you can't say that Curacao and Trinidad were really Third
                        World. Because those were islands that had had going economies since the
                        early 20th century. So they were like Mexico, borderline, well, not even as
                        bad as Mexico. But Brazil, northeast Brazil, definitely Third World. Sierra
                        Leone, Morocco, yes and no. It was sad to see the underemployed people who
                        had absolutely no hope. They had nowhere to go.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: So what do these people do?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They just live from day to day, and they have no great
                        expectations. But they try to do better for their children. Actually, it's
                        the American dream at a very low level. They don't have our high
                        expectations but they just try to house, clothe, educate and feed their
                        children better than they themselves were. And we have street people who
                        can't even hope to do that. There are growing numbers and we see them in
                        Washington. All the time now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: That's it, and you feel you're up against a wall — that they are up
                    against a wall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A lot of those people have emotional and mental problems
                        and I did in Washington work with feeding some of them. I went to a feeding
                        program and I think the one thing I learned is that there is not just one
                        general problem with the homeless. This homeless person has a mental
                        problem; this person has a job problem, just can't get a job. This one has
                        another problem, has a record, a prison or drug record, or something. It's
                        not just one homeless problem. It's a lot of problems that need to be dealt
                        with in different ways. I'm not quite sure that we realize that and are
                        dealing with it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: The mental problem. Some of these people should be given some
                    psychiatric help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course they should never have been released from
                        wherever they were. There is very little home support.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I don't know how you deal with something like that. Although individuals
                    can help, you can't do it just with private support. The government has got to
                    give some support to these people in some way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have that man, Mitch Schneider, in Washington who has
                        fasted, practically done himself in, but he has finally gotten some money
                        from the federal government and he is rehabilitating a big shelter.</hi>

                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>SERVICE: I've read about him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But shelters aren't always the answer. They become a sort
                        of a jungle.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: I think that is almost inevitable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a lot of poor people in China in the '30's. Wasn't
                        there, as there usually is in the Third World, a built-in family social
                        security even though you have nothing to share?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. Chinese family structure has always been extremely strong. But a
                    lot of people in the old China were born on the streets, and they lived on the
                    streets, and they died on the streets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the streets, as in India.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes. There were so many beggars. But today we have beggars here too. In
                    China foreigners used to say how awful it was that these people should be on the
                    streets. But we thought that is the way it was in China. That the Chinese
                    weren't up to doing things any better. But what we didn't think about was the
                    enormous number of people. At that time about 450,000,000 people. Now there are
                    over one billion. The Chinese are doing a remarkable job in feeding, clothing,
                    and housing this vast number of people. You do see a few beggars today. But it
                    seems to me that I saw no more in Peking or Shanghai than I see in San
                    Francisco. I think that over-population is going to be one of the most
                    threatening aspects of the future we're heading into.</p>
                <p>Can we return to wives with their own careers in the Foreign Service today? I'd
                    like to mention my daughter-in-law, Karol. She had her own career before she and
                    Bob were married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is her career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Karol was working for the Department of Labor. She's an economist. She
                    and Bob met in Nicaragua, Bob's first post. Karol was sent to Managua to do a
                    survey on labor conditions in Nicaragua. They didn't marry until two or three
                    years later, after Bob had been in Bahia. Karol is a marvelous Foreign Service
                    wife, but it is not her whole life, as it was with most of us old-time Foreign
                    Service wives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How does she keep up her career with all of these
                        moves?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>SERVICE: She hasn't been able to in Madrid. But in Chile — they were in Santiago
                    — she did contract work for the Department of Commerce. They would send her the
                    raw material of a survey, let us say, and then she'd get it all together and
                    write the report. I think I'm stating this correctly. Bob's next post is to be
                    DCM in Buenos Aires. I don't know if Karol has any plans of her own.</p>
                <p>I don't know how I would feel about a career of my own if I were a Foreign
                    Service wife today. I've always been very interested in whatever country I've
                    been in. Especially about the history and the cultural aspects, even more so
                    about the people of the country. I think there are very few substitutes for
                    being genuinely interested in your host country. I don't mean that you've got to
                    do a lot of good works if that's not your nature, or that you've got to tell
                    other people how to run their lives. I think, though, that if you have a real
                    interest in the lives of the people around you that they will understand this
                    and appreciate it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I think that people can also quickly perceive if you
                        don't have that interest and compassion and rapport.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Yes, I think so too. You can't compare conditions in countries abroad
                    with the way things are at home. Especially when it comes to Third World and
                    emerging countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You take it as it is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Because you're in a different situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're a guest in the other country, really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: Right. The one place that I did find difficult, at first, was Yunnanfu
                    (Kunming). It was a shock.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It couldn't have been easy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SERVICE: It was a great shock to me to see how poor and miserable the Chinese
                    were in that backward place. I was not prepared for that. And also Jack had been
                    born and brought up in west China so the things that bothered me did not bother
                    Jack.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could he understand why you were...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>SERVICE: He couldn't, at first, understand my negative reactions to many things
                    that seemed perfectly normal to him. But later on he did. And I began to open my
                    mind and my eyes — to grow up, to be less parochial in my thinking.</p>
                <p>This must be one of the great rewards of Foreign Service life — both for
                    Americans as Foreign Service families abroad, and for our foreign friends and
                    hosts.</p>
                <p>I'd like to close with a Chinese wish: “Yi Lu Ping An” which means, “May your
                    Road Be Peaceful.”</p>
