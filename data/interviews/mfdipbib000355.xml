                <p>Introduction</p>
                <p>Origins And Development Of The Binational Centers Program</p>
                <p>Mr. John Ewing was for many years a Binational Center contract employee. The
                    following two transcripts are made from recordings done by Mr. Ewing himself at
                    his home in Eugene, Oregon, at the request of the USIA Oral History Project.</p>
                <p>They deal with the development of the Binational Centers (BNCs) in Mexico City
                    and more broadly, throughout Brazil. The BNC program was a separate phase of the
                    USIA experience, initially outside the direct jurisdiction of the U. S.
                    Information Service (USIS) offices overseas. Although there were Binational
                    Centers established in countries other than those of the Western Hemisphere,
                    (notably in Germany and Austria immediately after World War II) the BNC program
                    was initially, and remains predominantly, a Latin American phenomenon. Its
                    genesis was in Latin America under the auspices of the Rockefeller interests,
                    and was known in and somewhat before WWII days as Nelson Rockefeller's Institute
                    of Inter-American Affairs (IIA). With the formation of The Office of War
                    Information, IIA came under the latter's general control and financing, and so
                    remained for the duration of the War. The nature of the program in its
                    beginning, and its development into a much wider cultural enterprise, is covered
                    in the texts of the two part presentation that follows.</p>
                <p>By the end of the War, BNCs were already booming in Latin America, and were
                    rapidly becoming highly popular, as well as effective instruments of American
                    Public Diplomacy. However, they did not remain directly an arm of the US
                    Government immediately after the termination of OWI. In 1948, the so-called
                    Smith-Mundt Act was passed by Congress, providing authority for a US
                    Government-operated public diplomacy program. The US Information and Education
                    program—USIE—one of the predecessor agencies of USIA—was established as an
                    office in the State Department, which soon took over the USIA offices (USIS)
                    abroad that had been established under OWI, and from that time forward, operated
                    USIS in each country as a section of the Embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>The Binational Centers, however, remained as autonomous entities, outside direct
                    USIS supervision. In some cases such as is outlined in Part I of the following
                    summary of the development of the BNC in Mexico City, the State Department
                    assisted the centers with grants to university language institutes to help set
                    up English language training, and later, by direct grants to individuals to work
                    in the Centers as contract employees of the Information/Education part of the
                    State Department. Gradually Binational Centers Boards of Directors, usually half
                    resident Americans and half host country nationals, were established. These
                    Boards generally set operational policy, and hired host country staff. The U. S.
                    Government, through USIS, provided considerable financial support, and supplied
                    a Center Director (as well as, on occasion, one or more other American staff
                    members) to direct the “hands on” BNC activities.</p>
                <p>When, in 1953, USIA was created, and separated from State, USIS offices abroad
                    were operated by the new Agency. The Americans in the Centers were still not for
                    some years made USIA officers. Although they were recruited and trained by the
                    Agency, they were still taken on as contract employees, entitled to none of the
                    career perquisites of retirement benefits of regular USIA Foreign Service
                    personnel. It was only in the 1960's that USIA was able to bring these dedicated
                    employees into the Agency's Foreign Service, and make them career officers. When
                    integration into the Foreign Service finally came, another waiting period
                    elapsed before legal authorization was obtained giving them retirement credit as
                    Agency Foreign Service Officers for their years in BNC contract status. The BNCs
                    themselves, however, in most countries, have never become US Government
                    entities, even though directed by USIS Officers. Financial as well as personnel
                    support is often given by the Centers' autonomy remains intact.</p>
                <p>Well before the American Center personnel were integrated, USIS treated them as
                    part of the USIS team, integrated their program planning with USIS cultural
                    programming, and, in fact, conducted a large part of the USIS directed cultural
                    program overseas through the centers in countries where they existed. Since,
                    however, the BNCs raised substantial portions of their own funds—in many cases a
                    majority of their operating expenses—through English teaching and other
                    activities, they were in large part self supporting. And since they each had a
                    board of directors, often containing some of the leading and most prestigious
                    host country nationals, there were frequently times when the BNC Board's ideas
                    of operational priorities clashed with Embassy/USIS preferences. But that is
                    another story. It is enough to remark that when this condition existed, it often
                    placed the American personnel of the Center in a difficult position. (Written by

                <p>The Genesis Of The Binational Center ProgramMexico City, June 1946 To May
                    1950</p>

                <p>EWING: This recording concerns the beginning of one of the Binational Centers
                    that was to make a significant contribution to one of the most successful public
                    relations programs ever undertaken by the US Information Agency or its
                    predecessor agencies. As early as 1919, President Woodrow Wilson made the
                    observation at the Paris Peace Conference that, “It will not suffice to satisfy
                    governmental circles anywhere. It is necessary that we should satisfy the
                    opinion of mankind.”</p>
                <p>It was not, however, until during World War II that our nation's overseas
                    diplomacy was to begin to establish institutions to help do this. It began as a
                    series of small American libraries in a number of important cities throughout
                    the Allied world. They first functioned under the auspices of the Office of War
                    Information. These libraries were based on the now-proven theory that many
                    people, among them many opinion makers, would like to satisfy their curiosity
                    about us by reading the books and magazines that were available in the United
                    States but hard to find in other countries. These same small libraries provided
                    exhibits, films, and introduction as needed to native English speakers and
                    language study. These budding information centers were an outstanding success
                    from the beginning.</p>
                <p>After the war, appropriations were cut, and this early experience with the
                    dispersal of successful overseas diplomacy through information that was made
                    available in small grassroots institutions came to an end. The outcry and
                    protests by those who had benefited was quick and loud. The foreign information
                    program was soon to be revived and its scope broadened. The State Department's
                    international institutes and libraries reopened the old wartime libraries, and
                    new ones were established, among them, the Benjamin Franklin Library on the
                    Placeo de la Reforma in Mexico City. The popularity of this institution by 1946
                    was hard to believe. It was the only lending library in Mexico and it was used
                    intensively by the government opinion makers and by the general public.</p>
                <p>English Language Teaching Becomes ACentral BNC Program</p>
                <p>As the post-war exchange of persons program developed with the United States, and
                    between educational and government institutions, a great need to learn to speak
                    English arose. It became evident that English language classes must be made
                    available by the library. The University of Michigan was invited to send down a
                    team of English-teaching specialists and linguists, to make a linguistic
                    analysis of how to teach English to Spanish-speaking people.</p>
                <p>In the process of doing this, the study group established within the Benjamin
                    Franklin Library a center for learning English. The well known Dr. Freize of the
                    English language Institute at Ann Arbor was to direct this extension institution
                    and the English language research team. The American Institute of Learned
                    Societies volunteered to help fund it. The future efficiency of USIA worldwide
                    English teaching program and the many new Binational Centers that were to soon
                    come into existence in Latin America all benefited greatly by the research and
                    tests materials developed by the University of Michigan team.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>The director of the library, Dr. Andy Wilkinson, recruited me to teach part-time
                    while I was doing graduate work in Latin American Studies at the National
                    University of Mexico. My salary was paid by the American Institute of Learned
                    Societies. I had previously had experience in administration and teaching
                    English to Mexicans in a school on the Mexican border, and in Montemorelos, in
                    the northern part of Mexico.</p>
                <p>Ewing Becomes Grant Employee of Mexico City BNC</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1947, I was recruited by Dr. William Cody, the cultural attach�
                    of the American Embassy, to apply for a State Department grant that would permit
                    me to join the team of the English Language Institute officially at the Benjamin
                    Franklin Library. I went to Washington and was interviewed by Elizabeth Hopkins,
                    who in those early years was the personnel officer for the Binational Center
                    grantees. These grantees, after training, were being sent to newly established
                    Binational Centers overseas.</p>
                <p>I returned to Mexico City with a grant that permitted me to teach and participate
                    full-time in the research and writing of materials. One of the most valuable
                    benefits for me was the in-service training seminars conducted by Dr. Freize and
                    his assistant, Margaret Moyam. In these training sessions and seminars, the
                    philosophy of English teaching and methods of teaching English as a second
                    language developed that was to spread to all of Latin America. The oral method
                    was further developed there, and ear training and speaking of conversational
                    English by Spanish-speaking students became popularly known as the
                    hearing-speaking method. Importance was given to teaching conversational English
                    that brought quicker and more satisfactory results than the old translation
                    method. The structure of the language was drilled and taught in understandable
                    classroom experience. Learning more easily took place in a hearing and doing
                    experience. The language was introduced and drilled into oral fashion, but the
                    four skills of language—hearing, speaking, reading, and writing—were experienced
                    in parallel classroom exercise.</p>
                <p>Demand For English Instruction Overwhelms Mexican Center</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>The results obtained in a relatively short period of exposure soon flooded the
                    institute with requests for enrollment by Mexican government employees, business
                    concerns, and schools. The program was too successful for the space available
                    and the quarters available to us in Benjamin Franklin Library. It was evident
                    that there was a real need for a Binational Center in Mexico City. I shall never
                    forget registration day, the period before we moved into our Yucatan 63
                    building. That was made possible by a State Department grant in 1947. We had
                    needed as large an enrollment as possible if we were soon to meet the expense of
                    maintaining the rent of our own building, so we put our first ad for students in
                    the newspaper. To our horror, the line of people to register was over three
                    blocks long. We had to call for the help of the police to keep order until a
                    solution could be worked out. We took all we could, which was only a few over
                    300. Then we mimeographed an announcement that we would have room for everyone
                    at the new location in about 12 weeks. The publicity of this event in the
                    newspapers guaranteed us a full house when the BNC opened that fall.</p>
                <p>The excellent work of the University of Michigan's extension institute was coming
                    to a close. Its personnel left or had been converted to BNC grantees. Frank
                    Thompson, who had been serving as the director of courses in the transition
                    period to BNC personnel, was transferred. I was assigned as director of courses
                    for the new BNC. I had been the understudy of Margaret Moyam, whose work I tried
                    to carry on as we set up the expanded new center. With the help of other BNC
                    grantees, we had to organize and train 50 new teachers in order to meet the
                    needs of the new enrollment. The enrollment was to increase from a few hundred
                    professional people at the Benjamin Franklin Library to more than 3,000 at the
                    new location by May of 1950. We no longer were just a very successful English
                    language institute; we were now a fully organized Binational Center, with a
                    local board of directors and a full cultural relations program.</p>
                <p>To indicate the expanded program, our new name was El Instituto Mexicano-Norte
                    Americano de Relaciones Culturales —the Mexican-American Institute of Cultural
                    Relations. We had the full program support of our mother institution, the
                    Benjamin Franklin Library, and its personnel. Dr. William Bias was recruited
                    from the University of Illinois International Institutes and Libraries to be our
                    first administrative director.</p>
                <p>Mexico City BNC Further Expands In BothSize And Program Scope</p>
                <p>An auditorium was built on the premises. Lectures by visiting American professors
                    were scheduled, concerts of American music and exhibits of life in the United
                    States, as well as a regular schedule of documentary and informational films,
                    were all part of the center's cultural program. This was made available to both
                    students and members of the center. The American community was encouraged to
                    take part in the cultural and social activities of the center. It was popular
                    not only to become a registered member of the center, but many became students
                    of Spanish, which we taught using the same successful methods we had learned to
                    us in the English Language Institute.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>The BNC grantees such as Jim and Katherine Passereli, Molly Moore, Virginia
                    Williams, and I helped with this cultural and social program, as well as
                    continuing to perfect the English teaching materials left behind by the
                    University of Michigan team. They were soon published in book form, books one to
                    eight. I was in charge of writing a new introductory course of study that we
                    called preparatory, which we required all new students to take for 12 weeks
                    before they took placement tests to be enrolled in homogeneous groups in the
                    regular courses of one to eight.</p>
                <p>In future years, these original materials were to develop into an improved series
                    of textbooks that were to be shared and sold in many other Latin American
                    countries. Even in the early years, American cultural content was built into
                    these books. It was the precept of Dr. Freize that our language is best taught
                    in context with the culture of our country, our vocabulary best taught in a
                    phrase, and our intonation in conversation.</p>
                <p>USIA Becomes Center Sponsor—Conducts Its CulturalProgramming Through Center</p>
                <p>The Binational Center was sponsored by USIA, and their activities were to come
                    the closest to education in the purest sense of the word. By 1954, there would
                    be 35 Binational Centers in the principal cities of the free world.
                    Unfortunately, in those early years, the American grantees often had to return
                    to their universities after a short assignment. This became an administrative
                    weakness in institution building. Dr. Bias could only stay away from his
                    university one year. When he left, I became acting director for eight or nine
                    months until Dr. Elmindorf arrived in 1949.</p>
                <p>Center Membership Becomes A StatusSymbol Among Mexicans</p>
                <p>In 1948, we had issued attractive enamel membership pins displaying the two flags
                    in color as a part of a membership drive that was looking forward to the day,
                    not far off again, when we would have to move to larger quarters in order to
                    accommodate those who wanted to be a part of the Mexican-American Cultural
                    Relations Program. These pins could be seen in government offices, at the
                    university, and in many business establishments. It was in style to be a member
                    of the Binational Center in those years.</p>
                <p>By 1949, we had established two branch centers in different parts of the city. A
                    few months before my transfer to Brazil in 1950, I was sent to Guadalajara to
                    select and train teachers for the new Binational Center that was opening in
                    space that had been made available by the University of Guadalajara. The parent
                    center in Mexico City at Yucatan 63 by that time was bursting at its seams. Its
                    popular cultural program was seriously handicapped for the lack of space to
                    accept all who wished to participate. The center was soon to move again into
                    larger and more permanent quarters that were more suited to a successful
                    cultural exchange and English teaching program.</p>

                <p>Success Of BNC Programming Demonstrates That Cultural Activities Are An Integral
                    And Vital Part of U. S. “Propaganda” Overseas</p>
                <p>In many years since, this very special Binational Center has enjoyed high
                    prestige, not only in Mexico, but in Latin America at large. By 1953, members of
                    the United States Advisory Commission on Information were able to state in their
                    report of January 1953 that our work in the field should become less and less
                    that of Americans conducting propaganda on foreign soil, and more and more a
                    partnership arrangement between Americans and others, to the mutual welfare of
                    both.</p>
                <p>In 1955, Oren Stephens, the USIA Deputy Assistant Director for Policy and
                    Programs, was to write in his book, Facts to a Candid World, the following: “Of
                    all propaganda, the most effective is that which has the least appearance of
                    propaganda. The greater seeming objectivity of the material, the more it will be
                    accepted as disinterested and reliable information on which the audience can
                    base a judgment.”</p>
                <p>The Binational Center program was right on course, and it would expand
                    dramatically during the period from 1950 to 1960, especially in Brazil. I was
                    transferred to Porto Alegre, Brazil, in May of 1950. This assignment was to
                    begin with further training in Washington in linguistics and American Studies
                    under Professors Smith and Tragor. Binational Center grantees were being taught
                    to be cultural ambassadors to the overseas Binational Centers, where they would
                    serve as administrative directors, directors of courses, or directors of
                    activities. Each would be a catalyst in a Binational Center for the United
                    States information program.</p>
                <p>BNCs Are Largely Self Sustaining</p>
                <p>One question remains, and it was often asked by those who were not well
                    acquainted with the BNC program: “How could USIA afford to pay for such an
                    extensive program, especially during periods when Congress was reluctant to
                    allocate funds for the overseas information program?”</p>
                <p>The truth of the matter is that for every dollar USIA invested, another four were
                    soon being generated locally through the income from English teaching and
                    membership fees. More and more through the years, the BNC grantees became the
                    secret of success for the Binational Centers. They furnished the administrative
                    know-how and the catalysts for dispersing American cultural and information.
                    Without them, the center would soon take on the personality of a host country
                    institution. Once a center was well organized, it could roll with the fortunes
                    of the annual USIS budget, as well or better as far as materials and equipment
                    were concerned.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>The one thing they could not do without and remain binational in its program for
                    very long was its Binational Center grantee personnel. Each person who studied
                    English paid for his classes 12 weeks in advance. Each member of the center paid
                    for his membership fee 12 months in advance. It is true that the BNC director
                    had to learn to be a good businessman, but the director of institutions anywhere
                    must have that quality. One of the most successful parts of the program was the
                    recruiting and training of BNC grantees at the Washington level. USIA and its
                    predecessor agency were fortunate to have the same personnel officer from the
                    '40s through the '70s. We all considered Elizabeth Hopkins our Mother Superior
                    in almost everything that made things tick.</p>

                <p>The Brazilian Binational Center Program, September 1950 to December 1952 and
                    September 1955 to May 1960</p>
                <p>EWING: During the five-year period of 1955 to 1960, five new centers opened in 30
                    cities in Brazil. Before I speak of the rapid expansion of the Brazilian
                    Binational Center Program during the five-year period of 1955 and 1960, I wish
                    to record my experience as Director of the Porto Alegre Center because it was to
                    become the prototype for new Centers when I became USIS country Binational
                    Center Officer in 1955.</p>
                <p>After having spent the summer in Washington attending seminars and lectures in
                    American studies and applied linguistics taught by Professors Smith and Trager,
                    I arrived in Porto Alegre, Brazil, as Director of Courses for the recently
                    founded Binational Center. Porto Alegre was the capital city of Rio Grande do
                    Sul, the home state of President Getulio Vargas, who had been Brazil's dictator
                    since 1937. It was Getulio Vargas that had made the notable “March to the West”
                    speech as early as 1940. Though President Vargas' dream was not to be
                    implemented until 1955 and by another president, the dream was firmly planted.
                    It had only been delayed during the political turmoil and during the war
                    years.</p>
                <p>Beginning Of Porto Alegre's Binational CenterRise To High Success</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, Porto Alegre was very much alive in the fall of 1950. Progress was
                    very much on the minds of everyone. The big question was what method should be
                    used to get there. The lines were being drawn between socialism, nationalism,
                    and Pan Americanism. Rio Grande do Sul was also the home of a future disaster in
                    the making and a future president, Joao Goulart, a young prot�g� of President
                    Vargas.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>A Brazilian American Binational Center was very much needed to help establish a
                    cultural exchange program that could diplomatically and yet effectively educate
                    an interested public concerning the culture of the United States of America.
                    They wanted to learn the English language and to learn firsthand about the
                    country that had made it possible to defeat Hitler's plan for the world.</p>
                <p>The Center had been opened on the main street of the city. The quarters were
                    small and limited in space for meeting the needs of a full cultural program.
                    There was not enough space for all those who wished to learn English. Our
                    enrollment was around 600 students. We began to look around, and a few weeks
                    after my arrival, an opportunity presented itself for us to lease space on the
                    eleventh and twelfth floors of a new 12-story building in downtown Porto
                    Alegre.</p>
                <p>The Director of the Center, Dr. Solmonson, had to return to the United States. I
                    became Executive Director, and Gloria Wasaluski became Director of Courses.
                    Howard Hill was the USIS branch public affairs officer. This was to be the
                    American team that worked together to build one of the finest Binational Center
                    institutions anywhere.</p>
                <p>Our first task was to find a progressive experienced administrator to be
                    president of the Board of Directors. For political reasons, we determined that
                    the president of the Board of Directors should always be a Brazilian. Dr. Acho
                    was recruited. He was a former president of the Porto Alegre University of Rio
                    Grande do Sul. Dr. Acho enthusiastically joined our team and not only
                    contributed to the building of a strong and respected Binational Center, but his
                    ideas of organization and ways of reaching the Brazilian public carried over
                    into the period when I was country BNC officer from 1955 to 1960 in Rio de
                    Janeiro. Dr. Acho's idea was that an institution, especially a Binational
                    Center, would be stronger if no one individual was permitted to dominate his
                    position for longer than three years at a time. This would be a built-in
                    insurance policy for an embryo democracy in a country that had had very little
                    experience in democratic government.</p>
                <p>To get it all started, our team chose an executive committee of three members to
                    serve on the Board of Directors. Dr. Acho was to be the president of the Board,
                    with a vice president and a treasurer. Each of these men was to serve three
                    years. Three others were appointed, each to serve two years as chairpersons of
                    the program, library, and academic committees. The remaining three on the Board
                    of Directors of nine were to serve one year as chairpersons on the social,
                    scholarship, and art committees. At the end of the first year, three members of
                    the Board would be replaced each year to serve three years. The retiring Board
                    members each year would become members of the Binational Center Council. This
                    arrangement kept the Center from taking on the personality of the strong man on
                    the Board of Directors. This already had become a problem in some of the older
                    Binational Centers in Latin America.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>The Board of Directors met once a month, and each working committee met at least
                    once a month. The American grantee executive director was a member of each of
                    the working committees. The American grantee director, of course, was a member
                    of the academic and scholarship committees, and an ex-officio member of the
                    Board. This was an important arrangement because in the absence of the grantee
                    executive director, the grantee director of courses was to serve as the
                    executive director. The USIS public affairs officer also was a member of the
                    Board of Directors. Though the two American grantees and the USIS branch PAO
                    were members of the Board, they were ex-officio members. They were there to give
                    and receive information. Nevertheless, their leadership was vital to the success
                    of the plan. They, along with the president of the Board, were the catalysts.
                    The president of the Board often attended a working committee to give and
                    receive program information.</p>
                <p>The involvement of each member of the team in the program and the dedication of
                    the area USIS officer to the BNC program was the secret of success. In later
                    years, when BNC grantees became USIS officers and BNC objectives and projects
                    were written into the USIS country plan, all this became more institutionalized
                    and it became much easier to accomplish an ongoing rapport with BNC
                    leadership.</p>
                <p>Whenever possible, the Board of Directors was made up of five Brazilians and four
                    Americans. Anyone reviewing the early history of Binational Centers may feel
                    that a democratic rotating Board of Directors was not such an important
                    historical event to record, but certainly in 1950 it was. It is even today in
                    many parts of Latin America.</p>
                <p>State Department Grant Assists NecessaryMove To Larger Quarters</p>
                <p>Once the basic organization of the Center was taken care of, we were ready to
                    push ahead with moving into our new quarters. This move was helped by a State
                    Department grant. This grant made it possible to furnish beautiful quarters for
                    an auditorium, library, offices, and classrooms. The beautiful terraces at each
                    end of the building provided additional space for social activities. They looked
                    out over the city of Porto Alegre and its harbor. Being the tallest building in
                    town, everybody knew it. The Center was a showplace in the city, and it became
                    popular immediately.</p>
                <p>The academic department under the dedicated leadership of Gloria Wasaluski
                    prospered. The enrollment increased by over 1,000 students within a period of
                    months. Students participated in the library activities, and many attended
                    cultural and social programs. Our goal was that they should remain members of
                    the Center after their study of the language had formally ended. The age group
                    in these classes ranged from 16 to 60. Children were provided with cultural and
                    social activities, which brought popularity to the Center from among its
                    membership. Within months after moving into the new quarters, people were coming
                    to join the Center. Some of them spoke English, but they wished to enjoy the
                    cultural activities and to have library privileges.</p>

                <p>BNC Becomes Popular As Source Of Learning AboutUSA - Reverses Anti-American
                    Feelings</p>
                <p>The library of American authors and reference materials provided by USIA supplied
                    a hungry audience and an audience made up of from among government workers,
                    universities, and schools, as well as from our own membership. The library
                    opened onto the terrace, and it was a very pleasant place to read an American
                    magazine or to do reference work. The library staff carried on a full schedule
                    of library-related activities for its members. The American grantees took part
                    in scheduled discussion groups and forums. Our auditorium and our social hall
                    provided a meeting place for the State Department Exchange of Persons grantees
                    and American visitors. A monthly newsletter and calendar of activities were
                    mailed to members and advertised in the newspapers.</p>
                <p>In 1952, we put together an album of pictures and graphs of the Porto Alegre
                    Binational Center Program and mailed it to ICS in Washington to be used in the
                    BNC grantee training program. This had been prompted by a suggestion by someone
                    at the Lima Conference of Cultural Officers and BNC Grantees for South America
                    that was held in November of 1951. I had presented the democratic principles of
                    organization under which the Porto Alegre Center had been operating. Our success
                    had seemed of interest to others. In every way we were accepted by the end of
                    1952 in what had been a very nationalistic city. The American story was being
                    heard and it was becoming much more difficult in the community to be
                    anti-American because of the effectiveness of the American cultural and social
                    programs at the Binational Center.</p>
                <p>A few weeks before I arrived in Porto Alegre in 1950, the entrance hall of the
                    American consulate had been painted with tar by vandals. During all this period
                    of growth and popularity, there was never any vandalism against the Binational
                    Center.</p>

                    Chile, in 1953, I was transferred to Guatemala City as Director of the
                    Binational Center, to help hold it together during the Arbenz revolution. This
                    fascinating experience I will leave to another recording, because it is a story
                    all in itself.</p>
                <p>After Casilio Armis marched into the city from Salvador and all American
                    personnel was transferred out and replaced by new blood, I was transferred to
                    Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. It had been renamed Ciudad Trujillo. As
                    Director of the Center, I was still working as a State Department grantee. The
                    Binational Center had the blessing of dictator Trujillo, even though I had
                    reorganized this Board of Directors on the Porto Alegre pattern and it was
                    functioning well as a micro-democracy.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>When it came time for me to put license plates on my car, I was not entitled to
                    diplomatic plates because I did not have a diplomatic passport. President
                    Trujillo insisted, to my embarrassment, that my car carry official plates. This
                    meant that all traffic stopped for me at intersections and that I was always
                    given the right-of-way. His reasoning was that the American Cultural Center was
                    binational.</p>
                <p>1955: Back To Brazil As Country Director Of BNCs</p>
                <p>After 11 months as Director of the Binational Center in the Dominican Republic, I
                    was appointed as a USIS staff officer, and transferred back to Rio de Janeiro to
                    serve as the area BNC officer for Brazil. My wife and I arrived there in
                    September 1955. This, then, begins the second part of my recording which
                    concerns the rapid expansion of the Brazilian Binational Center Program.</p>
                <p>Upon my arrival in Brazil, again, in September 1955, I was pleased to learn that
                    the Binational Center family had increased to 17. When I had gone to Porto
                    Alegre in 1950, there had only been seven Centers in the whole of Brazil. In
                    January of 1953, the United States Advisory Commission on Information had stated
                    in their report to the Agency that, “Our work in the field should become less
                    and less that of Americans conducting propaganda on foreign soil, and more and
                    more a partnership arrangement between Americans and others for the mutual
                    welfare of both.” This statement and the general curiosity about Americans after
                    the war had served the cause of Binational Centers well in Brazil.</p>
                <p>After I was able to set up my office in USIS Rio de Janeiro, located in the
                    Embassy, I felt that it was necessary to visit each of the Centers and meet with
                    their Boards of Directors. This gave me a good understanding of what was being
                    accomplished among them as a USIS binational tool. Many of the Centers at that
                    time were little more than English-language institutes, much like the Mexican
                    City Center had been before it became a Binational Center, but with much less
                    professional guidance. Some of the larger Centers, such as the Centers in Sao
                    Paulo, Santos, Porto Alegre, Curitiba, and Rio de Janeiro, were true extensions
                    of USIS. The obvious problem would be how to bring all of them into a pattern
                    that would serve the needs of the State Department's Embassy, which had only
                    five or six consulates in a country half the area of South America and nearly
                    the size of the United States.</p>
                <p>Facts to a Candid World was published in 1955. It was written by Oren Stephens,
                    the USIA Deputy Assistant Director for Policy and Programs. What he had to say
                    in that book rang a bell with many of us: “Of all propaganda, the most effective
                    is that which has the least appearance of propaganda. The greater the seeming
                    objectivity of the material, the more it will be accepted as disinterested and
                    reliable information on which the audience can have a judgment.” Mr. Stephens'
                    counsel was excellent for American Binational Center grantees who found
                    themselves playing the role of cultural ambassadors in a country that had been
                    governed so long by a dictator, and where the democratic style was so little
                    known.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>President Getulio Vargas had committed suicide only the year before, in 1954,
                    bringing his 17-year rule to an abrupt end. The new president that took office
                    in 1955 was a charming and politically wily doctor named Juscelino Kubitschek.
                    He had campaigned hard on a platform that stressed democracy and rapid economic
                    progress. He had promised 50 years of development during his five-year term from
                    1955 to early 1961. By the time I arrived in September of 1955, his efforts were
                    already under way to make Brazil's dream come true. He soon founded the national
                    auto industry. In time he built hydroelectric power plants and steel mills
                    throughout the country. One could feel the wave of euphoria that even a sudden
                    burst of inflation did little to dampen.</p>
                <p>President Kubitschek's Building of New BrazilianCapital (Brasilia) Spurs Rapid
                    BNC Expansion</p>
                <p>His most flamboyant gesture, outside of restoring democracy, was to resurrect a
                    postscript to Brazil's first Constitution of 1824 that called for a capital to
                    be known as Brasilia, to be constructed somewhere near the center of the
                    country. Locking hard on this idea, Kubitschek was to start the “March to the
                    West” that Vargas had dreamed about in his speech in 1940. He hired two
                    prominent architects, Lucio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer, and mounted a crash
                    program to build the new capital high on Brazil's central plateau. It would be a
                    full 16-hour drive northwest of Rio de Janeiro. It was this great expansion to
                    the West and into the interior of Brazil that gave the American Binational
                    Centers their opportunity to follow the frontier.</p>
                <p>In the near future, Brasilia was to become the launching pad for conquest of the
                    Mato Grosso [Large formidably underdeveloped area in Brazil's South Central
                    interior, encompassing (but exceeding in area) the Brazilian State of the same
                    name] and Amazonia [a similarly large and underdeveloped region in North Central
                    Brazil]. In the meantime, the new roads being cut to it from Rio de Janeiro and
                    Sao Paulo would being to many villages thousands of new inhabitants that would
                    make of them cities in the interior. They were hungry for schools and education
                    to meet the challenge of thefrontier. This frontier gave them land and
                    opportunities for business undreamed of for generations. The Rotary Club and the
                    Lions Club began their work, along with the American Binational Centers that
                    came into these new and booming cities. It was a time of high spirits and
                    courage, all sparked by a wily president who dared to do all this in the name of
                    democracy.</p>
                <p>Organization Of A Country-Wide BNC Network Enabled BNCs To Penetrate Schools,
                    Universities, Media, And Cultural Establishments And Gain Brazilian Government
                    Support</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>After my return from visiting all of the existing Binational Centers, I was
                    certain that the only way USIS would be successful in meeting the challenge
                    being presented to it would be to tie closely what we were able to do with these
                    Centers into the country plan. USIS would have specific goals and projects to
                    support each fiscal year. These goals and project must, in order to be
                    successful, meet with the approval of the country team. From the very beginning,
                    the program had the full support of Ambassador Briggs, the country public
                    affairs officer, John McKnight, his deputy, Lew Schmidt, the cultural affairs
                    officer, Larry Morris and, later, his replacement, Dulaney Terret. These men,
                    including the USIS executive officer Jim Opsata, gave program support to the
                    American Binational Centers, to me, and to the BNC grantees whom I helped
                    supervise. Without this coordinated effort by the country team, the program
                    would soon have died on the vine.</p>
                <p>It was determined by USIS that we needed a system that would formalize our
                    recognition of a Binational Center that wished to receive the official help and
                    guidance of the Embassy. Impressive certificates of recognition were printed.
                    When the Center, either new or long established, met the requirements for
                    Embassy recognition, a certificate signed by the USIS cultural officer and the
                    president of the Board of Directors was presented to a joint session of the
                    Board of Directors and the Center's council. This method presented an
                    opportunity to update the Center's government on BNC standards and their
                    significance.</p>
                <p>During 1955 and 1956, we had laid the groundwork for the USIS BNC program in
                    Brazil. I had visited all the existing Centers and explained the countrywide
                    standards that had been set by the country team. We were then ready to start
                    responding seriously to the many requests for organizational visits from
                    would-be Binational Centers.</p>
                <p>The workload of the country BNC officer had increased to the point that he could
                    no longer travel as much as was required and keep up with the office work at the
                    Embassy. USIA Washington agreed to give the country BNC officer a deputy and one
                    more local employee. Jack Fawcett, the Director of the Curitiba Center, was
                    appointed an FSS officer and deputy BNC country officer for USIS Rio De Janeiro.
                    This permitted one USIS BNC officer to be at the Embassy and another in the
                    field at all times. Regularly, after a month of travel, I came back to the
                    office and my deputy left to catch up on requests for help that had occurred
                    during the month. During my first 18 months in Brazil, I slept in 30 different
                    cities in all parts of Brazil.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Our travel was by plane whenever possible, but very often there was no way to get
                    to some of the cities in the interior but by car or jeep. On the Amazon, we had
                    to travel by boat. In 1957, the USIS office in Sao Paulo had received a request
                    for training seminars for Binational Centers in Piracicaba and Barretos. After
                    my wife and I had spent a week in each city, we decided to answer requests for a
                    visit by a new city on the border of the Mato Grosso and in the northwestern
                    part of the state of Sao Paulo. This was Votuporanga. President Kubitschek had
                    suggested to one of its Rotary members that what Votuporanga needed was an
                    American Binational Center. So we decided to visit the city fathers and their
                    Rotary Club, to see what possibilities existed for such a Center.</p>
                <p>After having been presented with the keys of the city by the mayor of Barretos
                    for the English teaching and BNC leadership seminar, we had left Barretos early
                    in the morning in our specially built Hillman-Minx, which had oversized shock
                    absorbers and springs, as well as a heavy-duty cooling system and an extra low
                    gear. None of the roads were paved as we headed west and further into the
                    interior.</p>
                <p>Across the northern part of the state of Sao Paulo, we didn't meet another car
                    all morning. Finally, in the early afternoon when we joined the main newly cut
                    highway to Brasilia, we began to meet trucks and jeeps. We had to leave the main
                    highway to Brasilia near Mirasol, where we had organized a Center the previous
                    year.</p>
                <p>Our trip had been complicated by a heavy rain the night before. The ruts in the
                    red clay road were becoming so deep that our car was in danger of getting hung
                    up on them. Sure enough, the inevitable happened about 3:30 in the afternoon. We
                    were stuck fast. I had been told when I left Mirasol that in case we needed
                    help, a caravan of trucks on their way to Gernandopolis would be along in the
                    late afternoon. We saw no other traffic. Finally, sure enough, about 4:00
                    o'clock, we could see the trucks coming over the horizon of red mud. In those
                    days, Brazil's truck drivers were, as now, a very special breed of men. Along
                    with Kubitschek's march to the West, they provided the wheels and the good
                    natured helpfulness to travelers, no matter who they were. Twenty of these
                    frontiersmen surrounded our car and lifted it out of the deep rut so I could
                    drive straddling it. The caravan of eight or nine trucks followed. About 5:00
                    o'clock, we reached the outskirts of Votuporanga. Across the highway was strung
                    a meter-wide banner in red and blue on white, that read, “Welcome John J.
                    Ewing!”</p>
                <p>Our little Hillman and ourselves, covered with mud, drove under the banner, along
                    with the caravan of trucks with all horns blowing into the city to be received
                    by the welcoming committee. Some of these special men were to spend evenings on
                    layovers at Binational Centers en route from and to Sao Paulo. Old USIS
                    magazines from BNCs circulated among them.</p>
                <p>Votuporanga was to have its Binational Center. The next year we visited them
                    again for an additional training seminar, but by that time, USIS had a
                    four-wheel-drive jeep that we could use for such trips.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>My wife, Bertha Irene Ewing, who had been a Binational Center grantee in Chile
                    before I married her, was an invaluable help on these trips. Bertha is a
                    graduate of Hunter College and holds a master's degree from Middlebury College.
                    She was also a temporary instructor at Radcliffe and Harvard, where she was
                    doing graduate work before she joined the BNC program. When she was not
                    traveling with me or conducting a seminar on her own, she tutored the daughters
                    of President Kubitschek at Laranjeiras Palace in Rio de Janeiro. All of this was
                    volunteer work for Bertha, because in those days USIS wives could not be
                    employed by the US Government.</p>
                <p>By 1958, I had been able to recruit a person to fill the new slot provided for in
                    the USIS budget for locally hired English teaching specialists that could begin
                    to offer continuity in our English teaching efforts throughout the country. I
                    had persuaded Hal Madison to leave our competition in Sao Paulo, and join our
                    USIS BNC staff at the Embassy in Rio de Janeiro. He became the author of an
                    excellent series of textbooks that were used in Binational Centers, secondary
                    schools, and colleges throughout Brazil. He had the help of USIS BNC officers in
                    making the series of books one of the best courses of study available. With the
                    help of Mr. Madison, we were able to carry our program into the schools and
                    universities of Brazil.</p>
                <p>Each of the 23 BNC grantees participated each year in English language seminars
                    to help train English teachers in these schools. The seminars were held in ten
                    or 12 of the larger Centers, at least one in each state, to which private and
                    public school teachers could come for training during the summer months.</p>
                <p>Once a year, these same large Centers, under the supervision of American
                    grantees, administrated the University of Michigan Proficiency Examination and
                    the University of Pennsylvania Examination in American Studies. These
                    examinations were sponsored by USIA in cooperation with these two universities.
                    The certificates were issued by the universities for those who qualified and
                    they were presented in an annual ceremony by USIS and the Binational
                    Centers.</p>
                <p>The annual seminars for National Teachers of English were one of the best public
                    relations activities ever undertaken by USIS Brazil. They met with high approval
                    and encouragement from the Brazilian Government. While in Curitiba, Jack Fawcett
                    wrote an anthology and textbook of American literature for teaching American
                    literature in Brazilian schools. This invaluable text became popular in Brazil.
                    Upon joining the USIS BNC staff in Rio, Jack also wrote a USIS English teaching
                    course of study for radio. Attractive booklets were published and placed in
                    radio programs throughout the country for mailing to listeners. Each USIS
                    officer had his role to play.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>The book presentations program provided American works in both English and
                    Portuguese for BNC libraries. USIA ICS provided basic libraries as each Center
                    qualified. These were added to on an annual basis. ICS also provided
                    audio-visual aids and equipment as needed. Educational exchange officers
                    conducted many educational exchange efforts within a Binational Center context,
                    thus helping to promote the program and scholarship committees within the
                    Binational Centers. This provided educational exchange experience for both
                    countries. The Binational Center Scholarship Committee often served as scouts
                    for finding well-qualified candidates in their area for the Embassy or
                    Consulate's educational exchange program.</p>
                <p>The film section of USIS Rio obtained and dispersed film programs that circulated
                    among the Centers and often through them to schools and colleges. There was also
                    a USIA BNC speaker exchange program that was coordinated in the USIS office in
                    the Embassy.</p>
                <p>1957: Public Law 480 Funds Authorized For BuildingImprovement Grants To BNCs</p>
                <p>The press section of USIS paid attention to returning State Department grantees
                    and to BNC cultural programs and released information on these activities to the
                    Brazilian press. In 1957, our USIS executive officer, Jim Opsata, hit upon the
                    idea of using the PL 480 funds to make capital improvements among the Brazilian
                    Binational Centers. The first dispersal of these funds was to come in 1958 to
                    seven Binational Centers. The PL 480 funds in the end would come to a
                    considerable sum of over $4 million. We tried to find a way to set up a
                    Binational Center Foundation that would be the holding agent for making loans to
                    over 50 Binational Centers then in existence, and let the money flow back again
                    for reuse as needed by all the Brazilian family of Binational Centers. The
                    country team was in full agreement, but we could not get the agreement for the
                    plan approved in Washington.</p>
                <p>Grants were finally made to those Centers that qualified. Most of them were
                    building grants that permitted them to move into their own buildings. Some of
                    the grants were used by smaller Centers to make capital improvements or to take
                    out long-term leases on more adequate quarters. These grants were made each on
                    the condition that each Center raise an equal amount to match the funds to be
                    received from the PL 480 grant. This grant system gave stability to each Center,
                    as well as an opportunity to seek out local commitment and local support for the
                    Binational Center program. Attractive, well-equipped quarters became a boon to
                    the program. Most of the well-established Centers were able to raise matching
                    funds within a year after they became available.</p>
                <p>Some of the USIS officers in Rio de Janeiro were, in time, transferred to branch
                    offices as branch PAOs. This was a great asset for the area they went to. Jack
                    Fawcett was to be assigned to Porto Alegre, and Fred Dickens to Salvador
                    (Bahia). Howard Hill, my old colleague in Porto Alegre, had already been
                    transferred to Recife. These men kept alive the Binational Center philosophy
                    that had developed over the years we had spent together.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>I will relate here only the experience of Fred, who had been so helpful when he
                    was country educational exchange officer in the Embassy USIS office. In my
                    opinion, one of Fred's most creative efforts on behalf of Binational Centers
                    took place in Salvador (Bahia). Following the experience I had in Guadalajara,
                    Mexico, Fred proposed to the rector of the University of Bahia that the
                    university provide quarters, teachers, and staff for a university Binational
                    Center to be called the Institute of North American Studies. When the rector
                    accepted the idea in principle, Fred obtained clearance and support from USIS
                    Rio. Binational Center grantee Isabel de Herwig was named director. All
                    university faculty privileges and facilities were made available to her. A small
                    building with classrooms and a library of new books in English and in Portuguese
                    was provided.</p>
                <p>My wife and I went to Salvador (Bahia) and gave a two-week training seminar for
                    the teachers of the Center. In the first year, 1,300 university students
                    enrolled in the English language study and others in American studies. Hundreds
                    more were to view films and slide shows. This was the first university
                    Binational Center in Brazil, and expenditure of USIS funds was minimal.</p>
                <p>Fred Dickens and Isabel de Herwig's great success in this adventure was building
                    upon the outstanding success of the Bahia mother center that had been so well
                    served during the tenure of Jeff Sandel, the BNC grantee director who had
                    preceded Isabel. By the spring of 1960, there were 23 American Binational Center
                    grantees hard at work in 17 of the largest cities in Brazil. All had area duties
                    and they helped supervise and train local personnel for 40 other Centers. Every
                    major city on the Atlantic coast of Brazil had a Binational Center. Centers had
                    also been established in the larger of the interior cities, as well.</p>
                <p>The new center in Belem, at the mouth of the Amazon, was now prospering. Belem
                    had become a beachhead for another push into the interior by President
                    Kubitschek, this time from the north to Brasilia in the central plateau. A
                    2,100-kilometer highway, over half of which would be through very dense tropical
                    forest, two million people would soon settle along this road. Trucks and buses
                    between the two points became crowded with goods and people. Amazonia was now
                    integrated with the rest of the nation.</p>
                <p>We had already established a Binational Center in Manaus in early 1958. On that
                    trip I was the only passenger on the plane from Manaus to Brasilia. I sat in the
                    copilot's seat while he took a long nap. In 1959, my wife and I took a ship at
                    Belem after the training seminar there, and traveled six days and six nights to
                    Manaus on annual leave. Others from USIS met us there, where we held a seminar
                    for national teachers of English for all of Amazonia. The seminar was sponsored
                    jointly by USIS and the Binational Center.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>I was transferred to Washington in May of 1960. Jack Fawcett, my deputy country
                    BNC officer, was transferred to Porto Alegre as branch PAO. I suggested that
                    Sidney Vertz of the Rio de Janeiro Center be made country BNC officer. The
                    political climate had almost been perfect while the country was under the
                    administration of President Juscelino Kubitschek, but after Juscelino, Brazil
                    once again fell into political disarray. His elected successor was Janio
                    Quadros, a brilliant but unstable politician. He had campaigned with a broom as
                    his symbol and announced as his laudable, if quixotic, goal, the elimination of
                    widespread corruption in government. The Congress was apprehensive and failed to
                    corroborate his election for over six months. As a result, he resigned. In 1961,
                    the presidency passed into the hands of his vice president, Joao Goulart.</p>
                <p>Goulart was from Rio Grande do Sul, as had been Vargas. The primary shortcoming
                    of President Goulart, who, for long was widely accused of being far too soft on
                    the left, if not a Communist himself, was not his radicalism, but rather his
                    incompetence to govern. Under his administration, disorder became commonplace.
                    Shortages, strikes, and a runaway inflation all took their toll.</p>
                <p>Finally, on March 31, 1964, a military coup took place, and Goulart, along with
                    many leftist politicians and academics, clandestinely left Brazil.</p>
                <p>These years were hard on the morale of Binational Centers. The real and imagined
                    dangers to these micro-democracies put them in jeopardy of losing their hard-won
                    popularity. I will leave this new era and its story to my colleagues who
                    followed me. Many of these very special binational institutions still are
                    healthy and strong. The Rio de Janeiro Center recently celebrated its golden
                    anniversary.</p>
                <p>As long as there are men around like Dr. Belchior, who has been the real
                    Binational Center guardian angel ever since the 1950s, and men like Dr. Acho of
                    Porto Alegre, the miracle of the human spirit will live on. These Brazilian
                    Binational Center leaders have projected their dream and our dream far beyond
                    their own harbors. Yes, there will also be a Brazilian president again who
                    promotes progress through democracy, as did Juscelino Kubitschek.</p>
