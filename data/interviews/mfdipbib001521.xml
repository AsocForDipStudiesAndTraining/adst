                <p>Interviewed by: Michael Mahoney</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 24, 2003</p>

                <p>[Note: This interview was not edited by Ambassador Bosworth]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the 24th of February and we're at Tufts
                        University. This is an interview with Ambassador Stephen Bosworth. Mr.
                        Ambassador, could you start by telling us a little bit about your
                        background, where you were born and grew up and went to school and how you
                        got interested in the Foreign Service, that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Sure. I was born in Western Michigan and grew up there on a very small
                    farm. At the time my father was working in a lumberyard in Michigan in Grand
                    Rapids. He subsequently several years later went back to college himself and
                    became a high school teacher, but I spent the first 17 years of my life living
                    on this farm outside of Grand Rapids. I went to high school in a place called
                    Granville, Michigan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Public high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It was a very public high school, not a very good public high school,
                    frankly. It was a decent way to grow up and I guess I learned some habits that
                    have been useful to me later in life like most people who live on small farms.
                    Because I was, well, after I graduated from high school, I went to college. I
                    went to Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you happen to go there out of Grand Rapids?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I was a high school football player. My high school football coach had
                    played someplace with a fellow who was the director of the athletic information
                    at Dartmouth. He sent out postcards every year asking all of his friends if they
                    had anyone they thought might be able to play ivy league football who could also
                    be academically admitted to a place like Dartmouth. Without talking to me about
                    it, my coach sent my name in and the next thing I knew I was being flooded with
                    material from Dartmouth and became very captivated with the notion of going to
                    Dartmouth. I had no idea of what it was like. I had never been outside the state
                    of Michigan.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me back up. What year were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I was born in 1939.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, this is '39 and so what year would you have started
                        Dartmouth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I started at Dartmouth in 1957. I was in the class of 1961.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had never been outside of Michigan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, I'd actually been to Waterloo, Iowa once to participate in a 4-H
                    Club dairy cattle judging contest. That was my own foray outside the state. So,
                    Dartmouth College was quite a shock to me in many ways, a pleasant shock on the
                    whole, but I had done little in my earlier life to prepare me for it. I
                    graduated, well; I was at Dartmouth obviously for four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you major in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I ended up majoring in something called international relations only
                    because it was an interdisciplinary major that offered me the prospect of not
                    having to concentrate on any one field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you actually play football at Dartmouth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I played football one year and discovered that while I liked Dartmouth
                    very much I was not that enamored with college football. I did not play football
                    after my freshman year, but I had a General Motors scholarship at Dartmouth and
                    then as now athletics scholarships are not found at Dartmouth and other Ivy
                    League institutions. So, I was there and could stay even if I didn't want to
                    play football. The international relations major was an interdisciplinary major
                    and I had several professors who were quite influential in shaping my thinking
                    at the time. One of them indicated that he had been in the Foreign Service for a
                    few years right after World War II and told me that he thought it might be a
                    good idea for me to take the Foreign Service exam, which I did. I took the
                    Foreign Service exam and a few weeks later I took the law boards because the
                    other route that I saw as potentially open to me was to go to law school.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had made up your mind you weren't going back to live
                        in Michigan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I was not going back to live in Michigan. There was nothing for me in
                    Michigan except my parents who obviously I had remained close to when I went
                    back periodically, but the notion of living in Michigan held no appeal to me. I
                    guess that was one of the things one of the transformations that Dartmouth
                    provided and that had opened my horizons to a degree that going to a small
                    school in Michigan which would probably have been my alternative I never would
                    have done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you like about international relations as a field
                        to study?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I found the notion of being able to connect with other cultures with
                    other political systems. It seemed to me to offer a wider range of interests and
                    activities perhaps than most other occupations that I could think of. The law
                    was not something that I was drawn to, but law school quite frankly was another
                    way of temporizing the way I made a decision for a few years as to what I might
                    want to do. It was through this professor who suggested that I take the Foreign
                    Service exam that I first became interested in the Foreign Service. I
                    interviewed with a few companies in my senior year at Dartmouth and I remember
                    after one a rather interesting conversation. One of the interviewers said to me,
                    “You know, you really should not be interviewing with companies. You should be
                    trying to join the government in some capacity.” I think at that time he was
                    right. I took the Foreign Service exam, passed the written. I can still remember
                    driving, I borrowed a friend's car and drove down to Boston to take the orals
                    and in those years the orals were much different than they are now. They were
                    basically an extended two hour conversation with two or three senior FSOs who
                    asked you questions that they thought would demonstrate either the flexibility
                    or the breadth of your knowledge. They would tell you right after you finished
                    whether or not you passed. I finished this oral exam down here in what was
                    Scollay Square, which is now the Federal Center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in 1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: This was in 1961, the winter of 1961. It probably would have been
                    February or March and after the exam was over they called me back in and said
                    well, you passed, we'll be in touch with you as to how you can actually
                    contemplate joining the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any idea at that time sort of how much it
                        paid or any of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I had no notion about any of that. I knew that I would probably be
                    living overseas a good deal with my wife in various countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was the life you were interested in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It was the life and the profession I was interested in. I must say,
                    however, I was subsequently accepted at both Harvard and the University of
                    Michigan law schools. The fact that the Foreign Service was prepared to pay me a
                    salary however small and law schools were not, was at that stage in my life a
                    fairly important factor in my decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a strong academic record in college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Not terribly strong. I had not done very well my first year. It took me
                    a while to regain my footing after coming out of what was really a mediocre
                    public high school in Michigan. I eventually did quite well particularly in the
                    social sciences and in my major I did quite well. So, it was not that I was Phi
                    Beta Kappa, but I was a good student.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, they said that they would get in touch with you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They told me they would get in touch with me. I graduated in June. I
                    had put down a $25 deposit in the University of Michigan Law School which seemed
                    to me at that time like a lot of money. I went back to Michigan. My mother, who
                    was working in the public school system at that time, got me a job for the
                    summer, along with one of my brothers, installing playground equipment for the
                    school playground. I remember working out there in the hot sun thinking to
                    myself this was not exactly what most Dartmouth graduates had in mind as their
                    first job after leaving school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many siblings did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I had two brothers, both younger than me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they both stay in Michigan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, none of us stayed in Michigan. My younger brother followed me to
                    Dartmouth. He went there the year after I graduated and the middle brother went
                    to the University of Michigan and got his Ph.D. in economics when I was in
                    Washington. So, all three of us left the state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were doing the playground equipment.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I was doing the playground equipment and I got a telegram from the
                    State Department saying we're going to offer you an appointment as an FSO-8. The
                    starting salary I think as I recall was $5,200 a year. You should report to
                    Washington July 12 or something like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of 1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: 1961, the year I graduated from college, so I didn't really hesitate. I
                    sent back a telegram saying I accept. I'll be there. My father by this time had
                    gone back to college so the family was to say the least financially
                    strapped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your father do for a living?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, at that point he was a student. He had gone back to night school
                    first and then was in his final year at Western Michigan University of getting a
                    degree in education and the next year began as a high school teacher of English
                    and speech. That year when I was graduated and waiting to go to Washington my
                    mother was ill and of course not working. Both my brothers were in school, so it
                    was not, it was a financially tough time. Anyway, I went to Washington and
                    started the basic officer course. What was it the A-100 or something like that.
                    From the beginning I was very enthralled and very happy with that as a
                    career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did the basic officer course and at that time how did
                        you, did you have to do a language requirement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, I did Spanish because I was assigned, my first tour was Panama and
                    I studied Spanish for four months and then I had just been married to my first
                    wife and we left in March of '62.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any input into that assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I had indicated that I was eager or interested in Latin America as a
                    region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that because of studying it in college?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, I had taken a couple of courses that had something to do with Latin
                    America in college, but I also wanted to get a language proficiency as soon as
                    possible and it seemed to me that maybe Spanish was the way to go. I looked
                    around the world and saw how many people spoke Spanish and Latin America was a
                    big place, there are a lot of posts there. So, I studied Spanish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you studied Spanish and you were assigned to Panama to
                        do what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, at that point they had something called central complement
                    assignments for young officers. We rotated through the embassy for six months,
                    four months in the economic section, four months in the political section, etc.
                    As I recall I started in the economic section. After I'd been in Panama for
                    about a year, the Department decided to close the one man, one person consulate
                    that we had in Colon on the other side of the isthmus. Our ambassador at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: A fellow named Joseph Farland who was a republican. He had been held
                    over by the Kennedy administration. He was a political appointee and he had made
                    it the opening of the consulate in Colon, the reopening of it when he had
                    arrived two years previously so that was his signature accomplishment in Panama.
                    He didn't want to close it and the Department said, well if you want to send
                    someone who is now assigned to Panama City to Colon to keep it open, that's
                    fine. He designated me to go to Colon and I went there as the principal
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Principal and only officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Principal and only officer. I was 23 years old.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, tell me just to quickly, you're there in Panama
                        rotating through the first year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any sense now of what the sort of major
                        issues were or what was confronting us in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well in Panama in the early 1960s there was only one issue and that was
                    the control of the Panama Canal Zone. In fact I went to Colon in July of, it
                    would have been 1963 and in January of 1964 there was an explosive series of
                    riots all along the Canal Zone in Colon and in Panama City. In Colon my first
                    wife and I were living above consular offices so when the mob marched on the
                    consulate they actually marched on us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How far was Colon from Panama City?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Colon was about an hour and a half by car, just across the Isthmus. You
                    could take at that point they had the still, they may still have the
                    Transcontinental Railway, which was the shortest Transcontinental Railway in the
                    world. You could drive back and forth in an hour and a half or so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the riots, did they just kind of bubble up naturally
                        or where did they suddenly come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, there was longstanding resentment on the part of the Panamanians
                    particularly the nationalists that the United States had basically taken the
                    Panama Canal Zone and built the canal and of course Teddy Roosevelt admitted
                    that he had taken the Panama Canal Zone to build the canal. So, it was a
                    question of wounded nationalism. Generations of Panamanian students had come
                    forward dedicated to the proposition of reasserting Panamanian sovereignty over
                    the Canal Zone and the particular spark for these riots was a demonstration by
                    American students in the Canal Zone. There had been an agreement I think in 1960
                    or '61 that the Panamanian flag would fly side by side with the American flag in
                    the Canal Zone. These American students at the Canal Zone high school sort of
                    had a fit of American nationalism and became upset with this and they sort of
                    marched on and lowered the Panamanian flag in the Canal Zone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What date would that approximately have been?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: That would have been early January of 1964 and the riots then took
                    place that day and the next day and for about a week following that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Colon then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: We were in Colon. The national guard, when the national guard which was
                    the national police force finally moved the mob back away from our building and
                    my wife and I and our small young son were trapped inside. They finally got the
                    mob dispersed. They were throwing stones through the windows and all of that. We
                    then after another harrowing series of moves within Colon were driven out of
                    Colon into the Canal Zone by the number two in the National Guard. He put us in
                    the back seat of the car and covered us with a blanket.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a Panamanian national?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: These were Panamanian national guards. They drove us across the line
                    into the Canal Zone. There was a lot of violence going on, sniping, and there
                    had been several deaths. It was not a pleasant time. We remained in the Canal
                    Zone for about a week. The rioting finally was quieted down. There was a sort of
                    truce established between Panama and the United States but they broke diplomatic
                    relations with us and we kept in our embassy in Panama City, we kept a very
                    small presence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Farland still there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, Farland was gone by that time. He had a charg� d'affaires, Wallace
                    Stuart. But Farland had resigned I think in late 1963. We needed people in
                    Panama City to man the embassy who had consular experience and because I had
                    been vice consul in Colon I had a consular commission so they sent me back from
                    Colon with my family back to Panama City. We actually lived in Panama City,
                    moved back into the same apartment we lived in before we went to Colon. There
                    were I think four or five of us there. Generally except for one person who was
                    in charge, he had been the chief of the political section. The rest of us were
                    all FSO-7s or 8s, junior officers. So, we lived in that kind of temporary
                    situation for almost six months and finally relations were reestablished and I
                    was assigned back to Washington where I became the political officer on the
                    Panama desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, did this series of riots lead the United States at
                        that time to begin seriously to contemplate any change in the situation
                        would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes and one of the agreements that we reached in order to heal this
                    breach and begin a process of normalizing relations was that we would look at
                    the possibility of renegotiating the treaty of 1903.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that the first time they had really said that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The first time they'd really addressed that issue. This was Lyndon
                    Johnson's first foreign policy act. In July of 1964 I was sent back, reassigned
                    to Washington and I went on to the desk and I became a small part of the general
                    effort to reexamine the agreement and try to begin the process of negotiating a
                    new treaty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a little bit, I'm interested in the story about
                        the students in the Zone and so forth. What was your sense, I mean I have
                        vague memories of the Zonians being the most intense people about
                        maintaining the status quo. Talk a little bit about your impressions of them
                        in general, would you? How many of them were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: There were several thousand families there. Many of them had been there
                    for two and three generations. They operated administered and maintained the
                    Canal, which at that point was a very important waterway. Many of them had
                    become very inward looking, very chauvinistic, did not like Panamanians, did not
                    like Panama. Many of them had lived in this ten mile wide strip of land for
                    nearly their whole lives and had never set foot in the Republic of Panama. They
                    were an extraordinarily inward looking lot and they recognized rightly as it
                    turned out that it was a zero sum game between them and the Panamanians.
                    Anything the U.S. gave up with regard to sovereignty over the Canal Zone was a
                    loss to them. They were American colonials. In fact they were in this little
                    American enclave, very well paid, lived very well, very generous fringe benefits
                    and they recognized that as the Panamanians took control of the Canal they would
                    lose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the administrative structure of the Canal Zone?
                        Was there a governor appointed by the president or how did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, there was a governor appointed by the president and we had our
                    U.S. unified military command was located there, SOUTHCOM. So, we had the CINC
                    who was a four star general and we had the Canal Zone governor and the two of
                    them administered the Canal Zone sort of jointly and the U.S. ambassador in
                    Panama City was the liaison or the link to the government of Panama. It was a
                    very complicated structure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it work well between the ambassador and the governor
                        in the CINC in general or what would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: My sense was that for the most part it was very dependent upon
                    personality. Of course I was a very green junior officer. I didn't have much of
                    an insight or look into the relationships at the top of the U.S. structure down
                    there. There was a certain amount of resentment on the part of the Americans in
                    the Canal Zone, resentment of Americans in the embassy because they didn't think
                    that we were necessarily representing their interests and in some ways they were
                    correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the military in those days, how did they react to the
                        idea that there might have to be changes in the setup? Did you have any feel
                        for that as early as the years you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, I think at that point there was not much speculation about changes
                    that would affect the status of the U.S. military, not nearly as much as there
                    was about changes that would affect the status of U.S. civilians in the Canal
                    Zone. The military, you remember this was just as we were sort of gearing up for
                    Vietnam. It was also just a couple of years after Castro had come to power in
                    Cuba. It was a good deal of concern about the influence of communism throughout
                    Latin America; the alliance for progress had been launched just a year before.
                    So, this was at that point, Latin America was on the frontier of the Cold War
                    and very much of a sense that we were in competition with forces that we really
                    didn't understand very well. We had just launched the Peace Corps. One of my
                    first jobs in the embassy in Panama as a very green officer was to negotiate an
                    agreement, which established the Peace Corps program in Panama City. Then I
                    toured around the country selecting sites for the first group of Peace Corps
                    volunteers. It was a great experience. That was kind of the spirit of the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did they want to have a post in Colon? What was its
                        justification?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: There was no real justification for it except that the second vice
                    president of Panama, Jose Dominador Bazan, was from Colon. He had lobbied the
                    newly arrived ambassador in 1960 or '61 to open the post, to reopen it or keep
                    it open, one or the other and the ambassador agreed and it did become sort of a
                    thing of honor or pride. There was no real justification for keeping it open. In
                    fact as it turned out during the riots, after the riots we closed it, never
                    again to reopen it because given the physical set up you were part of the
                    Republic which sort of jutted into the Canal Zone, you were really kind of a
                    staked goat over there with very little ability to provide for security. I was
                    there when Kennedy was assassinated for example and you can imagine what that
                    was like for a young FSO to suddenly become the American representative in a
                    fairly significant, fairly sizeable city when our president and a man whom
                    Panamanians of course regarded in some ways as their president was assassinated.
                    That was a kind of searing memory and experience that I will never really
                    forget.</p>

                        the windows, you weren't disillusioned about this business you were in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, I wasn't. I found it all kind of exciting, you know, and I guess I
                    was young enough not to really be convinced of my own mortality, although it was
                    also terrifying from time to time. But, no, I found that very, kind of an
                    exhilarating experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, from that, did you ask to go back to the desk or did

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They just sent me back. I don't know, we may have been going through
                    one of our periodic budget squeezes at that point. Anyway, I would have
                    preferred probably to go to another overseas post, but I had never served in the
                    Department and the powers that be thought it was time for me to go back and I
                    did. As it turned out it was a very good time and a very good assignment for me
                    because I was three years on the Panama desk at a time when we were going
                    through this intensive review of what we wanted to do with the Canal Zone. I had
                    a degree of exposure to senior policy makers and major policy issues that I
                    never would have had and most junior officers did not have.</p>

                        issue, which is the question of the canal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll come back to that, but were there other things that
                        as a desk officer you spent much time on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, although frankly they kind of pale in my memory in comparison with
                    the issue of the Canal Zone. Sure, I got involved in some multilateral questions
                    that we wanted Panama's vote on. I got very involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: In the UN. I got very involved in some of the internal political issues
                    that had direct and indirect implications for the question of the Canal Zone and
                    its status. I became; I was sort of seized with the notion of knowing more about
                    Panama, its history and its current condition than anyone else in the U.S.
                    government. So, I used to work at this pretty hard and I think probably did make
                    that, achieve that position in terms of its internal politics, its economy which
                    was fairly small and insignificant. Its history, its background. It's a strange
                    little country because it is really very much an artificial relation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. How did the government set itself up then to deal
                        with this problem with the Canal? What kind of structure did it have to work
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. President Johnson appointed as a special representative a fellow
                    named Robert Anderson who had been secretary of the treasury and was an old
                    Johnson crony.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not a Latin American expert?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Not a Latin American expert, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Johnson presumably picked him because he was somebody he
                        trusted and knew?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes and someone who had political leverage and experience at the senior
                    levels. His deputy, who in fact took on most of the work, was a fellow named
                    Jack Irwin who later became deputy secretary of the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Irwin a career diplomat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No. He was then the general counsel of IBM. He had married Tom Watson,
                    Sr.'s daughter and still was married to her.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he get picked for this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Anderson knew him and Anderson wanted someone he could trust and these
                    guys were both republicans, they were not democrats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Johnson have that in mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, I think Johnson was trying to protect his right flank by bringing
                    in people to work on this issue. It was as you can remember very controversial
                    and we knew we would have to give up a good deal of what we then had in order to
                    mollify the Panamanians and have any hope of a stable long lasting relationship.
                    So, I think Johnson was trying to cover his right flank most definitely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This began, this effort began, when did those guys come on
                        the scene?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They came on the scene in 1964, just about the time I came back to the
                    desk. There had been a four or five month period in which the U.S. government
                    was kind of gearing up for this. The fellow who had been political counselor
                    when I first arrived in Panama City went on to be DCM I think in Ecuador or
                    Lima, one of the two and came back as the country director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: A fellow named Ed Clark, Edward W. Clark and he was country director
                    for Panama. Panama had its own office. It was not part of the office of Central
                    American Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that, because of the Canal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Because of the Canal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It had high visibility?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Oh, very high visibility. At that point in Latin America we had back to
                    back positioning of State and AID so there was, the deputy director of the
                    office was an AID officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was an unusual arrangement, only in Latin America I
                        think did they do that, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes and it worked quite well actually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much interaction with Anderson and
                        Irwin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I was a brash young FSO who developed a knack for writing about these
                    issues fairly quickly so I was frequently the pen for a lot of the things that
                    they were doing. It was a time when I learned a lot about how to succeed in a
                    bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you succeed in a bureaucracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, I think first of all you have to be relentless and tireless, but
                    also it's very important to have a degree of control or at least influence over
                    what it is that everybody is looking at. So, whoever has the task of preparing
                    the first draft generally has an ability to remain engaged in the issue over a
                    protracted period of time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though you don't necessarily go to the principles
                        meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: You don't go to all of the principles meetings, no. I was an FSO-7,
                    subsequently an FSO-6, so I didn't go over to the NSC for meetings there. I
                    didn't really usually even sit in on the meetings with the assistant secretary,
                    but I was producing the papers that went up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even at this point instead of saying we're really going to
                        be hard nosed and just blow the Panamanians off, they really had decided
                        that they had to make a deal with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it inevitable or do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Oh, I think it was pretty much inevitable. I mean it was an issue not
                    just in Panama as an issue, but colored our relationships with all of Latin
                    America. This was a time of rising nationalism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the U.S. hearing from a lot of other Latins?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. It was a big issue in the OAS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Organization of American States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right and you know, our position on that could not stand in total
                    contradiction with what we were trying to do in the alliance for progress. Again
                    you have to look at all these issues in the context of the Cold War. I think we
                    were wise enough to recognize that had we held to a kind of ultra nationalist
                    position with regard to the future of the Panama Canal and the Canal Zone, that
                    it would have cost us very substantially in terms of public opinions throughout
                    Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the sense working on the desk in this issue
                        that the Pentagon was of this view as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Some were in the Pentagon, but it was a very difficult issue for them.
                    It struck at the question of the future of U.S. military presence in Latin
                    America. The Canal itself, which was something that strategically, the Pentagon
                    viewed as very important. It was a congressional act I believe which set up a
                    commission to study the future of the Panama Canal and possible alternatives to
                    it. The Panama Canal Authority, I can't remember the full name, but I was
                    involved in the staffing of that as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you deal with congress at all during this period to
                        get their sense?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Not too directly. I dealt with some congressional staffers, but again
                    when people had to go up and testify on Panama I would frequently participate in
                    drafting the testimony, but I didn't go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your sense of congress at this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: There was strong opposition within the congress to the things that we
                    eventually ended up doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that because they were hearing from their
                        constituents?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They were hearing from their constituents. This was an issue unlike
                    most others in terms of its ability to draw out very strong feelings for the
                    American public. People who otherwise cared almost nothing about foreign policy
                    cared a lot about the Canal Zone because they had learned in school that Teddy
                    Roosevelt took the Canal, the Canal Zone and we built the Panama Canal. It was a
                    symbol of great national pride.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an effort being made at this period to try to
                        educate congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, there was, but.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean privately, let me put it this way, privately did
                        you get the sense of great opposition apart from what they said publicly or
                        were they more, how would you characterize it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Privately and publicly they were pretty opposed. You know, Johnson
                    given his links to the conservative side of the Democratic Party was able to
                    hold some of them in check, but it was not an easy proposition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were there for three years specializing in this
                        and you said you did some amount of multilateral stuff in terms of, you were
                        always around trying to round up votes in the UN on various issues I
                        suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Exactly, but that was not a very significant part of what I was doing.
                    I was very focused on Panama, the bilateral relationship, the future of the
                    Canal and the bureaucratic struggles within the U.S. government to try to find a
                    reasonable negotiation position. Then the negotiations actually began with the
                    Panamanians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About when was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They began I think in 1965 and they continued, they were still going on
                    after I left in '67 and then that agreement fell apart because of a coup in
                    Panama. They went through a retracted period of instability and it wasn't until
                    the mid-'70s that the efforts to renegotiate the Canal Treaty resumed and
                    produced a new treaty finally during the Carter administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a sense of from what you know looking back
                        now were the main parameters in place by '67?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think so.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had they faced up to that they were really going to hand
                        this back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think that we had faced up to that very early on, but the notion that
                    we could act as though we were sovereign which is what the original treaty said
                    in a piece of land which was obviously not American, that we had somehow taken
                    that and expropriated, that notion was not durable. We had to figure out a way
                    to get what we wanted, what we thought we needed which was in the end it was an
                    extended period of transition from '78 until '99.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, in 1967 you finished three years on the desk with an
                        extensive involvement with Panama. Had you worked your Spanish up pretty
                        well by the time you were finished with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It was fair. In Panama it was very difficult to acquire a great fluency
                    in Spanish because everybody spoke English. As soon as they saw me they were
                    tempted to believe I was not a Panamanian so everybody would speak to me in
                    English. It was very hard to practice Spanish, but I had gotten a 3 at the end
                    of my FSI course so I was off language probation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '67, what ever happens to you then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, while I was in the Department I had also gone to George
                    Washington at night and studied economics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Graduate economics. Because I was intrigued by the notion as I'd
                    learned a little bit about Panama, I was intrigued by the extent to which
                    economics and politics were interrelated. The alliance for progress was all
                    about economic development. While I was in Panama I had actually taught a course
                    for a fellow who was an Egyptian who was there with the UN. He was teaching a
                    course and he had been gone for a week so I filled in for him on theories of
                    economic development, which I had taken a course in at Dartmouth as an
                    undergraduate. I decided I wanted to learn more economics and a woman, female
                    Foreign Service Officer who was also on the desk, was a good friend of mine of
                    our family. She had studied economics in graduate school and encouraged me to go
                    to George Washington night school, so I did.Q: Was there an economic specialty
                    type or cone type thing at that point in the Department?</p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were people called economic officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: There were economic officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the middle '60s then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you went and studied yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right. I took I guess five or six courses in economics. It was very
                    important to me throughout my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Department did not pay for any of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They paid the tuition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, they did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that's a good thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I had to summon up the energy to do it two nights a week, but they paid
                    the tuition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you had taken the economics courses and had worked on
                        Panama and so what comes up in the summer of 1967?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I was assigned to Madrid, Spain as an economic officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At your request?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: At my request.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. In those days did they have an open bidding system
                        by then that you could?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. It was a long time ago, I'm trying to remember, but yes I think
                    they did. You did a sort of a preference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You wanted to go to Madrid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I wanted to go to another Spanish speaking post, the notion of going to
                    Europe was appealing to me and I wanted something that would solidify what I had
                    been studying in the area of economics. I went off to Madrid as the number two
                    economic officer in a small two person unit and focused on the internal and
                    external economic relations with Spain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big was the overall economic section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The overall economic section then was probably eight to ten officers, a
                    fairly significant commercial office, there was a counselor, there was one or
                    two people who did civil aviation and that sort of stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The ambassador at the outset when I first arrived was Angier Biddle
                    Duke and he was followed by Robert Wagner who was the former mayor of New
                    York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Duke was also a political appointee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Duke was a political appointee, Wagner was a political appointee and
                    then when Nixon was elected in '68 Wagner left and a fellow named Robert Hill
                    arrived as ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he also a political appointee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: He was also a political appointee. The reality is I never worked for a
                    career ambassador in all of my posts.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting. So, you get to Spain and what were the
                        prime issues that you dealt with yourself would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The major issue was whether or not Spain's by that time remarkable
                    economic progress would continue and importantly the nature and content of
                    Spain's relationship with the what was then the European Community. Spain had
                    decided in the mid '60s basically it was going to orient itself toward Europe.
                    After a long period of alienation following the civil war. They were engaged in
                    an effort to negotiate an affiliation agreement with the EU, with the EC and
                    that was of course of great interest to the U.S. both economically in terms of
                    trade policy, but also political because even then there were people who thought
                    that Spain should be brought somehow into NATO. There was a feeling that if you
                    could build economic connections between Spain and Europe that that could make
                    the process of NATO entry easier. Spain of course at that point was still
                    governed by Francisco Franco. It was without question a dictatorship. It was not
                    by that time a very bloody dictatorship and you could live there as a foreigner
                    without being conscious every hour or every day that you were living in a
                    dictatorship. Without question he was an authoritarian, the country was still
                    badly fractured ideologically and socially by the outcome of the civil war. Many
                    Spaniards have not forgiven the other side and Franco was there in a way that
                    maintained political stability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: the U.S. interests then would you say that the prime
                        interest was for the U.S. was the NATO military base structure in Spain and
                        the GATT?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, our principle interest was a complex of military bases. We had the
                    naval base, the submarine base at Rota it was very important because it was an
                    essential station for our submarine patrols throughout the Mediterranean. Given
                    our competition with the Soviet Union and the state of our submarine technology
                    at that point we had to be able to put submarines into the Eastern Mediterranean
                    as part of our strategic doctrine. We also had the air base of Torrejon, which
                    was very important to us, because again they back up what we were doing in our
                    presence in Germany and France. We had substantial numbers of American forces
                    where they were not as visible as they might have been, but they were there and
                    the Spaniards knew about them. Our presence really was a mark of legitimacy for
                    the Franco regime without question. As in other places around the world at that
                    time those who were opposed to Franco tended to be very suspicious of the United
                    States because they saw us as providing legitimacy for his continued rule.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many years were you in Madrid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I was there four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '67 to '71.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: '67 to '71.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You focused all that time on these particular issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I focused on the economic side. It was a strange time in Spain because
                    a lot of people who under a more liberal system of government would have been in
                    politics, particularly in a moderate opposition, didn't see much prospect of
                    affecting the future that way. So, many of them became economists, many of them
                    went into the government on sort of the technical side where it wasn't all that
                    technical. They were making an influence on decisions which had a fundamental
                    impact on Spain in which, for example, opening up the economy of promoting
                    Spain's closer association with the rest of Europe had very substantial
                    political effects over time. The embassy, particularly under Hill, we had the
                    rather strange notion as a country at that point that because we had strong ties
                    to Franco and he was our sort of anchor point in Spain that we should not be
                    dealing with anyone who could be said to be in the opposition. So, Hill
                    particularly was very adamant that no officers in the embassy should be talking
                    to people who were in the political opposition not that there was all that much
                    of an open opposition. There was still the communist party in Spain of
                    substantial strength. They were working in economic ministries. There was the
                    Bank of Spain, Banco de Espana. So, these were all people who were legitimate
                    contacts for me, but who were actually oppositionists and through them I would
                    meet other people. I would write these memoranda of conversation, which at that
                    point in the State Department's affairs was a fairly common way of conveying
                    information. Now of course it's all done on e-mail. The people in Washington
                    were fascinated by all this stuff that I was giving them. I had lunch a few
                    times with Felipe Gonzalez when he was still a sort of renegade professor at one
                    of the universities there long before he became Prime Minister of Spain. Hill
                    never quite understood there could be anything in the area of economics that
                    would have any relevance to what was happening politically in Spain. So, I had a
                    good deal of flexibility, which was not enjoyed by all the other officers in the
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Hill like as a manager would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I found him very authoritarian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: He came from the Boston area. I think he worked for the United Fruit
                    Company at one point. He had been an ambassador. I used to refer to him as a
                    career Republican ambassador. He'd served in El Salvador and in Mexico as
                    ambassador and from Spain he eventually went on and was ambassador in Argentina
                    in the Ford administration I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically did he sort of see himself as the chief
                        political officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: He was the chief of everything. He did not delegate with great ease. He
                    was very committed to the notion that we had to remain glued to Francisco Franco
                    forever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that because the Department told him that or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It was a view in Washington in some ways in the wealthy American
                    establishment at that point. Remember, again, this was the Cold War. There was a
                    feeling that our friends were our friends and we should support them. There was
                    no clearly identifiable democratic alternative at that point in Spain. There was
                    a great deal of concern that should something happen to Franco or should he be
                    politically weakened that Spain could find itself in a kind of domestic chaos
                    that it had experienced in the '30s. Of course we didn't want to see that
                    happen. Spain was important for the stability of Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an everlasting question isn't it? I'm sure you
                        encountered it later and we can talk about the issue of supporting the
                        people and the status quo or trying to push against it especially if the
                        status quo is nondemocratic. So, that's an old, very difficult and certainly
                        very common issue of our history of our relations with Latin America.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It is in Latin America and many other places. At one point I told
                    people and friends that I specialized in countries which were governed by aging
                    autocrats, I was in Spain in those years and then years later I was in Tunisia.
                    Then of course in the '80s in the Philippines with Ferdinand Marcos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you met people like Gonzalez in Spain and wrote a
                        memorandum of conversation about them. Did you show them to Hill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They just went out as normal embassy communications and they did not
                    rise to the level of his attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which meant he didn't try to stifle your contacts.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: He didn't try to stifle my contacts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you also did I suppose regular reporting on these
                        economic issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, but at that point we used to write something which was sort of
                    like an economic quarterly looking at current trends and projections in the
                    Spanish economy. That was used by the analytical community all throughout
                    Washington and it was also consumed by American businesses, banks, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you say the analytical community back in
                        Washington, who would that be would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, it would be the Treasury Department. There was no treasury
                    attache. The analytical side of Commerce, we had commercial officers in Spain,
                    but they were generally in the trade promotion. They would also be in the
                    agency, in DIA and throughout the U.S. government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, now Madrid is a big post and you were
                        still a pretty junior officer coming from Panama, so how did you find the
                        living in those days in the sense of the embassy community or whatever?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Actually it was good. I had some trouble from time to time with Hill in
                    my last two years I was there. After the first year there was a cost reduction
                    exercise in the State Department. Fortunately for me the position of my then
                    boss, the number one person in this two person office was eliminated and so I
                    became the sole occupant of this series of this little unit and reported
                    directly to the economic counselor. After that my life got a lot better. It was
                    good living in Spain in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a sense of community?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: There was a pretty good sense of community, yes. There was an expat
                    business community in Spain. There were other embassies there of course. At the
                    time I made several friends some of whom I still see from the British embassy, a
                    fellow who then worked for the economic intelligence unit in Spain and various
                    other people that my first wife and I tended to socialize with. I was fortunate
                    in that I was able to travel throughout Spain. My Spanish was by that time good
                    enough so that I could go to Spanish universities and give lectures. I was
                    generally welcomed at universities. It was not, the anti-Americanism was not at
                    a fever pitch by any means. I would develop talks on various books. I remember
                    doing a talk that I probably did 12 times on one of John Galbraith's books. I
                    used those as ways to educate people about American culture, the American
                    economy, etc. Anyway, I got to travel all over Spain. I loved the country. I
                    still do. Probably in terms of personal comfort and enjoyment, probably the
                    highlight of all the places that I've lived in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, in talking to people like Gonzalez, did you get a
                        sense at that time that there was some reasonable prospect down the road
                        that there were sensible people thinking about serious questions. You were
                        writing these up and sending them back and people were quite interested in
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: People were very interested. I would get notes from people asking if I
                    could develop more information on this particular question. Yes, I had the sense
                    that clearly Spain was not frozen in amber. Franco by this time was aging. On
                    the economic side liberalization was well underway. State control which had been
                    the governing philosophy of economic management there since the mid '30s was
                    rapidly being dismantled. Spain was lowering its barriers to imports encouraging
                    foreign investment. There was a group of people within Spain who were in the
                    process of acquiring very substantial influence; that was the Opus Dei. They
                    basically ran the economic side of the government. The minister of planning was
                    an Opus Dei member. The vice president was too. The minister of foreign affairs.
                    So, these guys were all dedicated to the prospect of changing Spain
                    economically. They were not all that eager to see change in the political skew,
                    but that did come.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Franco in accord with that approach?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think so, yes. I mean one of the interesting things is nobody has
                    ever, at least I'm not familiar with it, it's been written sort of obliquely,
                    look at Franco's thinking in those years, what he was really trying to do other
                    than just survive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it going on in a sense in spite of him, that he didn't
                        pay any attention?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, I think to some extent it was going on in spite of him, but he
                    did one very significant thing at that time. He brought Juan Carlos as the
                    Prince in Waiting so that when Franco died Juan Carlos became king. At the time
                    nobody was very impressed with that because it seemed kind of an archaic move
                    that you would bring back a monarch. Juan Carlos went through a training period
                    where he was farmed out to individual ministries for a few months at a time.
                    Generally the people that he worked with or was associated with there had tended
                    to conclude that he wasn't very bright. So, there was a good deal of surprise
                    when after he became king and after Franco was gone he became basically the
                    pillar of stability. I think probably he deserves an enormous credit for how
                    Spain has evolved since 1975 and Franco should have some credit for having put
                    him there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were there four years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And basically had the same position all the way through
                        except that you got to be in charge of much of your own unit at one
                        point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you spent four years in Spain and then what did you
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Then I wanted another language and I had met some people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You wanted that because you thought that was important to
                        you career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I thought it was important to my career. By this time I was kind of
                    turned on to what was happening in Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The European Union, European Community, Transatlantic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see yourself then committed to being an economic
                        specialist primarily?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Primarily. I mean I had done something that most Foreign Service
                    Officers though was a little loony and that was that I transferred out of the
                    political cone into the economic cone which of course was kind of
                    counterintuitive at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Maybe even now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Maybe even now. I was convinced and I think I was right that overseas
                    the more interesting jobs where you could do more, you had more autonomy, more
                    independence were generally speaking on the economic side. I would look at my
                    colleagues at my rank in the political section in Madrid, which was a
                    substantial section, and they were all doing things, which by and large I didn't
                    find very interesting. They had been given an assigned political, slice of the
                    political spectrum or a number of units that they could work on. I felt I had
                    sort of unlimited scope to do almost anything I wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In effect you were doing a sort of political reporting as
                        you've explained on the side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, I would describe most Foreign Service economic work as political
                    economist. It's not, for the most part, strictly speaking, is not really
                    economic at all, it's some of that, but not very much. In the larger posts of
                    course that's done by the treasury attache, so State Department people are
                    basically doing political economy. I'd met a fellow who was then an economic
                    minister in Paris and I decided I'd like to go to Paris so I applied for a job
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: A fellow named Bob Brand who later went on and he was the ambassador to
                    Australia. He's had a long and pretty good career. I wanted to study French. I
                    thought French would be useful to me. I went back to Washington for four
                    months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the summer of '71?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: In the summer of '71. I actually left Madrid in April or May. My family
                    then followed when school was over. I was in Washington for four months studying
                    French and found that speaking Spanish was quite an aid to me because I was able
                    to get it. Actually it was only three months and I got a 3/3 in French after
                    three months. Then we went to Paris where I was again in a sort of internal
                    political unit or economic unit rather, focused on what was happening
                    domestically, but more focused on what was happening within the European Union
                    and the European Community. That was a good place to be.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many years were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I was only there for two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '71 to '73?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: '71 to '73.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you say were the, tell me a little more of the
                        substance of the issues that you worked on there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: These were largely issues having to do with U.S. concerns over the EU's
                    or EC's negotiation of the affiliation agreements, association agreements with a
                    large number of countries in North Africa, Central Europe which we felt were
                    trade discriminatory toward the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Because they created preferences within the trading block and we were
                    not benefiting from those preferences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Give me an example of one of those, if you can
                        recall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The preferences flowed in both directions. The Europeans would give
                    preferences to North Africans for citrus, which would have the affect of
                    damaging the interest of citrus exporters in the Caribbean or in the U.S. In
                    return they would have preferences for sales of manufactured goods under those
                    countries. We were somewhat conflicted on this because on the one hand we
                    supported as a matter of principle the integration of Europe and there were
                    those who thought that Europe would constitute a point of stability in the
                    world, again in the Cold War world. Our trading interests were somewhat
                    divergent from that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you advocate for things as an economic officer or just
                        report or both?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I was doing more advocating than, it was a lot of reporting, but I was
                    presenting under instruction demarches to the foreign ministry on various
                    subjects having to do with these trading arrangements.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the French government or multilaterally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: We'd go to the French government. We had a mission of course in
                    Brussels, which was dealing with the European community as an entity, but we
                    were in all of the major European capitals also dealing simultaneously with the
                    governments and I think probably to a degree much greater than is now done. My
                    sense is that we now deal with Europe pretty exclusively on economic and trade
                    issues through Brussels, not through individual national capitals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the French on these
                        matters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Challenging. I decided it was a little bit like Sinatra's song about
                    New York. I mean if you can make it in Paris as a U.S. diplomat, you could
                    probably make it just about anyplace because these were not easy times. It
                    hadn't been that long since the French had pulled out of NATO. De Gaulle had
                    died, but it wasn't going to be a lot easier. It was a difficult time. We were
                    taking over or had taken over from them in Vietnam. We were going through, let's
                    see, we were going through the first stages of disengaging from the gold
                    exchange standard, so we were in confrontation with them over certain aspects of
                    our monetary policy. It was not, not an easy time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One issue for example was citrus. Are there any others
                        that particularly strike you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Not that I can recall offhand, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was the general subject of preferences.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It was the general subject. That's right. The extent to which we were
                    disadvantaged by these association arrangements which on the whole we favored
                    for political reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For political reasons, the theory being that having a
                        unified European community would ultimately result in more stability than
                        otherwise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now did you get a lot of pressure from interest groups in
                        the United States on various matters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Sure. I was not getting it directly. It was all coming through the
                    State Department, but yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People lobby in effect and in the sense that I guess
                        they're entitled to, obviously, make their views known.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Sure. Yes. Then in the second year I was there. It would have been the
                    second year, again in this small unit, there were four of us in the unit and the
                    chief of the unit was transferred and there was no assigned replacement
                    immediately. So, I was made acting chief and hoped, actually very much
                    encouraged to hope that I would become permanent in that position. I was under
                    grade for the position and in the end the Department put somebody into the job
                    after I'd been doing it for about eight months. At the same time I had also been
                    given a couple of other temporary assignments prior to the economic minister. I
                    was handling civil aviation among other things. I had a very full portfolio and
                    I was very engaged. I got kind of disenchanted with the State Department or the
                    Foreign Service at this juncture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Because they wouldn't leave me in the job that I knew I could do and
                    was doing well. I had to go back to being the number two and of course not, I
                    suppose I might not have dealt with it in the maturest manner possible. I
                    decided that with some encouragement actually, I decided to try to get an
                    assignment for a year outside the State Department. I was encouraged to apply
                    for something called the White House Exchange Program, the Executive Exchange
                    Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Encouraged by?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Encouraged by people within the embassy, by people in Washington. I
                    think it was a good thing for me to have done. I went off by myself for two
                    weeks and traveled around the U.S. interviewing with private companies for jobs
                    with this White House Exchange Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. So, it wasn't an exchange program that put you in
                        the White House? It was, I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, no. It was under White House auspices and it worked in both
                    directions. People in the private sector came into government; people from
                    government went into the private sector.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I ultimately ended up working for a bank in Chicago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What bank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Continental Illinois, which no longer exists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do for them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I worked in their international department basically doing sort of
                    economic analysis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Department was paying you salary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The Department was paying my salary, but the bank was sort of
                    committing to use me and we lived in Chicago on the outskirts of Chicago, way on
                    the outskirts. It sort of gave me a time to draw a breath and decide what I
                    wanted to do. The bank wanted me to stay in the end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They offered you a job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They offered me a job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you have done for them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, for them I would have become their number two working on Latin
                    America and basically they had a fairly extensive operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, they did?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: A number of branches down there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went and you did various kinds of economic analyses
                        for them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stuff that you had learned to do through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes and I also learned a lot when I was there. They sent me also for
                    example; they sent me back to Spain to do a study for them of where they should
                    be strategically in Spain. This was 1974 and it was already clear Franco was not
                    long for this world and they were trying to figure out what they should do in
                    Spain, what was likely to happen there when Franco went. So, I did that for them
                    and they were prepared to send me to graduate school. They thought it would be
                    useful, in fact important, for me to get an MBA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would they have employed you at a higher salary than you
                        were making?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, significantly higher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why didn't you do it? You fool.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I know. Well, it's funny how these things work out. I went to
                    Washington on business for the bank and went by to see a fellow that I had
                    worked with in the embassy in Paris. He saw me and said Julius Katz wanted to
                    see me. I don't know if you ever knew Julius? He was a real institution in the
                    bureau of economic affairs. So, I went up and met with Julius and this was just
                    after the energy crisis, the Middle East crisis in the fall of '73. Julius was
                    trying to figure out how to cope with all of this. He wanted someone to come in
                    and run a small unit in the bureau, which would deal with the
                    multilateralization of this energy crisis. I finally decided that the State
                    Department, I had enjoyed it by and large. I wasn't confident I would enjoy
                    being a banker as much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would have had to return to the Middle West.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: That's right. That may have been a factor actually in my thinking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, to be chronologically, you left Paris in the summer of
                        '73?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I left Paris in the summer of '73.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did a year with the bank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, I actually did eight months with the bank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, so by the.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: By April of '74.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were ready to go into.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I left the bank and went back to Washington and went into the bureau of
                    economic affairs and within two months of my having done that I was made
                    director of fuels and energy in the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is working for Mr. Katz and you said he was a legend.
                        Talk about him a little bit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, he probably had as much influence on my career as anybody I've
                    worked with. He was not a Foreign Service Officer. He was a long time civil
                    service employee, but he had worked on international economic issues for
                    basically his whole career particularly on commodities and energy policy and
                    trade. He eventually left government and went to work in the private sector for
                    a few years and then he came back in the first Bush administration. He was
                    deputy special trade representative. He was very kind of crusty, very smart, and
                    very determined. I again learned a lot from him about how to operate in a
                    bureaucratic environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he the assistant secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: When I first went back he was the principal deputy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is in the Bureau of Economic Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Bureau of Economic Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. He was the principal deputy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you report to him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I reported to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On this fuels and energy office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Fuels and energy and then after I'd been there just a few months, Tom
                    Enders came back as assistant secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, we have to talk about him, too. So, was Katz, I mean,
                        he was extremely smart you said.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Very smart, very decent man, the good despite his crustiness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and a good bureaucratic operator.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Good bureaucrat. Very high standards. Demanded a lot. He was testing
                    you all the time. These were very rewarding, but very intense times that I was
                    there. The energy crisis was a great political issue domestically, as well as a
                    real economic threat to the country. I got very involved both in international
                    energy issues, but also because of that quite involved in domestic energy
                    issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you trying to do, what was EB trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The first thing that we did was, Kissinger had convened a group of
                    Europeans and the Japanese to discuss multilateral cooperation in response to
                    the embargo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It meant that within 19, let's see it would have been 1974 that we
                    began to set up a new international agency which we attached to the OECD, but
                    was the international energy agency. I turned out to be the principal U.S.
                    negotiator of the agreements that set that up.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that going to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: That was going to do a number of things. First of all it was going to
                    set up a mechanism for sharing of oil supplies in an emergency. What had
                    happened in the embargo of course was that as oil supplies tightened
                    temporarily, there was tremendous battling within the Western world to try to
                    lock on to available supplies of oil. Those battles began to have very
                    significant political implications. Kissinger in particular was very disturbed
                    by this. He was trying to do things in the Middle East that would require this
                    accord of the Western Europeans. The Western Europeans were feuding with us
                    because they felt that the international oil companies most of whom were U.S.
                    controlled were giving preferential treatment to the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, I don't think they really were, but there was no transparency. In a
                    world in which transparency was beginning to become so important, we needed a
                    mechanism that we could provide for that transparency. We negotiated a fairly
                    elegant, but somewhat complicated system of sharing oil in an emergency which
                    was tied to commitments to maintain stocks of oil and to share it so that we
                    would maintain an agreed level of consumption among all countries so that we
                    were basically sharing the pain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that go into effect or has it ever actually been
                        done?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It's never actually been implemented, but the agreement remains and the
                    agency which then became the place where the industrialized countries
                    coordinated energy policy became an adjunct to the OECD with its own separate
                    government structure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it still there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It's still there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that one of the reasons that the U.S. set up its own
                        petroleum reserves, did it come out of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. It came out of that. I think hopefully we would have done it
                    anyway, but that was something that we were permitted to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you set up this agency and that presumably I can
                        imagine was a long Herculean task?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What else were you up to? You said you had a lot of.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Trying to work with what was first, then the Federal Energy Agency and
                    tried to get useful, meaningful U.S. energy legislation in place. One of the
                    things that was bedeviling us is that when it was that the embargo took place
                    and oil prices spiked the U.S., in contrast to most other industrialized
                    countries, decided for political reasons not to pass that price increase through
                    into the economy. We imposed oil price controls. We also had the additional
                    complication that we were not only an importer of oil we were a producer of oil.
                    There was no desire to allow domestic oil producers to gain what were viewed as
                    windfall rents from the sudden increase in the world price. So, domestic oil
                    prices were capped and you had a very complicated system for creating blended
                    prices between imports and domestic production.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a foreign affairs agency, how did you play into that as
                        a domestic question because you had to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Largely because we believed, we being in this case Kissinger, but
                    largely Enders and myself and Julius Katz that our international priorities were
                    jeopardized by not having a coherent credible domestic energy program. That if
                    we wanted to provide leadership on this issue we had to show that we were
                    prepared to lead in fact, not just in theory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the State Department, I mean as much as it was able
                        to, push for these price controls and so forth within the United
                        States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No. No, we pushed for the end of those price controls. We wanted the
                    effect of the oil price increase to be passed into the economy, work through the
                    economy as rapidly as possible which is what most other countries had done. As a
                    result other countries came out of that. They overcame those economic
                    consequences much more rapidly than we did. In fact I've always, I've never seen
                    any great analytical work on this, but I think what happened to us later
                    throughout the '70s and even in the early '80s in terms of inflation and
                    stagflation was due in very large measure to our unwillingness to take the
                    economic hit from that recent oil crisis.</p>

                <p>BOSWORTH: He wasn't interested in economic issues, per se, in fact, I used to sit
                    in on meetings with him and do the notes. I've heard him say a couple of times,
                    stop talking to me about millions of barrels of oil per day, I wouldn't
                    recognize an oil barrel if it walked into my office. He understood very well the
                    political implications of these issues, both the oil question as well as the
                    financial repercussions of the oil question. How do you recycle all of those
                    monies that were suddenly flowing into producers' coffers? Because if you didn't
                    recycle them fairly efficiently, you were going to add to deflation or other
                    economic pressures around the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say he was a fearsome character, what does that
                        mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: He was very demanding. He was, I've gotten to know Kissinger very well
                    in years since and I've told him. He kind of takes pride in the fact that people
                    were afraid of him. To deal with him effectively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He threw tantrums.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: He would throw tantrums. He would throw papers. He was admittedly under
                    some stress to say the least. This was as Watergate was unfolding and he was not
                    at all confident he had a president in place that he could count on. Then after
                    Watergate he was dealing with a new president, Ford, that he didn't know and
                    people were then in that administration were clearly determined to clip his
                    wings. This was a time of some tension for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think he's brilliant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think he's brilliant. Yes, he's not an ideal personality, but he is
                    brilliant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He did as you say, he took a great interest at least
                        certainly in this economic issue.BOSWORTH: yes, without question.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say that he really set a good deal of policy or
                        did he, did it come up from people like Katz and Enders and that they really
                        worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: On the oil side, I think that the Bureau of Economic affairs really put
                    together this strategy for dealing with all petroleum and financial implications
                    of the oil crisis. He believed in it and he was very instrumental in selling it
                    both to the U.S. government and selling it to foreign governments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was he really selling to foreign governments, the
                        idea that you had to be prepared to share and to cooperate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: To share and the notion that we had, we described at the time a shared
                    vulnerability. There were unilateral solutions possible for the U.S. to our oil
                    dependency, but it was the vulnerability of our major alliance partners that
                    really was the greatest threat to us. There were times in '74 and '75 when the
                    tensions between the Americans and the Europeans became such that one had
                    serious qualms about the fate of the impact on all of that on NATO and our
                    ability to maintain the strong containment position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Department through its economic people push I
                        would think they would on the Arab states and others in OPEC to 1) to get
                        off the embargo and 2) to work out the mechanism for the recycling of
                        petrodollars?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. In the end the recycling of petrodollars proved to be something
                    the market could handle fairly well because as we've learned, the marginal
                    propensity to consume by the oil producers proved to be almost infinite. So,
                    they did not simply hoard these reserves, they came back into the international
                    system and they were spent. Having put together consumer cooperation through the
                    International Energy Agency, known as the IEA, and this oil sharing plan and
                    various other elements of cooperation it was clear that we needed a dimension
                    that related us to the producers. So, we then found ourselves to some extent
                    responding to French leadership, participating in something called the
                    Conference on Economic Cooperation or CEC, which was centered in Paris, began in
                    '75 and extended through '77. That brought us together face to face with the
                    developing world led in many ways by the oil producers. The chairman of the
                    developing group was from Venezuela. The Saudis were there, the Iranians were
                    there, the Indonesians were there. On the industrialized countries side it was
                    basically the U.S., Japan and the EU.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: With great difficulty, but it worked. I was the principle U.S.
                    representative at that and it took enormous energies with relatively little gain
                    in fact, just to hold things together. It was important in maintaining allied
                    Western solidarity because there were countries within the Western alliance who
                    were very committed to the notion that somehow developing better relations with
                    the producers and believed that the U.S. was not. So, we had to demonstrate that
                    we were ready to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was your first serious interaction with the Arab
                        states I take?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Personally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you make of that? That was an experience with
                        dealing with this big question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It was a great introduction for me in many ways to multilateral
                    diplomacy with non-Western participation. It was very difficult. They were
                    intensely suspicious of us. They saw what had happened to oil as perhaps an
                    indication of what they could do with regard to other commodities as well as a
                    way to get some degree of market power, which translated into political power.
                    It was a way to lean on the West to try to get more concessional aid, more
                    preferential access to markets, more redeployment of industry, etc. This was the
                    height of the activity of the group of '77, the new international economic
                    order, all of which basically was sparked by the oil phenomena of 1973 and
                    '74.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It in effect represented an attempt to really reorganize
                        the economic terms of the world one might say to put it in a very
                        large.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, and not just in economic terms. It was an effort basically of
                    rebalanced power in the world. In retrospect it was really kind of doomed from
                    the beginning because first as it turned out the markets were much more powerful
                    than political agreements could have been. So, markets eventually caused a
                    rebalancing, but not with great rebalancing of political influence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You worked for Katz and you worked for Enders. Talk about
                        Enders a little bit.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Tom was I think unique in my experience in the State Department. No one
                    else really comes close to him in terms of intellectual reach and determination
                    and stamina. The only other person I can think of who might come under that same
                    level is somebody like Tom Pickering, to some extent Larry Eagleburger. Tom also
                    did not suffer fools gladly. He was very, very haughty, as only somebody 6'8”
                    can be. A true product of the American white shoe establishment. Number one in
                    his class at Yale. Just a brilliant mind, a little short on what one might call
                    people skills.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did somebody like that go into the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I asked him that once and he said because he was too tall to be a
                    military officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not funny.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Then of course after he retired from the Foreign Service, he went on to
                    quite a successful career in investment banking. Tom was one of these people
                    like many of us who is drawn to issues of public policy and who want to find
                    themselves in a position where they can say that they can make a difference.
                    Tom's problem was that he contrasted Julius Katz who was also a superb
                    bureaucrat. Tom sort of bulldozed the bureaucracy and his half-life or shelf
                    life in any position was generally about two years. By the end of two years he
                    so alienated and pissed off everybody else around him that he had to move on.
                    This happened to him in EB when he was assistant secretary. As an assistant
                    secretary he would take on the Secretary of the Treasury in interagency meetings
                    and stopped just short of calling him a damn fool. People were afraid of him
                    because he was both so bright and so direct. I became, particularly in
                    multilateral exercises, in Europe I became sort of the soft side of Tom Enders
                    in effect, and he would send me out to be the investigator because he recognized
                    that probably I was better suited to do that than he was. I then worked for him
                    later when I was in Latin American affairs. I was probably the only person ever
                    to work for him twice on the senior level because he could be very difficult. He
                    and I became very close friends and I have a great deal of regard for him
                    personally and professionally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he and Katz get on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They got along very well. I mean Julius would occasionally get
                    exacerbated with Tom because he saw as I did that Tom could have been even more
                    effective if he had been just a little bit more malleable. Finally, it would
                    have been in '76 I guess, maybe late '75, Kissinger got such heat from the White
                    House and the Treasury and other places that he had to let him go. So, he sent
                    him to Ottawa as ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, there's a famous remark that Kissinger made about
                        Enders but I can't remember it. So, you were in this job from '75
                        until?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: '75, '76, well, let's see I went back in '74 and in 1976 I became
                    deputy assistant secretary in charge of energy, commodities and raw materials in
                    food policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you got this job because Katz in the office put you
                        up for it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: That's right. I'd you know, done as director of fuels and energy, they
                    thought I'd done a good job and I'd had a lot of international exposure and a
                    lot of exposure within Washington. So, this was kind of a natural move.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were the deputy assistant secretary for fuels,
                        energy, raw materials, and commodities. This is 1976?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: 1976.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what did that job add to your previous portfolio?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, I continued to spend a lot of time on energy, but I had an office
                    director under me who was doing that. What it added to my, it came at the same
                    time that I was dealing in this international forum in Paris so it added
                    commodity policy, things like international sugar agreements, international
                    coffee agreements, it added food policy, an international wheat agreement.
                    Importantly, it added responsibility for leading a U.S. response to demands from
                    the developing world for more commodities, more efforts to establish greater
                    predictability in commodity prices on revenues that the producers would earn. It
                    was another part of the new international economic order.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are these agreements really that one can make and it can
                        work do you think? Was it often more of a kind of an exercise?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Political.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Appear to try to be responsive, but you have the market
                        out there that's doing this stuff, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: That's right and I became more and more convinced of the power of the
                    market the more I worked on these things. So, then in, let's see in '76 the
                    administration changed. Carter came in, Ford left and Kissinger left at the same
                    time and Cy Vance became Assistant Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, you mean, he became.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, he was the Secretary. I continued doing basically what I was doing
                    except that the government set up the Department of Energy, the Federal Energy
                    Agency, the Federal Energy Administration and Jim Schlesinger became the sort of
                    energy czar within the Carter administration and I became quite friendly with
                    him. I spent a lot of time with him and Cy Vance and others in the State
                    Department were very nervous about Schlesinger because he had been Secretary of
                    Defense and he was power in Washington. They kind of relied on me to keep track
                    of what he was doing, not that I was ever totally successful at that, but I
                    traveled with him a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a pretty formidable figure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Very formidable. He and Enders and Kissinger were the most formidable
                    people I was associated with. I've remained close to Jim throughout the years.
                    He's a very decent man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In working with him then, what sort of issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Oil price increases. We would lean on the Saudis to try to get them to
                    resist efforts within OPEC to increase oil prices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Not really. They exercised a certain amount of restraint that they
                    might not have exercised otherwise, but their interests were very consistent
                    with ours is that given the large reserves, they didn't have an interest in
                    having prices so high that they would force people to stop using oil and thereby
                    cut into their future earnings.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: There was a split within OPEC. There were OPEC countries that had large
                    populations that wanted as much as they would earn now and countries like Saudi
                    Arabia who didn't have large populations who wanted to stretch their earnings
                    for more allowed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're now in about 1976 and he's the deputy assistant
                        secretary in the Bureau of Economic Affairs and you worked on energy and you
                        worked on commodities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of relationship would you say that you had
                        overall with people like the Treasury Department? Talk a little bit about
                        the intergovernmental tugs in these places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They were complicated relationships. Treasury in particular did not
                    automatically agree that the State Department should have the lead on some of
                    these issues. A lot of it depended upon personal relationships. I think I was
                    fairly successful in not co-opting, but including the senior people in the
                    Treasury Department at my level at least into the gestation of policy, making
                    them feel that they were a part of it. In truth they contributed a lot. So, I
                    always took the posture of inclusion rather than exclusion. Treasury was the
                    principal other bureaucratic player in this. There was a tendency, particularly
                    in the republican administration, also in the Carter administration for Treasury
                    to take a somewhat more market oriented position on things than the State
                    Department might have taken because we were obviously interested in trying to
                    seek political arrangements on some issues, not necessarily in having an
                    ideological confrontation over economic over market issues. By and large it
                    worked pretty well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you work with people at the Agriculture Department
                        much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, on some issues we worked very closely with the Agriculture
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, there you were really confronting the international or the U.S.
                    domestic agricultural interests. I remember defending a sugar agreement that we
                    had been negotiating. Frank Church summoned me to Idaho for a hearing that he
                    was conducting. He was then chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in the
                    heart of sugar beet country. We had just concluded a sugar arrangement that
                    needless to say the sugar beet owners were not all that happy with because they
                    were used to a system in which they were paid basically subsidized prices for
                    their sugar production. That was not one of the easiest experiences of my life,
                    but yes, I would come up against these kinds of interests periodically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that and I've read a lot about the sugar
                        business myself, but did you find that the domestic agricultural interests
                        generally get their way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They're very powerful and yes, they generally at least they don't lose
                    a lot. We've seen it in the last year in the domestic agricultural bill, which
                    came out of the Bush administration, which is a blatant tilt of U.S. policy
                    toward domestic agricultural interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So domestic politics had a lot to do with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: In these jobs in foreign policy you better have a good grounding in
                    what's happening in terms of domestic politics and an ability that became
                    increasingly important as I went on to deal with individual members of congress.
                    I would go up and testify on some of these commodity issues in the congress, on
                    oil issues. I'd deal with staffers and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's often said that the State Department is very good at
                        dealing with foreign governments, but not with our own government
                        particularly with congress and domestic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, I think there is some validity in that charge in that we don't
                    tend to produce people who are sort of naturally attuned to domestic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: why do you think that is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Because we recruit people, we foster people who have an international
                    orientation and to some extent people on the Hill are suspicious, not all of
                    them, but some of them are suspicious of the State Department because they think
                    that we basically, that our constituency is international not domestic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think the Department falls down in training on not
                        orienting enough people to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. I think there are individual exceptions to this and usually those
                    are a result of people being given jobs or having experiences at sort of a mid
                    point in their career to bring them into contact with congress and give them
                    some sensitivity as to how to deal with congress. I mean it's not a mystery.
                    Basically you remember that the guy you're dealing with needs to be reelected.
                    So, he needs to be able to say to his constituents that he got what they needed
                    from the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the administration changes at the beginning '77, the
                        democrats come in, Mr. Vance comes in as Secretary of a new president. Did
                        you spend much time with Vance or his senior people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: A certain amount of time, yes, with Vance and Dick Cooper who was Under
                    Secretary for Economic Affairs. I spent a good deal of time with him and with
                    Tony Solomon who was Deputy Secretary of Treasury. Fred Bergsten at
                    Treasury.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see a change then in-between these two?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, actually there was quite a change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean people say interests are constant, but what sense
                        did you get when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Among the democrats there was a greater disposition to look at
                    commodity agreements under certain circumstances not that we ever negotiated
                    any, but they were at least prepared to look at them. These were all very bright
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Vance interested in economic questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Not particularly, no. I got to know him immediately because we had the
                    completing ministerial meeting at the conference center International Economic
                    Cooperation in Paris, this north south bake off and Vance came for that. He was
                    there two or three days and I spent most of that time with him trying to advise
                    him on what was going on. It was very complicated. These poor guys, the
                    democrats were sort of parachuted into the last few months of this conference
                    that they had not been responsible for starting. The senior official level had
                    sort of cooked everything and gotten it ready to go. We had a carefully
                    identified series of tradeoffs that we thought could be negotiated. These guys
                    came in and they were convinced that their negotiating aptitude and within a few
                    hours they had given away every major tradeoff we had. So, we were left there
                    kind of naked. The conference concluded, but did not conclude, as it should not
                    have, with any major agreements. These were not things that could be governed by
                    international agreements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean this is always an issue when you have a transition
                        especially between parties and so forth that in some sense is a kind of a
                        weakness in our system. So, the north south thing came to an end this
                        dialogue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: That dialogue did. The debate shifted back into the UN structure by and
                    large, UNCTAD and other UN bodies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really not a great deal tangibly came of all this you
                        would say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was much more of a political exercise.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It was a political show.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you're in EB and how long did you stay there in this
                        DAS position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I left EB in 19, the end of 1978, early 1979. I was nominated to go to
                    Tunisia as ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting because you were not a product of the
                        geographic bureau structure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, I had no home bureau so to speak.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, exactly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: But at that point there was a desire on the part of the seventh floor
                    in the State Department. I'm not sure who it was, Cy Vance, Warren Christopher
                    and others to show that people doing economic work could advance to the senior
                    level as well as people doing political work. Very early on, not early on, but
                    they eventually ended up taking two people, myself and one other out of the
                    bureau of economic affairs and sending us off as ambassadors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the other one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The other one was a fellow named Paul Boeker. Paul went to Bolivia and
                    I went to Tunisia. As I'd said, prior to that I'd done a good deal of work with
                    Jim Schlesinger. I'd traveled with him to China and the Gulf and other places.
                    The Iranian revolution was bursting just as I was leaving and I got involved in
                    an effort to articulate a policy response to what was happening to oil prices
                    then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was NEA unhappy about your appointment at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, they didn't seem to be. I mean I'd worked with some of these guys
                    in the north south exercise in Paris and I knew people like Hal Saunders and Roy
                    Atherton and others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because Tunisia would have been one of their attractive

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, it was indeed. It was one place where you could go and be
                    effective fairly soon without long grounding in Middle Eastern issues.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The spring of '79.</hi>

                <p>BOSWORTH: Barry King was the first DCM and then a fellow named David Mack who
                    later went on to be ambassador to the United Arab Emirates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that you had enough shall we say management
                        experience at this point? Did you worry about that or did the Department try
                        to do anything as far as. In other words you're suddenly from having been in
                        a small economic section I mean a small unit that you ran in Paris, you had
                        a big job in Washington, but then you're going out to an embassy where
                        you've got to oversee Admin, Consular, Political and then work with agency
                        people, maybe Peace Corps and all that sort of stuff. You felt you were able
                        to step into that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, I think I've learned through experience enough about management to
                    make me feel rightly or wrongly comfortable about my authority to do that. I was
                    a firm believer in delegation, delegation with accountability. I learned very
                    early on that as soon as you have anybody working for you, you had to be willing
                    to accept their product as your own willing putting your imprint all over it as
                    long as it maintained the requisite standard.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I had a very unpleasant experience with a fellow I worked for my first
                    year in Madrid. I had done a lot of writing. I thought I could write. I wasn't
                    Hemingway, but I could write clear prose and he would take great pains spending
                    more time editing my stuff than I'd spent writing it. Without in my judgment at
                    least improving the quality. So, I always said I would not do that to people who
                    worked for me. That doesn't mean that I didn't occasionally and sometimes
                    frequently edit stuff, but I tried to do it in a way that didn't discourage
                    people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's often said that the Department is weak in management.
                        That's why I was curious, but obviously you had a successful career to put
                        it mildly. So, you went out in the spring of '79 to Tunisia and how big a
                        post was it would you say?</hi>

                <p>BOSWORTH: It was a small, I think it was what they called then a class three
                    embassy. It had three people in the political section, two or three people in
                    the economic section. It had a large AID mission, which I enjoyed because I like
                    to get into those issues. It had a large Peace Corps program, which I also
                    enjoyed. We had a military attach�, a defense attach� and then a significant
                    logistic tail that was run basically by the State Department.</p>

                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, there was also a language school there, but I had only the Admin
                    Counselor basically took care of that along with the DCM, David Mack, when he
                    was there because he was a product of that school. I had very deliberately tried
                    to find a DCM who was an Arabist and David was.</p>

                <p>BOSWORTH: They gave me a list and I told them from the beginning that I wanted an
                    Arabist, I wanted somebody who could be a complement to me.</p>

                <p>We're resuming on day two with Ambassador Bosworth and let me ask you sir, what
                    did you see as the relationship or how did the relationship work between the
                    economic bureau and the other bureaus of the State Department, particularly I
                    think in the geographic bureaus? There must have been some policy tugs back and
                    forth, how did it go?</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: There were frequent policy tugs. I think in those years the bureau of
                    economic affairs or EB as it was called, had some advantages in terms of people
                    particularly in the Enders-Katz years they provided very strong leadership
                    within the building and within the bureaucracy. Enders in particular had a very
                    direct relationship with Kissinger, when Kissinger was Secretary. Then Katz and
                    Joe Greenwald who was also Assistant Secretary had close relationships under
                    Vance. There was a woman who was executive director of the bureau, who had been
                    there for years, Frances Wilson, who I think has since passed away. She was a
                    power, tower of continuity within the bureau and regarded economic officers as
                    sort of her chicks and she was going to take care of them. So, she fought
                    fearlessly within the bureaucracy including within the promotion system to get
                    economic officers treated at least on a par with political officers and
                    hopefully in her view higher. But there were policy tugs all the time. I think
                    in those years in the mid '70s EB was benefited by the fact that many of the
                    major crises that the U.S. or problems that the U.S. was dealing with,
                    particularly the energy crisis and some trade questions and the overall
                    north-south set of issues were global in nature. They really didn't pertain
                    specifically to any one geographic bureau so that the bureau of economic affairs
                    within the State Department was very much the lead bureau. I remember when we
                    used to go off to our meetings in Paris on the International Energy Agency and
                    then to the north-south dialogue meetings in Paris, we would frequently
                    particularly for the latter have regional bureau representatives with us who
                    were various kinds of advisors, but not in any way really central to policy
                    making process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: now did you find particularly where energy was a big
                        issue, how did it go with bureaus like NEA as far as an issue went, was it
                        generally cooperative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It was generally quite cooperative, yes. We had no interest in being
                    confrontational with the oil producers. On the other hand, I think we were
                    trying to build a kind of consumer solidarity that some of the oil producing
                    countries found threatening. By and large the people in NEA, starting at the top
                    with Hal Saunders, and others, were very supportive of what we were trying to
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a position you referred to an under secretary
                        for economic affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your relationship with the EB to that person and
                        why was there an under secretary for economic affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Good question. I'm not sure why there was or why there still is except
                    that it is someone on the seventh floor who was supposed to be the primary point
                    of connection between the economic aspects of the State Department and the
                    Secretary. When Enders was there the under secretary was a man named, well,
                    first Bill Donaldson who went on to become as we all know chairman of the SEC.
                    Bill I've actually gotten to know quite well in later years. He had a lot of
                    trouble when he was there largely because he was imposed on Kissinger by the
                    White House and Kissinger had no use for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did they impose him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: For political reasons in the White House. He was a product coming out
                    of the Nixon administration and he only stayed probably four or five months and
                    then left. He was followed by a fellow named Chuck Robinson. I have no idea
                    where he is now, but Robinson and Enders, Robinson believed that he should be in
                    charge of all of these issues. Of course for Tom Enders that was simply not
                    acceptable. He would not tolerate anybody being between him and the Secretary of
                    State. By and large Tom won. Kissinger used to get very exacerbated with Tom
                    because his insistence on not going through Robinson on various issues
                    complicated Kissinger's life. On the other hand, Kissinger respected Tom's
                    abilities so much that he wasn't prepared to make a big issue of this. Tom
                    basically either ignored or treated Robinson with disdain as only Enders could
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That position, was it a job or was it just in a sense to
                        supervise the economic bureau or was it to just sort of prove that the
                        Department was in fact giving visibility to economic issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right, I think largely the latter, to some extent the former, but it
                    was also I think ideally it functioned best at an interagency level. I think
                    that's what it does now. The current occupant of the job Alan Larson was a
                    holdover from the last administration. Alan worked for me 20 years ago and he is
                    a very bright capable guy. I think his value added is that he can meet with the
                    special trade representatives and other senior economic people in Washington in
                    a way that an assistant secretary in the current structure just can't. That
                    never stopped Enders and he did it, but I think that probably Alan Larson does
                    it now from the seventh floor. He seems to be a more senior representative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little bit more about the relationship of economic
                        officers to the State Department. You had indicated one of the factors apart
                        from your obvious abilities in getting a job as ambassador to Tunisia was
                        the fact that at that moment there was a push on to give some of these jobs
                        that are considered plum assignments to economic officers. So, in your
                        experience, how did economic officers generally place in the sociology of
                        the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, they were definitely subordinate to lower on the pecking order
                    than political officers by and large. You know, in the '60s and the first half
                    of the '70s, probably the best thing to be from a career point of view in the
                    State Department would to be a political officer working on Western Europe. EUR
                    political officers were looked upon as the princelings of the Foreign Service
                    and considered themselves such. Then what happened I think beginning probably
                    with the energy crisis or perhaps even before that, more and more of America's
                    foreign policy concerns became economic in nature. The State Department had to
                    give greater recognition to the people who were doing this and it had to be sure
                    that the people who were working on economic issues were among the best they
                    had. They couldn't afford if they wanted to prevail in the bureaucratic wars in
                    Washington; they couldn't afford to use people who were not able to hold their
                    own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have the sense then that over the years that
                        economic officers have gotten a fair share of the sort of plum jobs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They've gotten more I think as you look at it on a per capita basis,
                    probably economic officers still don't get as many key DCMships and key
                    ambassadorships as do political officers. They have I think the Department over
                    the last ten years or so, I have not been that close to it has spread things out
                    a little more evenly. You find consular officers now getting ambassadorships
                    where they, that was very rare 15 or 20 years ago. Administrative officers even
                    get a few ambassadorships. The testing ground for career officer ambassadorships
                    has always been the DCM route and for a long time most DCMs of significant posts
                    were political officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exactly. Did you have the sense that the political
                        officers were focused on trying to educate themselves in economic issues
                        sufficiently, to be ready if the substance of their jobs was in many ways
                        was going to be economic issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, some of the best of them clearly did and they recognized that to
                    do their jobs well, they needed to have some grounding in economics, but there
                    were still large numbers of officers who were basically not numerate, anything
                    with a number in it scared them and they backed away from it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little bit, you said the other day that when you
                        got to be a deputy assistant secretary that you spent a fair amount of time
                        with James Schlesinger who was then the secretary of energy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, at that point he was in the White House. He was the president's
                    special advisor for energy.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this with Ford or Carter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: This was with Carter. Ford had fired Schlesinger from DOD and
                    Schlesinger did not take that well understandably. So, when Carter was elected
                    Schlesinger volunteered his services and Carter accepted. Jim was the most
                    prominent senior republican serving in the Carter administration. In the first
                    year of the Carter administration they proceeded to set up the Department of
                    Energy. In the interim Jim was lodged in the White House. He was doing a fair
                    amount of traveling and also of course working the Hill very assiduously trying
                    to put together key pieces of energy legislation, which by and large he did. He
                    had working for him as eventually his assistant secretary of energy for
                    international affairs in the State Department a former colleague of mine and a
                    fairly good friend who had been coincidentally in the embassy in Madrid when I
                    was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: A fellow named Harry Bergold. Harry had worked in the Defense
                    Department under Schlesinger when Schlesinger was Secretary and had become very
                    close to him. Jim had a lot of confidence in Harry, but Harry had no interest in
                    energy and the sort of technicalities of energy. So, because he and I got along
                    very well, we worked out a pretty good arrangement in which he was sort of the
                    assistant secretary who was representing the energy department, but I was
                    Schlesinger's particularly inside advisor on what's really happening
                    internationally. I would get calls from him once or twice a week asking to come
                    over. He wanted to talk about a certain issue or a given set of problems. I was
                    working in many ways very directly for him. In fact when I left to go to Tunisia
                    he gave me a distinguished service award from the Department of Energy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, how did you find working with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Challenging. This is a very smart guy, very demanding, very gruff in
                    some ways, but the gruffness was more a product I found of shyness than anything
                    else. I liked him. I respected him and I got along with him quite well. I think
                    by and large we did some good work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you traveled with him. Where did you go and why
                        with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, as this was before the energy department was formally set up I
                    think we went to, first of all we went to Europe. He was skeptical about the
                    International Energy Agency when he first came to office because it was seen by
                    him correctly as a State Department controlled exercise. He and I and Bergold
                    worked out an arrangement whereby Bergold and I sort of co-chaired U.S.
                    delegations to the IEA. I wanted Schlesinger to become familiar with the agency
                    to meet the people from other governments who were involved so one of his first
                    trips was a trip to Europe. He went to France and Germany and I traveled with
                    him. That was the first time I spent an extended period of time with him while
                    on the road. Then in let's see it would have been '78 I guess we went to Morocco
                    and Saudi Arabia. That was an interesting, fascinating trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a little bit about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, in Morocco, Schlesinger knew King Hassan quite well, so we
                    stopped and had an audience with the king in Marrakech and a dinner. Of course
                    for me that was the first time I'd met King Hassan and I was quite taken by this
                    experience. I had not been in North Africa previously. From there we went to
                    Saudi Arabia. We went to Jeddah first and then Riyadh and then over to the
                    ARAMCO facilities on the East Coast and met with the king and the various
                    princes, the foreign minister and others. So, it was an interesting insight into
                    how Saudi Arabia functioned. I was the only State Department officer on the
                    trip. Schlesinger had been Secretary of Defense and had also been head of the
                    CIA, which is how he knew so many of these people on a kind of intimate basis,
                    and it was very heady. Quite an experience to travel with someone like that with
                    that kind of intellectual luster with whom I was developing a good close
                    relationship and meeting these people and being sort of at the heart of the
                    issues that were really concerning many in the United States. Would Saudi Arabia
                    for example consent to another round of oil price increases?</p>
                <p>Then in 1978 the end of '78, I accompanied him on a trip to China. I had never
                    been to China before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did you go to China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: To talk to the Chinese about energy concerns, but more importantly, I
                    mean he viewed being Secretary of Energy as sort of giving him license to get
                    involved in various foreign policy and national security issues. This was in a
                    period before we had normalized diplomatic relations with China. Leonard
                    Woodcock was there as head of the U.S. interests section. There was a lot of
                    interest in China in Washington in those years. People were traveling there all
                    the time, but I had never been there before. We spent two weeks traveling all
                    around China and meeting with China's officials and seeing things. It was really
                    quite illuminating for me. It was a great trip.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you this, you worked on these energy issues
                        intensively for many years at very high levels.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a sense, I don't want to be too broad, but what would
                        you say is like the guy said after the, what came of it in the end after the
                        Battle of Waterloo. What came in your mind at the end? You have an
                        International Energy Agency, which has never actually had to do what it was
                        set up to do if I understood you because it doesn't really allocate, but
                        it's there I guess if it needs to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What else would you say came of all these endeavors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think the most important, probably the most concrete was the
                    development of the sense of consumer solidarity on the question of energy. We
                    not only had the emergency sharing plan, we began to develop various programs in
                    long term research and development activity in the energy area, many of which
                    still go on. Probably the IEA's most important function over the years has been
                    to ensure a degree of transparency in the oil industry that did not exist
                    before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It means that governments and people had some sense of why prices go up
                    and why prices come down and during the '73 '74 crisis there was a great feeling
                    that somehow the oil companies were giving preference to the United States. In
                    fact they really weren't and now within the IEA there is a mechanism in which
                    the oil companies report periodically on pricing and the supply questions. I
                    think by and large people now have some degree of assurance that everyone is
                    being treated more or less equitably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, the notions that the fleet of tankers are hiding
                        offshore with the oil, that's not really.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right. No. So, the oil companies in the end welcomed this because it
                    gave them public credibility of a sort that they hadn't had before. That has
                    been an important contribution. Also over the years the IEA has become sort of
                    the respected source of data and projections. Is oil demand going up, is it
                    going down, what does supply look like? So, it has played a very important role
                    in that sense. It has never actually had to allocate oil, but the mechanism is
                    there if it ever decided it needed to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, does it have like a permanent secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Oh yes, it's attached to the OECD in Paris. It has a permanent
                    secretary, which is now I think run by a Brit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it basically a Western organization? I mean does it
                        have Arab or Venezuelan members?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Basically, no it does not have any producer country members, but Japan
                    and Korea are now members of it. Japan was a member from the beginning. Korea
                    for a few years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean producer exporter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think the results might have been politically
                        from this? I mean did OPEC come to realize its, I don't want to say
                        responsibilities better, but become more sensitive as to what might happen
                        as a result of, before the embargo clearly it didn't know what was going to
                        happen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think some countries within OPEC did. I think key people within OPEC
                    particularly say the Saudis and the Kuwaitis and in the earlier day the Iraqis
                    and the Iranians began to understand that those countries that have the largest
                    oil reserves had an interest in pursuing pricing policies which did not
                    encourage consuming countries to accelerate the development of alternative
                    sources of energy. In other words, they had an interest in making sure that the
                    last drop of oil that they produced had a market. So, I think it has moderated
                    the pricing policies to some extent. On the other hand, I would also argue that
                    by and large the market has been a fundamental importance in setting oil prices
                    over the years. Saudi Arabia has been the swing producer. They have gone up or
                    down as necessary much of the time, not always, but much of the time as
                    necessary to keep prices more or less stable.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you one other thing here and that is, I wanted
                        to just ask about maybe some details of a particular commodity negotiation
                        and discussion. One thought I had was sugar, but if there is another one
                        that strikes you as being particularly interesting. I don't know whether
                        when you were in EB, I don't know, citrus, or did they work on coffee
                        agreements?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: We worked on coffee agreements. We never really had a commodity a price
                    targeted commodity agreement in coffee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sugar is a big domestic American constituency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Sugar is a big domestic American constituency which made it very
                    complicated and within the United States there were sharp differences because
                    you have the cane producers in Louisiana and the beet producers in the West. The
                    beet producers were only able to survive with heavy subsidies. In other words if
                    they had to sell sugar at what was then a world market price they would have
                    been out of business in two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say the subsidy, do you mean a direct payment
                        support from the U.S. Of a tariff that raises the price for everybody?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Exactly. Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Presumably you worked away at this issue. Did the
                        Department ever try to take the position that the free market should operate
                        or was it just clear from the beginning that politically that was not going
                        to be possible?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: In the case of sugar that was just not going to be possible. To some
                    extent the same problem that we have had for so long in the textile business,
                    but for political reasons, even though it doesn't make a lot of economic sense,
                    we want to maintain domestic sugar production. People stretched to the utmost to
                    find the economic justification for that. It's usually based on national
                    security that in the event of war, a la World War II we don't want to not have
                    the ability to produce sugar. It's blatantly absurd, but they have a lot of
                    votes and they control a lot of congressional delegations or influence a lot of
                    congressional delegations. You just have to take that as a given now. The EU was
                    then the EC; the EU has the same problem in spades. They should not be producing
                    large amounts of sugar either, which they then sell at a directly subsidized
                    price around the world. Sugar should be produced by and large in developing
                    countries. That's where the growing conditions are best and labor costs are
                    lowest, but the EU like the United States even more blatantly than the United
                    States wants to produce for political reasons continue to produce beet sugar and
                    their farmers require subsidies in order to do that.</p>

                    <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, sugar obviously must have been one element of this
                        so-called north south dialogue which I guess got going in the '70s. There
                        were as you were saying yesterday, there were big meetings in Paris on the
                        subject.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does that exist in some form today as it did then? Is
                        there a group that comes together and talks about these things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think there is still UNCTAD the U.S. UN something or other which
                    focuses on commodities. I think that a lot of the fervor of those issues has
                    dissipated over the years. We were struggling mightily to resist something
                    called the common fund for commodities back in the '70s. Basically, that was a
                    desire on the part of the producing companies largely the G77 to have the
                    industrialized countries contribute money to a common fund which would be used
                    to as they said improve commodity production and make commodity production more
                    efficient in some areas and could be used to stabilize markets by intervening in
                    markets where prices became too low. We for obvious reasons basically because we
                    regarded it, the other industrialized countries did as well, as sort of a back
                    door unofficial development assistance of foreign aid. We resisted this
                    mightily. In the end it was never really enacted. There was some sort of
                    agreement that kind of papered over the differences that was struck sometime
                    after I left the battle. This was a time when the developing countries largely
                    because of the experience with the oil industry, the oil markets believed that
                    they could use their political influence, political weight to get economic
                    concessions out of the West. The West was determined to keep talking about
                    market oriented policies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They saw the example of oil and could they apply this to
                        other commodities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And control the prices.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: As it turned out of course they really didn't control oil either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not on the long term.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Not on the long term because as the price went up a new supply came in.
                    You had Mexico, you had the North Sea, you had the North Slope, so a new supply
                    came in and the market rebalanced at a lower price level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the developing countries try to use the commodity
                        issue as a lever, you know, saying if we don't get better prices we'll have
                        social unrest and that can lead to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Oh, sure there was an element of that. It was more implicit than
                    explicit for the most part. But, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's go on then to Tunisia. You went to Tunisia in
                        1979.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: In March of '79.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: March of '79. What were the major issues that you were
                        confronting then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, the major issues were then basically Tunisia's concern over Libya
                    and our concern about Libya and Qadhafi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was Tunisia concerned about Libya?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Because they viewed him as aggressive, as interested in consolidating a
                    position in North Africa. He would periodically issue declarations calling for
                    sort of a pan Arab unity in North Africa various federations and federal schemes
                    that would sort of knit the countries together. He never really had any basis in
                    fact, but it was almost all hortatory, but it made the Tunisians very nervous.
                    At one point soon after I arrived, there was a gang of Libyan commandos, I don't
                    think they were very organized, but they came across the border and attacked a
                    police post in a small southern town in Tunisia. The Tunisian government called
                    for U.S. support, U.S. assistance. In a largely symbolic move we brought in two
                    big C5 aircraft with various pieces of military equipment onboard and unloaded
                    them visibly and tried to calm the Tunisians down and it basically worked.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>The other big thing that happened when I was there and this was very interesting
                    to me, that was the time when the Iranian hostages were taken in our embassy.
                    The president was Bourguiba who by this time was in his '80s and was failing. He
                    would have good days and bad days, good hours and bad hours, but he was a
                    determined friend of the United States. He gave us credit for basically having
                    kept the French from arresting him during World War II and giving him the
                    opportunity to become the George Washington of Tunisia. This is a man with a
                    very expanded vision of himself in a historical role, but his historical role
                    was indeed quite important. He had one story about this experience of how the
                    American Consul in Tunis during the war smuggled him out of Tunis before the
                    French could get him. He told that over and over and over to American visitors.
                    When the Iranian hostages were taken there was of course that vote in the UN
                    Security Council in which we needed a majority to condemn Iran for having seized
                    our diplomats. Tunisia happened to be on the security council and of course as
                    an Islamic country, an Arab country, this was a very tough issue for them and
                    had Bourguiba taken a straw vote within his cabinet it would have been unanimous
                    against joining the U.S. in this. Yet he himself made the determination, I had
                    gone to see him, made a strong demarche on instruction from Washington and he
                    made the decision himself to support the U.S. and cast the Tunisian vote in
                    favor of the U.S. position on the resolution. It was something that earned great
                    appreciation in Washington. This was a time when we were very tough force. So,
                    about a week later the sixth fleet came through and the commander of the fleet,
                    a vice admiral, when the sixth fleet came in the commander would always come and
                    call on the president. I accompanied him to this meeting with the president as I
                    accompanied all and I'll never forget this. He thanked him for the support on
                    the hostage issue and presented Bourguiba with his midshipman's sword, which of
                    course naval officers only have one of and he gave it to Bourguiba. Bourguiba
                    who at that point was as I say he had good days and bad days, he was rather
                    frail and rather uncertain. He took the sword out of its scabbard and started
                    waving it around. The palace chief of protocol was a young Foreign Service guy
                    and myself were trying to back up and stay out of the reach of this saber he
                    waved around. Finally the protocol guy took it away from him and in effect went
                    up and took his wrist, so it all worked out fine. But Bourguiba, it was quite an
                    experience dealing with this guy. He had this great affection for the United
                    States, a great sense of appreciation and would do almost anything that we
                    wanted.</p>
                <p>There was another time when he was giving a reception on a national day or on a
                    feast day which was basically an Islamic feast day and it was a national holiday
                    in Tunis. About 10:00 in the morning the protocol chief called me and said the
                    president has asked why you are not attending this reception. I said for many
                    reasons. First of all because I'm not Muslim and my country is not Muslim. He
                    said, no, I know that, but the president would like to see you, he wants you to
                    attend. I got dressed and my official car wasn't around so I drove our personal
                    car down the hill to the palace. In Tunis the embassy residence is up on a hill
                    overlooking the palace. A great place. I went through the receiving line and of
                    course all of my Islamic colleagues in the diplomatic corps were befuddled as to
                    why I was there. It was just one of those kinds of things that happened
                    frequently when Bourguiba was around. I don't know what it's like now. I've not
                    been back to Tunis, but I'd like to go back at some point. It's a lovely little
                    country.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were there three years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I was actually only there two years and about four months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So one issue was the one as you said about the American
                        hostages in Iran. How did our relations there play in the broader questions
                        that we had with the Arab world would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I arrived about two weeks after Camp David and Tunisia under great
                    pressure had broken relations with Egypt so I had a brief meeting with the
                    Egyptian ambassador before he was packing his bags and leaving. That period
                    there was a PLO mission in Tunis. It was a difficult period for the Tunisians,
                    Mid-East diplomacy and for American Mid-East diplomacy. There was a strong
                    Palestinian presence in Tunisia. Palestinians were very much engaged in Tunisia
                    in very constructive ways. I mean they were basically running the country in
                    some respects as they were running many countries in the Arab world. They
                    provided the brain power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About his experiences in Tunisia and he was talking about
                        the influences of Palestinians there. You were saying that they ran a lot of
                        stuff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They ran a lot of stuff. They were very capable people. Many of them
                    had been there for two or even three generations, but they still felt very
                    Palestinian. They were not assimilated into the Tunisian population. We had a
                    couple of Palestinians working for us in the U.S. embassy who were among our
                    more capable non-American employees. In fact I wouldn't qualify among our more
                    capable employees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you account for that culturally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think there is a high premium, there was and I hope still is, I don't
                    know, on education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why for them and not maybe for others in the area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They were I think by and large more urbanized, more cosmopolitan. They
                    were not Bedouins, they were not nomads, they were staked to the ground, this in
                    the former Palestine. For whatever reason they were in many ways standing stood
                    out in terms of their capability.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, they would have an influence on countries as it
                        reacted to things like the Camp David process in other words?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now the PLO had its mission there although I think Arafat
                        did not come out of Lebanon until '82 I think, but the PLO had its mission,
                        its office there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right. They had a mission there as they did in almost all Arab
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now we couldn't talk to them formally, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: We weren't supposed to. I mean I would run into them a lot and we had
                    receptions and national days. I would always be civil to them. I really didn't
                    have anything to say to them of any substance. There was nothing I engaged them
                    on that had any real meaning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Did you have the sense that they tried in any way
                        to work against or undermine Bourguiba's regime in any general way or they
                        just focused on their particular issue internationally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think they just focused on their issue. Bourguiba was quite
                    pro-Palestine of course in his dealings on the Middle Eastern process. He had
                    been more accepting of the existence of Israel than most other Arab leaders, but
                    he was nonetheless fairly pro-Palestinian. I think he personally favored the
                    Camp David accord, but he was simply not able to stand against the wave of the
                    rest of the Arab countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the wake of the Camp David thing, did the Tunisians
                        themselves attempt to play having barely broken diplomatic relations, a
                        minimum of public relations purposes, did they attempt to play a significant
                        role in the Palestinian Israeli issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Not really. I mean a Tunisian whose name escapes me at the moment
                    became head of the Islamic conference about that time and through him they were
                    trying to play some sort of a role. They also within the Arab councils were able
                    to play a role, but they were very conscious of their relatively small size. The
                    other Arab countries were somewhat suspicious of Tunisia because of its European
                    ties, the fact that French was widely spoken there, their strong attachment with
                    the U.S. So, they were not real major players in any way on the Middle Eastern
                    issues. I followed those issues a lot and would have conversations with Tunisian
                    officials about them when we were making demarches around the Arab capitals on
                    various points. I would go in and make them, but this was not sort of a
                    centerpiece of my work where it would have been for example if I had been in
                    Jordan or had I been in Syria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you were not an NEA hand or an Arabist either way. Do
                        you want to talk, one of the issues that always comes up about NEA and
                        somebody wrote a book about this, too, but it was a little negative toward
                        the Foreign Service Officers in NEA, one side seemed to say that NEA was
                        really a real Arabist entity that was very anti-Israel. The working level
                        officers, the other side would tend to say no, that in fact they sort of
                        looked down on Arabs and were much more impressed on the technological
                        democratic achievements of Israel and really didn't care much for the Arabs
                        in general. I wonder if you had any sense either way on that issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think probably. First of all if you were going to be an NEA type, if
                    you're going to spend most of your career in NEA or out in the field or in
                    Washington, the reality is that there's only one Israel and there are a lot of
                    Arab countries. So, just by the function of the numbers you would spend much
                    more time in an Arab capital than you would in an Israeli capital. I think that
                    probably if there was a tilt in either direction it was modestly pro-Arab,
                    certainly anti-Israel in terms of some of the things that Israel had done, the
                    incursion into Lebanon and now of course what's going on with the Palestinians.
                    With that being said I was always impressed by the professionalism of people in
                    NEA. I think that they viewed themselves as they were as representatives of the
                    United States and it was U.S. interest that they were trying to promote. The
                    problem of course was that as a country we've never been able to really
                    articulate very clearly our interest in this very complicated part of the world
                    other than to say we're for peace. There are times when peace is disrupted from
                    the Arab side, times when it's disrupted from the Israeli side. Usually its
                    disrupted from both sides, so its not surprising that it seems to me that
                    America's representatives in the region tend to be identified with whatever
                    fashion is on the rise at the moment. We don't really have a coherent national
                    policy on the Middle East, so it's not surprising that individual NEA officers
                    have difficulty defining themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you say the American interests were in a small
                        country like Tunisia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Basically to, well, at the time, they were basically to have a
                    sympathetic ear for some of our concerns about broader issues in the Middle
                    East, to have basically a pro-Western orientation. This was an important country
                    for the U.S., for the U.S. in that region surrounded by Algeria on the one side
                    and Libya on the other, so it was really Tunisia and Morocco as voices that we
                    could more or less count on to be reasonable with regard to their attitudes
                    toward us. The issue of Islamic fundamentalism had just begun to emerge in
                    Tunisia when I was there and it was not yet an acute concern. It wasn't I think
                    until several years later when we began to view Islamic fundamentalism as
                    basically an anti-Western threat. Those were primarily the U.S. interests. Well,
                    you didn't have the feeling when you were there they were sort of on the front
                    line of the Cold War. We knew the Soviets were trying to do things there, but
                    there was no real disposition on the part of any Tunisians to welcome back the
                    Soviet Union in any fashion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you could operate pretty well in French
                        without having to know Arabic there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, I could. All of the people that I dealt with in the government and
                    in the private community spoke French. I made a couple of television appearances
                    in French and gave a number of speeches in French to business groups. Now,
                    whether that's still true or not I don't know. I mean that was 20 years ago. My
                    sense then was that the country was losing its capabilities in French. English
                    was on the rise, but French was on the decline. Tunisia had a problem, because
                    the Arabic spoken in Tunisia was not Middle Eastern Egyptian standard Arabic and
                    people from the Middle East had trouble understand Tunisians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting. Did the U.S. have much of an economic stake
                        in the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Not great. I mean there were a few American oil companies there. We had
                    some interest in a pipeline that was being built to transport Algerian natural
                    gas into Europe that was being built across Tunisia. As I said some American oil
                    companies were doing some exploration work there, nothing very significant. We
                    sold a few things there, but the two things that I concentrated internally while
                    I was there was 1) our aid program which was fairly significant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little bit about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, we had a big rural development project down in central Tunisia.
                    We were trying to promote greater self-sufficiency, greater ability on the part
                    of Tunisians to grow basic commodities, particularly wheat and produce that they
                    sold into the European Union. We had a number of cooperative and other projects
                    going down there and I got quite engaged in those items. I found them
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that they worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think they were working by and large, whether they're still working,
                    I don't know. I'd be interested in going back and seeing what happened to them.
                    The other program that I got quite involved in was in the basically the
                    renovation of the Tunisian military. It was a very run down institution. So, I
                    managed to get some additional more military sales money and we managed to begin
                    the process of rebuilding their military. This was done primarily with the eye
                    on the Libyans who of course had become very much engaged with the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Libyans make serious effort to undermine the
                        government of Tunisia do you think, or was it more rhetorical?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It was somewhat rhetorical, but we were getting intelligence reports of
                    Tunisians or of Libyans rather dealing with Tunisian dissidents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Funding people?</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the U.S. have a military mission there then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, we had a military assistance mission and we also had a defense
                    attach�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: how did you find your working relations with those

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Very good, by and large, very good with both of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a Peace Corps program there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: There was a very big Peace Corps program, run by a young guy French by
                    birth, French American who was very energetic and I enjoyed very much. I would
                    travel around with him visiting Peace Corps people out in the field and that was
                    great fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you think that was a useful program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I thought it was very useful for the American Peace Corps volunteers. I
                    think over the years that's probably been its greatest value. It has produced a
                    large number of people in this country who have had the experience, which is for
                    Americans unique, of living abroad and living in very basic conditions. So, I
                    think it has been a great program for us. I wouldn't cite it as having really
                    materially advanced the process of economic development although they make
                    contributions, no question about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good point. Did the Department pay much attention to
                        Tunisia when you were there would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Not a lot. We were in the Bureau of North African Affairs. Libya and
                    Algeria demanded more attention. Morocco of course was larger. The Libyan
                    incursion in I think it was '79 or '80 brought some attention. I was quite
                    content not being under Washington's scrutiny all the time. They would sort of
                    let me run my own show.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just curious, why when the PLO came out of Lebanon
                        in 1982 or '83 why did they go to Tunisia as opposed to anyplace that they
                        might have gone to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I'm not sure, I think probably because the Tunisians were willing to
                    take them and it was a long way from Lebanon, a long way from Israel. As it
                    turned out it wasn't far enough from Israel. It didn't stop the Israelis from.
                    Well, remember they put their air force in there and destroyed a lot of PLO
                    housing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In part as you said because the PLO had had offices there
                        already that presumably could act as a base to receive them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. Tunisia was a very pleasant place to be. If you could choose
                    between Tunisia and Libya, you'd choose Tunisia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exactly. Do you think that there is a thing called a
                        Tunisian nationality?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. I think Tunisians feel Tunisian. I think they also feel Arab and I
                    think increasingly some of them feel Arabic, Muslim. It was always quite a
                    secular place. Bourguiba did a number of things such as the role of women,
                    family planning, which were just not done in other Islamic countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that stuff has stuck?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think it has by and large stuck. The fellow who is now president was
                    then the chief of military intelligence when I was there. He is very secular in
                    his orientation. Now he like other Arab leaders may have trimmed his sails
                    sufficiently to avoid major conflicts with the Islamic establishment in Tunisia,
                    but by and large it was a secular country, much more so than any other country
                    in the Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Women could go about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Women did go about unveiled at most times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Drive automobiles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Drive automobiles. In those years though you were beginning to see
                    women, younger women particularly who were going in covering wearing heavy
                    scarves, etc. Down in the small villages, you would still see women in burqas,
                    not many, but it was not unheard of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were there until, you went there in the spring of
                        '79 and you were there until the late summer of '81?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, June of '81.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: June of '81. Is that because of the change in the
                        political regime because usually ambassadors are there a little longer than
                        a couple of years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, I could have stayed at least another year and was planning to do
                    that even though quite frankly I had by that time done all the things that I
                    really wanted to do so I didn't feel terribly challenged anymore, but it was a
                    very pleasant place to be. I then got a call from Tom Enders who had just been
                    asked by Al Haig to be Assistant Secretary for Interamerican Affairs, a part of
                    the world that Enders had never been in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would Haig ask Enders to do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Because he wanted somebody who was basically a ramrod, somebody who was
                    and this was an area of great concern for the U.S. He just was looking for sort
                    of the best available athlete.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had he known Enders before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, not well, but everybody knew of Tom. At that point Tom had been
                    ambassador to Canada which is where he went when Kissinger exiled him from EB
                    and then he went to EU. He was ambassador at the EC in Brussels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does it strike you as odd and what does it say that as
                        brilliant as Enders was, that they would take someone like that and put him
                        in charge of ARA. Could you think of an analogy where they would take
                        someone like that and put him in charge of NEA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Probably not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or even EA, maybe EA, but I can't imagine that, you know,
                        what does that say in a sense?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, remember this was at the height of the fermenting problems in
                    Central America. The Sandinistas had taken power in Nicaragua. The ideologues in
                    the Reagan administration coming in were convinced that Cuba and behind Cuba the
                    Soviet Union was instrumental in making all of these things happen. They had
                    become very discontented with the sort of ARA, as it was then called, Foreign
                    Service Officer establishment — of the people who had been in and around Latin
                    America for 25 or 30 years, were sort of going from embassy to embassy, in and
                    out of the assistant secretary position. They were very unhappy with these
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that was a fair judgment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Not entirely, no. But I think ARA was a very kind of parochial place
                    and probably benefited from being shaken a bit. My sense is that it is not that
                    parochial anymore. Remember when Kissinger was Secretary he had this scheme
                    called GLOP and he was going to require that people, officers have at least one
                    tour out of their area of specialization?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think he had in mind Latin America. In any event, Tom came there with
                    a mandate to shake things up. Basically his mandate was to solve the problems in
                    Central America. He called me. I was down in Sfax, Tunisia, giving a speech and
                    he managed to get me on the phone and I remember the conversation very vividly.
                    He said I'd like you to come back and work with me on Latin America and be the
                    principal deputy. I don't know if I want any other deputies or not. We have an
                    opportunity to do some interesting stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And be there in two days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: And be there in two days. I went back about a week later and went back
                    for just a week or two to kind of get my bearings and get vetted by the
                    personnel people in the White House who were vetting all assistant secretaries
                    at this point. Then went back to Tunisia and did my farewells and packed out and
                    went back to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, this was the summer of '81 now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. I was, I came there permanently in June of '81.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this is a very controversial period then as I think
                        one looks back at it. My impression of it. I had worked in ARA in the middle
                        '70s in the policy planning office. Anyway, this is not my story. How was
                        this issue being approached particularly about Central America? Who was
                        telling Enders what to do if anybody and what was he telling you and what
                        did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, it was a very difficult time. In fact of all of my years in the
                    State Department in the Foreign Service, this was probably the most difficult
                    period I ever had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What years?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: This was June of '81 through the end of '82 when I left. So, I was
                    there 18 months. Now in that period we had the civil war in Central America,
                    Nicaragua, the Contras, El Salvador, Guatemala massacres, tremendous violence.
                    Then Allen Ryder who was then a correspondent for the New York Times in Central
                    America described it to me at one point. He said that he had put in for a
                    transfer and wanted to leave. I said, “Allen, why are you leaving?” He said,
                    “Because I'm not going to sit here any longer and watch my friends kill each
                    other.” That's what was going on in Central America. It was just awful. The
                    Sandinistas who had taken control of Nicaragua were viewed by the West and the
                    United States and elsewhere in the world as sort of the reaction to Somoza. They
                    were viewed as the good guys. It became I think very clear very early on that
                    they were not good guys. They had their own agenda and it was just as nasty in
                    some ways as Somoza's agenda. Then subsequently we had the Falklands war when
                    Argentina tried to take back the Falkland Islands. We had the debt crisis in
                    Mexico and it was just one thing after another. I found myself in that office
                    from 8:00 in the morning until 9:00 or 10:00 at night, six days a week. So, it
                    was a very difficult time and a time of some spiritual torment. I have some
                    sympathy for the people who are now working in the Iraq issue for example, the
                    FSOs. You know you are involved in a policy, which is very controversial within
                    your own country. We were invited to occasionally go out and appear on college
                    campuses and make speeches. You did so at some peril. I remember one Saturday
                    afternoon leaving my office and walking into central D.C. just to watch the
                    demonstrations. I was very struck by the similarities between what was going on
                    then and what had gone on just a few years before that on Vietnam. There were
                    many things about the policy I didn't like, I wasn't comfortable with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I didn't think it was all being directed from Moscow and Havana. I
                    thought Moscow and Havana stood to benefit from some of the things that were
                    going on, but I thought basically it was all indigenously based. I didn't make
                    the Sandinistas or the insurgents in El Salvador any better and it didn't make
                    the right in El Salvador and Guatemala any worse. They were bad enough as it
                    was. I guess I accepted that the U.S. because of proximity and interest in the
                    region had to be somehow involved. In the end I think our presence made a
                    difference. I think that the basic decision that we made in '81 to support a
                    process of democratic elections in El Salvador provided the kind of third way
                    for Central America. We worked very hard at that. We brought in election
                    observers and supported a process that had a lot of credibility. Over the next
                    several years long after I had left the scene, elections were the way that the
                    place was eventually transformed or at least pacified. Salvador, Honduras
                    eventually even Nicaragua.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there was sort of a feeling, one was the feeling that
                        bureaucratically a lot of people in ARA were rather mistreated in this deal,
                        on the internal stuff by the attitude of the administration. Secondly, that
                        the U.S. itself was out there really messing around in areas that maybe it
                        shouldn't have been messing around in and doing it in some very devious and
                        dubious ways. That's not my view, but that's a view.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, I know that's a view. Given the context of the time I can
                    understand why some people would have that view. Enders came into ARA. I arrived
                    there three months later and I didn't know many of the people. I hadn't worked
                    in the bureau. They knew me to some extent but only by reputation for my time in
                    EB, but I was greeted as the guy, the savior, the person they would come to when
                    they didn't dare to go to Enders because they were so afraid of him. He was, you
                    know, this guy is six eight and very austere.</p>

                <p>BOSWORTH: No, they had some very talented people. Now, we did recruit some people
                    into ARA for key jobs it turned out for the most part to be very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember for example the case, wasn't there a guy named
                        Jim who was considered a very capable guy and he got sent to Afghanistan or
                        something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Jim was very capable. Well, he was sent someplace, I don't know where
                    he went. Jim's problem was that the republicans, particularly republicans on the
                    Hill, had targeted him during the Carter administration as someone they didn't
                    like. So, that had nothing to do with Enders. That was done right from the White
                    House. There was no way that Enders or I could have protected Jim. I dealt with
                    Jim a lot trying to help him find a place to go and he did finally.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think he went literally to Nepal or Afghanistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: He then came back of course later and he kept his head down for a few
                    years and came back and I think finished as ambassador in Argentina. We brought
                    in people like Craig Johnstone who was not an ARA hand, but came in and became
                    director of the Office of Central American Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't Negroponte an ambassador somewhere in that
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: John was in Honduras.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was also known in ARA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, he was primarily in East Asia. Ted Briggs was an ARA figure and he
                    served for a year as the other deputy who was, well, at the time there was just
                    two of us and then there was just one deputy, me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. Tom brought in somebody, we brought in somebody as an executive
                    assistant, sort of ran the bureau internally. A very smart thing to do and I
                    think it really was much more efficient than the traditional structure. This was
                    a guy who was a fairly senior person. He was basically an administrative
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Tony Gillespie.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Tony used this as a springboard. He then went on and had a very
                    illustrious career and served as ambassador I think twice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within the White House where would you say the intense
                        pressure came from on Central America?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It came to some extent from the president himself although I found
                    Reagan pretty disengaged on most issues. It came from political appointees there
                    who were very conscious of their and others' ideological postures. It came from
                    Bill Casey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to get to that yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Bill Casey. This was the beginning of my relationship with Bill,
                    although I had known him when he was under secretary years before for economic
                    affairs, but Bill was very involved in Central America to the point which I
                    think he basically did some very unfortunate things. He was not honest and
                    straightforward to put it mildly. I read Bob Woodward's book called Veil. It was
                    one of the best treatments I've seen of Casey. He can be a very engaging guy and
                    was very smart and very determined, but very devious and duplicitous. I had to
                    go up with him a few times to testify in closed session before the intelligence
                    committees on the subject of Nicaragua and the Contras. I was very much the
                    second seat at this hearing, but Bill was, he never really misled them, but he
                    was certainly less than forthcoming about what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The initial national security advisor was Richard Allen I
                        guess at the beginning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, I didn't really know him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he engaged do you think in this? In other words, if
                        you stack up, it always seemed to me that if you stack up the amount of
                        attention that was given to this area of Central America versus in a sense
                        what you might call a quantifiable American interest in the area, that there
                        was some kind of huge disproportion between those two things and yet the
                        summaries and it really is an ideological issue as a theological question
                        for some segment, I guess primarily of the Republican party but there
                        probably were some democratic hawks around.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: As in 2001 this time, that time also, a lot of this was a reaction to
                    what had gone before. You remember Reagan came into office and announced himself
                    as loyal to America's friends pointing to what had happened to the Shah in Iran,
                    pointing to what had happened to Somoza in Nicaragua as people who had been long
                    time friends of the United States. We had abandoned them and he said we will not
                    do that anymore. That was part of it. The other part of it was a conviction on
                    the part of many people that this was all being directed from Cuba and there
                    were ties between the Sandinistas and the Cubans, no question. But Al Haig for
                    example used to talk rabidly about the need to go to the source. If you were
                    going to solve the problem with Central America, you had to solve the problem
                    with Cuba. I'll never forget one of the most bizarre exercises I ever
                    participated in in all my years in government. I was the newly arrived principal
                    deputy in ARA. Tom I think was traveling someplace. Haig charged us with
                    producing a set of proposals on what to do with the boat people, Marielitos, the
                    refugees that had come out of Cuba in '78 and '79 who for the most part were
                    really bad people. Most of them were in a federal penitentiary in Atlanta and
                    there was a lot of agitation on the right in the United States to get rid of
                    these people, send them back. So, Haig charged me and the fellow who was the
                    chief of the joint staff in the defense department to come up with proposals for
                    how we could do this. Of course it was a totally bizarre exercise, we were never
                    really going to do it. At one point we came forward with a proposal, which we
                    presented to Haig first, and then he called Weinberger over and we presented it
                    to both of them. It was to take a derelict freighter, shackle these guys inside
                    the hold, put the freighter on autopilot and send it up onto the beach outside
                    Havana. Haig actually said he thought it was a great idea and commended us for
                    our imagination. Weinberger was appalled and then I think Bill Casey may have
                    been there and Casey or somebody from the agency made the point that beach was
                    where the Russians in Havana went to sun bathe Sunday afternoons and maybe it
                    wouldn't be a good idea to have a freighter come roaring in. That was the sort
                    of stuff that was going on there. All the stuff that was surrounding the
                    activities in the Contras and the effort to try to interdict the supply of
                    equipment and arms from Nicaragua that was going into Honduras and going into El
                    Salvador, which was really happening, but the notion of how you would stop this.
                    The agency, a fellow named Dewey Claridge has written a book. Dewey is a
                    delightful rogue and I really enjoyed him, but he would come up with some of the
                    most harebrained schemes. I mean these people all needed adult supervision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later to be a big central figure in the Iran Contra.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Oh, without question. Ollie North was involved in all this.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, there you are and so the Central American thing is
                        being seen through this prism again of East West relations with Cuba as one
                        thing and behind them the USSR, so this is part of the great struggle and
                        it's also I guess a kind of in another way kind of manageable thing. I mean
                        its something that we think we can really put our footprint in. You have all
                        these issues in front of you. When Enders got into it how did he feel about
                        it? Does he really bring himself up to speed on the issues and what did he
                        think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right. He thought as I did that we had to try to find a third way to as
                    I put it earlier that it was feckless to try to win militarily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The third way being in a sense if you had Somoza and his
                        notion on one hand and the Sandinistas on the another, there had to be
                        something in-between.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: There had to be something better than both of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and it might be actually something approaching some
                        semblance of democracy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: We had to find something that would appeal to Ronald Reagan and
                    basically we found elections, democracy. We were laughed at early on, but you
                    know, Enders deserves great credit for having sold this concept within an
                    administration that despite its rhetoric was somewhat hostile to this whole
                    notion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what did they think they could do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They wanted to go to the source and get rid of, you know, cut off the
                    head which was Cuba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you going to do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Damned if I could figure out a way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but I mean if they said that, did someone then follow
                        up and say, well, we have to have an invasion of Cuba?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, that's the sort of thing that they were talking about.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting. You dealt with this in a sense on a country
                        by country issue I suppose. You had a central plan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It was all part of the same problem. Yes. The Guatemalan military,
                    which was just awful, killing guerrillas, killing Indians who were not
                    guerrillas, the massacres in El Salvador. Deane Hinton was the ambassador in El
                    Salvador at that point. I used to get on the phone with him on the secure line
                    once a day and he would tell me the latest horror stories. These people were out
                    of control and yet because we were seen as their not protectors, but at least
                    aligned with them in opposition to the rebels, we were being tagged with their
                    atrocities. It wasn't until we began to see some progress on elections. There
                    was a big election in, let's see it would have been early '82 in which Duarte
                    won.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Napoleon Duarte.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Napoleon Duarte. He won in El Salvador with our strong support for the
                    process. I don't think we got too engaged in the election itself. The process
                    was what was crucial because both the right wing and the insurgents were trying
                    to disrupt the process. Anyway, it was a very difficult, complicated time.
                    Finally Enders got fired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Basically for a memorandum that I wrote with his full support and in
                    fact he asked me to do it. We had been talking for some time about what we were
                    going to do about Nicaragua. The notion that we were going to continue to
                    support these Contras who were coming in and basically outside U.S. direct
                    control, public relations disaster, but on the other hand the Sandinistas were
                    visibly exporting their revolution into the rest of South America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were definitely, they were getting help from
                        Cuba.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They were getting help from Cuba. Cuban military equipment was arriving
                    and they were sending money and weapons into El Salvador, Honduras and
                    Guatemala. Enders went down to meet with the commandants in what would have been
                    the summer of '81 and he in his very blunt fashion said, “Look, we would
                    probably be prepared to let you continue to live and exist here in Nicaragua,
                    but you are trying to export this revolution to other countries and that is
                    something that we cannot allow or cannot live with.” I think it was Ortega,
                    Daniel Ortega said to him, “You don't understand, do you? The revolution is our
                    shield. In other words we have to keep exporting it in order to continue to
                    survive.” It was, we again decided that there had to be a third way and that
                    basically the third way in this instance was to negotiate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you draft up a memo on the Contra question?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, on the question of the Sandinistas really, what were we going to
                    do about the Sandinistas? There was no political support in the United States
                    for putting American troops in there to take them on, no political support for
                    doing anything about Castro and the Contras were visibly backing up in terms of
                    U.S. interests, so we proposed that we begin a process of negotiation with the
                    Sandinistas and try to persuade them that we would give them certain security
                    guarantees in return for their explicit agreement to stop aiding rebel movements
                    elsewhere in the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the memo going to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The memo was going from the Secretary of State to the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Haig agree with that memo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Haig was no longer Secretary. That was when George Shultz was

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he agree with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: He basically agreed with it, yes. This was still fairly early; he
                    hadn't been in office even a year at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it would have gone in effect as a memo from Shultz to
                        the president?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, why did Enders get fired?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Because he was seen as responsible for the memo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shultz was not prepared to go to the mat to defend him at
                        that point I gather?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Not at that point. I mean Tom again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he and Shultz clash?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, not really. I mean I think George had a lot of regard for Tom. Tom
                    had put up so many backs in the White House. Bill Clark, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Bill
                    Casey, Weinberger, all these people just wanted him gone and George Shultz had
                    other fish to fry including issues with the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the memo leaked and then became?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, it just went and when Jeane Kirkpatrick got her hands on it and
                    Bill Clark got his hands on it it just blew up. So, I had already been asked by
                    Shultz to go to another job and sort of that memo was almost my last act in ARA
                    and then I moved to policy planning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me back up a bit, then, what was your impression, did
                        you go to meetings where President Reagan was in attendance? Did you ever
                        talk to him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: My contact with Reagan call came later when I was ambassador in the
                    Philippines and I had to meet with him every time I came back to give him a
                    briefing on what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But your sense of him is that he was just not into the
                        details.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Not into the details.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe we'll talk a little bit more about that later on.
                        What about your sense of Haig as a Secretary of State?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Haig was a very volatile guy who could be charming, but who could also
                    be very confrontational. I have more than once; I had his index finger right in
                    my breastbone. Something had happened that he wasn't happy about, usually
                    stories in the press that he thought that our bureau was responsible for. He was
                    very sensitive to press criticism. On the other hand, he was sensitive in
                    general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Enders ever try to do that to go sideways with the
                        press do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. So, Haig didn't like that kind of stuff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, and of course the entrenched bureaucracy of the State Department in
                    general was suspicious of him. He never really recovered from that famous I'm in
                    charge here and then the White House was sniping at him firstly and wouldn't
                    give him a White House airplane when he needed it. He tried to do shuttle
                    diplomacy on the Falklands issue. Enders traveled with him on those trips from
                    Buenos Aires to London and back and that obviously was not successful. I found
                    him very difficult to work with. I came to know him better in years later and
                    rather like him. I still have a decent relationship with him, but he was very
                    insecure as Secretary of State, very conscious of his position, very sensitive
                    of any insults or jibes at him. The White House was just out to get him. George
                    Shultz then came in it would have been September or October of '81, yes,
                    because, no '82. Shultz was a very different type, very balanced, very quiet.Q:
                    Was Haig, how did you feel about him as an analyzer of issues?</p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Haig had never really recovered from his experience in Vietnam and in
                    some ways being Nixon's close advisor. Haig was among those that believed that
                    basically this whole thing in Central America was being directed from Havana. He
                    had been a young colonel or a young major even in the Pentagon at the time of
                    the Bay of Pigs and still felt scarred by that experience. He was very much a
                    hawk on Central America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was a lot of it being directed from Cuba?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: There was no question that Cuba saw its interests as advanced, but I
                    think fundamentally the problem was indigenous. Unless you were willing to
                    address that, there was not really a hope of solving it and it was, the solution
                    had to be very long term. It involved economic aid, which we managed to get
                    substantial increases in. It involved trying to civilize the militaries in the
                    region. We were partially successful and it involved trying to build democratic
                    institutions.</p>

                        Were you in your job in ARA at the time of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember there being a big debate between some people
                        who wanted to support in effect Argentina because they felt that really they
                        were entitled to have those islands and obviously felt that no the European
                        NATO whole question of relations with Britain, talk a little bit about
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, within Latin America of course there was a great feeling of
                    sympathy for Argentina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Latin American countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right. Within the bureau there was some feeling of sympathies for
                    Argentina, some FSOs who had been spent most of their careers working on these
                    countries. I think Enders and I had sort of the same view which was basically it
                    would be very nice not to have a war, but that in the end if push came to shove,
                    the U.S. had no choice but to support as quietly as possible and without as much
                    as drama as possible, support the UK.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't Jeane Kirkpatrick somebody that was weighing in
                        very strongly on the side of Argentina?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, because she felt a great affinity with the Latin Americans in
                    general. Remember she had been in full praise of the Argentinean military and
                    their government. She was not a constructive influence in many of these
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she know much about Latin America really apart from

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, she weighed in on that side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I remember vividly a meeting Haig had with the Argentinean foreign
                    minister when he had already been to Buenos Aires and come back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm talking with Ambassador Stephen Bosworth. We're
                        talking about the Falkland Island war, which took place, basically I think
                        in the summer of '82 or early summer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Spring, summer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Spring and summer of 1982 and talking about how the U.S.
                        got to its position and what we did I guess in support of the British.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The Argentines never really thought the British would come after them.
                    They thought they were far enough away, 12,000 miles, that the British navy was
                    not what it had been of course and that they would simply make a fuss and then
                    go away. Haig I remember when the Argentine foreign minister was in Washington
                    on this problem and Haig had been in Argentina and had not persuaded them to
                    withdraw. The foreign minister was in Haig's conference room and I was there as
                    sort of a note taker and a backup. Haig said, “Look, Mr. Minister, you have to
                    understand. The British are the most warlike people in the world and you think
                    they're not going to do anything about this. I can promise you right now that
                    unless you withdraw she is going to send her navy and her army after you and
                    they're going to come.” The poor minister was simply disbelieving. He said, “We
                    can't beat them.” Well, of course, 60 days later the British were there and
                    retook the Falklands. We were trying to keep a position, not of neutrality, but
                    kind of quiet support for the British. Many of our Latin American neighbors were
                    very upset about all of this and it strained our relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we provide some Intel or satellite photos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: We did. We did. We provided satellite intelligence. We provided
                    refueling. We provided logistical support and given the history of our
                    relationship with the UK we couldn't have done otherwise. Look at what's
                    happening today as we prepare to act jointly on the subject of Iraq.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. Jeane Kirkpatrick and Bill Clark who was a national security
                    advisor and others would try to get the president into a position so that he
                    would give Mrs. Thatcher a little, but not too much. She of course understood
                    exactly what was going on. She would call on the phone and we would get word
                    that another call, phone call was going to be made.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She called Ronald Reagan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: She called Ronald Reagan and of course he had to take the call, nobody
                    could stop him from taking the call. So, we had prepared these talking points
                    very carefully and give her a little bit of what she wanted, but not everything.
                    Once he got on the phone with her within two minutes his pants were around his
                    ankles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was very fond of her.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: He was giving her everything she wanted. It was really kind of
                    laughable in some ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously the British won in short order and I assume for
                        a period our relations with the Argentineans and other Latin Americans
                        suffered a bit as a result of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Our relations with Argentina suffered although fairly shortly
                    thereafter of course the military government fell. Then we were very actively
                    engaged in helping the Argentineans trying to rebuild a democratic institutions.
                    I got involved with that when I was in policy planning a year or so later.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: We were of course very anti-Castro, there was a great deal of hostility
                    as there is now. Our policy was driven by two things. Driven by an
                    interpretation of Cuba's role vis-�-vis the Soviet Union in the Cold War. It was
                    also driven very substantially by the Cuban American population in the United
                    States. I remember a fellow who had been director of Cuban affairs who was a
                    very able Foreign Service Officer who had gotten crosswise at some people in the
                    Cuban community.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Myles Frechette. When Ted Briggs left as the second deputy in ARA, Tom
                    and I wanted to make Myles the first deputy in his place. Basically the White
                    House said no because the Cuban Americans don't like him. They don't want him in
                    a policy position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always thought it was interesting, you had a huge Polish
                        community in the United States and Hungarians and others which never stopped
                        us from having relations with those regimes. I've often wondered if maybe it
                        was just the fact that it was Castro himself, he's lived so long and he's
                        been in so long that maybe if he had died in 1970 let's say. There was still
                        a communist threat maybe even the Cuban American community might have been
                        able to and therefore, the U.S. government, I don't know whether that. It
                        seems strange when one looks at this, I'm not saying that's my view, but
                        that's a position often articulated that we could deal with everybody else,
                        the Chinese. We could never really normalize with the Cubans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think its been a bizarre policy for 40 years and one very much not
                    fundamentally in U.S. interest. It has, the policy has been highjacked by the
                    Cuban American community certainly in the years since the end of the Cold War.
                    It's very difficult to construct a rationale for continuing to try to isolate
                    the country particularly when we have failed. I think there is a good reason to
                    believe that had we treated Cuba differently that probably Castro would have
                    been long gone. I attribute all of this basically to the power, influence and
                    money of the Cuban American community. They were very strong financial
                    supporters of Ronald Reagan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They themselves, no one could have been able to convince
                        them that in a way it was being more to their interests in a sense to engage
                        rather than just treat Castro as a pariah. Okay, that's interesting. So, you
                        were there about a year and a half. Enders gets fired and what happens to
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, before Enders got fired I was, I'd seen a good deal of George
                    Shultz at various lectures including Latin America and he called me to his
                    office one day. It would have probably been in November and said that he was
                    making some changes in personnel. Paul Wolfowitz who had been director of policy
                    at the time was going to go to the East Asia Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he a career officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No. He had been around government for a long time. He's been actually
                    in the defense department in the Carter administration, but Paul was then in
                    policy planning and Shultz asked me if I would be willing to become director of
                    policy planning.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that because he wanted Wolfowitz out or he wanted
                        Wolfowitz in EA and therefore.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It was not clear. Sometimes George could be obscure about why he did
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean did you get any other sense elsewhere around the
                        building?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think he wanted Paul out of SP, but he definitely did want him in EA.
                    Anyway, I hesitated briefly because of my, by this time strong emotional
                    attachment to what was going on in Latin America both the good and the bad. I
                    remember talking to Tom about it and he said I had no choice the Secretary's
                    asked me to do this, you've got to do it. So, I very quickly told the Secretary
                    I'd be very happy, pleased to move to SP. The last thing I got involved in in
                    ARA, I moved on the first of January, but the last thing I got involved in was
                    Surinam and there was a group of royal military officers that were running
                    Surinam. They rounded up and killed several prominent civilians who had been
                    opposed to the military rule. There was, the agency believed that there were
                    connections between these military guys and Castro or another one of those
                    situations. So, I went off to, I keep getting phone calls about every time there
                    is an election in the Netherlands. I went to the Netherlands on a quiet mission
                    with a general from the White House and met with the Dutch foreign minister and
                    Dutch prime minister with Reagan's personal approval and asked if they would be
                    prepared to join with us in a military expedition to get rid of these guys in
                    Surinam. They said no. They said our public would never support it and we just
                    can't do it. So, I turned around and went home and reported to the White House
                    what their reaction had been and that was kind of my last official act
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What came of that in the end?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Nothing. Eventually the leader was replaced, but they, they were nasty
                    people. It was something that was doable from a military point of view, it would
                    not have been bloodless, but it was doable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was right at the very end of 1982?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you went into policy planning at the beginning of '83
                        and do you think this was because you had had exposure to Shultz and
                        presumably there must have been other people around the building that had
                        you know, I mean had a reputation obviously and all of that would, because
                        it seems unusual to me, I can't think of an instance where somebody has gone
                        from ARA. This speaks again to the general culture of the Department, these
                        peak positions very often are either from Europe or some outsider is brought
                        in or whatever, so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, I think probably Shultz was attracted to the breadth of the things
                    that I had done in the past, the economic stuff and North Africa and ARA. I was
                    kind of surprised that he asked me to do it, out of left field as far as I was
                    concerned. It was a great job, I enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're starting again with Ambassador Stephen Bosworth and
                        when we left off the ambassador was just getting transferred from the Bureau
                        of Latin American Affairs. Okay, so, you're not sure why the Secretary asked
                        you to take this job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, but I'm glad that he did. First of all it got me out of ARA at a
                    very difficult time. In fact, I left ARA in January of '83 and Tom Enders was
                    basically fired in December of '82. I went in January of '83 and Tom had been
                    relieved in December of '82 because of the dispute of how to deal with Central
                    America, particularly how to deal with Nicaragua. So, he went off to be
                    ambassador to Spain and I left and went up to policy planning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who replaced him as assistant secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Tony Motley who had been our ambassador in Brazil. Tony was a
                    non-career personnel person, but very savvy politically and had done a good job
                    in Brazil and was brought back from Brazil to be Assistant Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in the fall of '83?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, this was the fall of '82 and then in January of '83 I went to
                    policy planning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. What was the, well, what was the state of policy
                        planning when you went there? Was there any agenda that they set for
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Not really. Policy planning is a kind of a strange position in many
                    ways because it doesn't have any set agenda or set list of responsibilities. Its
                    role really depends upon what the Secretary of State wants. My predecessor was
                    Paul Wolfowitz. Paul went on to be Assistant Secretary for East Asia. As
                    director of policy planning at that point, the first thing that George Shultz
                    wanted me to do was to bring in some distinguished people from the outside to
                    form sort of a policy planning council and there were five of us with myself as
                    the chair. Then we had a staff underneath us. That was somewhat of a departure
                    from the way policy planning had been organized before. Basically we had one
                    person who was very familiar with the Soviet Union; another person who was
                    concentrating on the Middle East; someone else doing economic affairs, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these people actually on the payroll?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Oh, yes. They were on the payroll. They were senior people with
                    clearances. One of them was another Foreign Service Officer, a fellow named Paul
                    Boeker. Paul had been ambassador to Bolivia and was then out of the Department
                    for a year or two and then came back and came to policy planning. When he left
                    policy planning, he went on as ambassador to Jordan. It was an interesting place
                    to be. The Secretary wanted us to try to look ahead and try to anticipate issues
                    as they came at the U.S. Very difficult to do given the sort of the tenor of
                    foreign policy decision-making. Shultz was pretty good at it in terms of being
                    wiling to dedicate some of his time to consideration of problems that were not
                    yet upon him. That turned out to be a very stimulating place to be. I learned a
                    lot about problems in areas of the world that I hadn't spent much time on
                    including Asia. I was not at all an Asianist before that job. I spent a certain
                    amount of time on the Middle East and on Asia and in the summer of '83 I
                    remember vividly when Benigno Aquino was assassinated in the Philippines when he
                    returned from exile. I didn't have a notion at that point that eventually I
                    would end up going to Manila. Of course, that's the way it turned out. Anyway,
                    policy planning was a good place to be. We didn't have any sort of set area of
                    responsibility. A lot of it involved your success depended upon your ability to
                    work within the bureaucracy to convince other bureaus that your presence would
                    not be negative factors as far as they were concerned, but you could make them
                    better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The sense that I often had, a distance, was that one of
                        the major roles was really speech writing and the preparation of certain
                        kinds of statements for the seventh floor principals. Was that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: We did a lot of speech writing, yes. That was something that we were
                    organized to do and did it fairly effectively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: how did you find working with the geographic bureaus?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It depended. Some of them were very nervous about our presence. Others
                    saw us as an asset. They were always afraid that we were going to second guess
                    them with the Secretary and sometimes we did in fact. That was in part our role.
                    My view was we should try to make things better and not make things worse. So, I
                    always was interested in finding situations where we had expertise and
                    background that could be added to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a clearance responsibility for papers that
                        went to the Secretary from the geographic bureaus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. Particularly anything that had more than implications beyond any
                    single bureau. Again, your ability to see papers that went to the Secretary
                    depended very much on personal relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including presumably your own relationship with the
                        Secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Bosworth: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you think that went?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I had great respect for him. I thought it went well. I was never a
                    personal intimate of the Secretary, but in a professional sense I thought we had
                    very good relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You found him to be pretty impressive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I found him to be very impressive. He was very dedicated to the
                    institution of both the Foreign Service and the Department of State and spent a
                    lot of time thinking about it and working on it and trying to improve its
                    effectiveness. I think probably never before or since has a secretary depended
                    so heavily on the career Foreign Service for senior positions with the possible
                    exception of Kissinger. I think now Colin Powell is depending quite heavily on
                    career Foreign Service. Following Al Haig and Cy Vance and others, this was a
                    new departure for the Department. So, I think morale in general was quite
                    good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any particular dominating issues or
                        questions that you focused on in that job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, we had, we spent a lot of time working on the Middle East. Peter
                    Rodman who was one of the members of the policy planning council had a
                    particular background in the Middle East, but we all spent a lot of time working
                    on it. I remember vividly Paul Boeker and I spent a lot of time working with the
                    government of Israel. Their economy was in a real mess at the time and we
                    recruited a group of outside economists to come in and basically help us assess
                    what should be done with the Israeli economy and make some recommendations to
                    it. This included people like Stan Fisher and Milton Friedman and others
                    probably four or five very prominent economists. One of the conclusions that we
                    came to was that the Israelis, the then Israeli finance minister whose name
                    escapes had the notion that he wanted to basically manage the Israeli economy to
                    limit inflation and create new confidence in the Israeli economic future. I
                    remember a meeting that we had with it would have been I think Don Regan was
                    Secretary of the Treasury then and Shultz and a few other people on this
                    question of whether or not we should allow or encourage Israel to adopt the
                    dollar as the currency for the Israeli economy. They didn't, but the story was
                    leaked prematurely and in fact the Israeli finance minister as I recall was
                    forced to resign. That was one of the things that we were involved in.</p>
                <p>We were also involved in the aftermath of the bombing of the Marine barracks in
                    Beirut and various projects for the Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's an incident that's often talked about even cited
                        today and I guess the question would be what was the mission of those
                        Marines, do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I really have difficulty remembering. I think the mission basically was
                    to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Initially it was to help the Palestinians sort of oversee
                        their departure to Tunisia as I remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, I think the mission really had to do with Syria's occupation of
                    Lebanon. We were there as a symbolic presence designed to encourage the Lebanese
                    to come to some new consensus as to their political arrangements and to try to
                    give at least atmospheric assurance against the spread of terrorism. Also this
                    was after Sabra and Shatila, the refugee camp massacres, the Lebanese rightists
                    who were responsible for with the alleged encouragement of Ariel Sharon, so it
                    was a very difficult time. We clearly, the U.S. was very deficient in what we
                    now call force protection and the Marines were much more exposed than they ever
                    should have been. I remember vividly a horrible time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you spend in SP?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I was in SP about a year and a half. It was cut short because I was
                    asked to go to the Philippines as ambassador. During the time I was in SP, most
                    of that time I was no longer in the Foreign Service. I was a schedule C employee
                    of the Department of State. You may recall there was a provision of law when the
                    new career Foreign Service was established, the Foreign Service Act, which
                    allowed people with a certain number of years of service to retire early before
                    they were 50 or whatever the limit was. If they decided not to join the new
                    career Foreign Service, it was a safety belt for people who didn't want to go
                    into that. I decided for a variety of reasons that I didn't want to join that in
                    the Foreign Service. So, I basically retired, but then was reappointed as a
                    Schedule C employee and when I was in policy planning and then when I went to
                    the Philippines as ambassador I went as a political appointee.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A presidential appointee.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: A presidential appointee, but a non-career presidential appointee. I
                    don't think it made too much difference because everybody still thought of me as
                    career Foreign Service. I must say I sort of thought of myself as a career
                    Foreign Service Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that appointment come about that since you had no
                        real prior experience with Asia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, basically it was because in the law of unintended consequences,
                    Larry Eagleburger who was Under Secretary of State decided he wanted to leave
                    government and Shultz then needed a new under secretary and he decided he wanted
                    Mike Armacost who was then ambassador to Manila to come back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Under Secretary for Political Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: For political affairs. So, Armacost was coming back and then Shultz
                    needed to put somebody in the Philippines. This was of course a very delicate
                    time in the Philippines because these decisions on personnel were all made in
                    January and February of '84 and in August of '83 Benigno Aquino had been
                    assassinated. Our relationship with Marcos was under great pressure both from
                    our own congress and elements in the Philippines. We needed to, I think, there
                    was something of a course correction policy toward the Philippines. So, when
                    Shultz asked me to go out there; the Philippines of course is a very curious
                    place because it is in Asia, but it's not really of Asia in many respects.
                    Someone joked that probably given my experience in Central America I was as well
                    suited to go to the Philippines as anyone could have in terms of background. So,
                    my time in policy planning was relatively brief. I think I was there 16 months,
                    but it was long enough for me to have a flavor of the place and to use that time
                    to get a kind of exposure to the sort of broad sweep of American foreign policy
                    that I had not had the opportunity to do previously.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No. I didn't expect to go to the Philippines. I didn't expect any of
                    that. I was actually at that point looking around for jobs outside
                    government.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It was in April of 1984.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, set the scene then. You arrive in '84 and what's
                        happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, the Philippines is getting ready for national assembly elections.
                    This was the first significant political event since Aquino's assassination. The
                    first electoral process of any note that had taken place since Marcos had lifted
                    martial law, which I think, was done in '81 or '82 or something like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your instructions from the Department going there are what
                        essentially?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Basically to keep the Philippines quiet, don't let it blow up. Some of
                    us saw I think then that Marcos had become a liability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you told to take a particular attitude to him before
                        you went?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: We were distancing ourselves from Marcos and from the Malaca�ang
                    palace. Marcos himself by this time was not well. We knew that, we didn't know
                    exactly how ill. We weren't sure what was wrong with him, but we knew he was not
                    well. There was a political legal process that had been launched after Aquino's
                    assassination in response largely to pressures from the U.S. Congress to try to
                    ascertain what actually had happened and who was responsible. It was a national
                    commission that was interviewing witnesses and laboring away on this subject.
                    This election was scheduled for May of 1984 and was the first time that members
                    of the democratic opposition were allowed to run for office. They were not very
                    well organized. They were quite fractionated. We were intent on creating and
                    helping them to create enough democratic space so that they could organize
                    themselves, campaign and basically bring out the vote. I had to go out early in
                    fact in order to be there when that occurred. My wife and I were planning to be
                    married sometime later in the year, but we learned I was going to the
                    Philippines, we accelerated that process. We were not able to accelerate it
                    enough so that she could go with me in April. I went out in April. I was there
                    for the national assembly elections. I went back to Washington in early June, we
                    were married and we came back to the Philippines in June.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of 1984?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: 1984. The Philippines was a very tense place. Marcos had ruled there
                    since 1965. He had imposed martial law in 1972. He had lifted martial law in the
                    early '80s. There was an unbelievable level of corruption in the country. The
                    military was both corrupt and repressive. The communist insurgency known as the
                    New Peoples Army had begun to attract the attention of Washington intelligence
                    analysts because of their growth. The democratic opposition lacked someone to
                    rally around a number of people who had been active politically before martial
                    law, some of them even during martial law. Corazon Aquino, Benigno's widow had
                    gone back to the Philippines after he was killed, she was there. She at that
                    point was not very active politically other than as a symbol. The economy was in
                    terrible difficulty. It had very little if any foreign exchange. Demand was
                    repressed, depressed. The Philippine businesses were unable to obtain the
                    letters of credit. They couldn't do normal commercial business. It was just not
                    a very easy time for the Philippines and for the U.S. it was not an easy time.
                    Many people had begun to accuse us of having propped Marcos up and having kept
                    him in power. We were trying to distance ourselves from him but not to the
                    extent to which we would bring him down. Reagan was president. He and Marcos had
                    what they considered to be a close personal relationship. I couldn't quite
                    understand that because they had never spent all that much time together. Reagan
                    had been elected on a platform, which included among things the need for
                    American support for longstanding friends. This was after the Shah had fallen in
                    Iran and it seemed to happen after that. Somoza and Nicaragua, so there was a
                    belief deeply held in the Reagan administration that we had to stick with our
                    friends and Marcos was a friend.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the substance of the Jeane Kirkpatrick article
                        that we talked about before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It kind of crystallized.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: But Jeane came to the Philippines in the first two months that I was
                    there and we called on Marcos and had a long conversation with him. I got her
                    together with some members of the democratic opposition as well as other people
                    in the Marcos government. I think she came away with a clear understanding of
                    the complexity of what we were facing and just to say that we supported Marcos
                    was not sufficient. We had to also be supportive of a democratic process. That
                    basically was the horse that we rode in the Philippines for the next couple of
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a riddle that you often find in many countries
                        with which we do business even until today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're there and you're trying to stimulate the democratic

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, I think you try to create and put some pressure on the government
                    and that's what we were doing in the Philippines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: You go in and talk to them. Without being too blatant about it you make
                    it clear that some elements of the American relationship are dependent on their
                    beginning and in this case Marcos beginning to allow more space to the
                    democratic opposition and express concern over the gross extremism on the left.
                    You push for economic reform and end the corruption, etc. All of this of course
                    gave Marcos very much the impression that we were pushing him, we were putting
                    him in a stressful situation which we were indeed doing.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Oh, that was what basically over everything, that the bases at Clark
                    and Subic, remember this was the height of the Cold War and the early years of
                    the Reagan administration. We needed those bases we thought and I think we did
                    to offset a growing Soviet presence in Vietnam. Those were always seen as being
                    very important to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You wanted to keep the American interests intact with the

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the same time, so give me a little bit of a chronology
                        then of how this went. How many years were you ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I was there three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So from '84 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: From May of '84 through that rest of that year. Then we had the
                    national assembly elections, a conclusion of the first phase of the
                    investigation of the Aquino assassination which produced the result that sent it
                    further into the legal morass. Marcos continuing not to be healthy. He was
                    suffering from various things including we now know a kidney malfunction. He was
                    on dialysis and had a kidney transplant in 1985, which did not work. Anyway, '84
                    was relatively calm after the national assembly elections. Then we went into '85
                    and we were putting more and more pressure on Marcos at my recommendation. We
                    were encouraging the political opposition to organize themselves more
                    effectively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Washington was backing you up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Washington was more or less backing us on that. Shultz was backing us
                    very heavily. He saw very clearly that the long term relationship with Marcos
                    had been changed here. Marcos had to change or our relationship had to change,
                    otherwise we were placing our longer term interests in the Philippines at risk
                    because it was not in our interest as having propped Marcos up beyond the time
                    which his own national constituency didn't any longer want him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Pentagon feel about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: By and large they understood. They of course were always very conscious
                    of the need for the bases, but we were fortunate at that point in having some
                    people in the Pentagon who I think were quite clear thinking. One of them was
                    Rich Armitage. He was the principal kind of Pentagon guy in the Philippine
                    account. More and more pressure was mounting on Marcos in '84 and '85. Finally
                    in November of '85 we had had a number of people over there. Bill
                    __________________ had come and then Paul __________________ came out as a
                    special emissary from the president, to basically push Marcos to try to get him
                    to make some economic and political reforms. Marcos didn't really ever evidence
                    much desire to do that. What he did do was to prove that he wasn't well
                    understood so he hired a top-notch republican public relations firm in
                    Washington to present his case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that Hill and Knowlton?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, it was Black, Manafort and Stone. I kept telling Marcos that his
                    problem was not how the message was being transmitted, it was what was in the
                    message. He was not too fond of hearing that. I got along with him during all of
                    that time pretty well. I rather admired him in some ways. I mean he was a man of
                    enormous intellect. The only man in the Philippines I ever found I could sit
                    down and have a kind of global conversation with. He reached a point where his
                    moral compass had gone badly astray. He had no vision of his own life beyond
                    being president of the Philippines. He was not in good health. He was under
                    pressure from his wife and various cronies around him to just keep plunging
                    around him because they knew if he left or if he reformed to any significant
                    extent that they were, their status was very much at risk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think the wife was very influential?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Oh, very much so, but she was always subservient to his decision. The
                    notion of Imelda is a kind of an independent presence; presence, yes, but
                    independent decision making. I've always found difficult that to accept. For
                    example there were those who thought that she was the one responsible for the
                    assassination of Aquino. She and the chief of staff of the armed forces. I never
                    was able to agree with that because it seemed to me neither of them would have
                    dared do that without Marcos' informed consent.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For somebody who was pretty intelligent, that decision to
                        kill Aquino right out in public as he gets off an airplane seems to be
                        somebody's incredible decision.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think the problem that Marcos had by this time he had convinced
                    himself that they could get away with almost anything in the Philippines. I
                    think he honestly thought that he would blame it on the communists and everybody
                    would accept that. They didn't and it was botched. It was not well done.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you're going along through the middle '80s and this is
                        '85 and '86 and how is the attempt to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Finally in the fall of '85 the pressure on Marcos had become quite
                    severe. Casey having been there, [inaudible] having been there, messages from
                    the president all of which I was orchestrating from the embassy. I was
                    continuing to tell him very strongly that he had to allow more space for the
                    opposition, he had to do something about bringing those who most people thought
                    had been responsible for Aquino's assassination, at least have been the agent of
                    that, he had to bring them to justice in incredible fashion. He really couldn't
                    bring them to justice in incredible fashion because that would have cost him all
                    of his support or much of his support that he had within the senior ranks of the
                    military. So, in November of '85, while being interviewed on one of the Sunday
                    morning talk shows on American television, suddenly said, well, I'm tired of you
                    guys pressing me and I'm going to have an election and then I'll show you who
                    really deserves to run the Philippines. He called an election, the so-called
                    snap election. This was in November. The election was scheduled for early
                    February. Corazon Aquino was persuaded by some people in the opposition that she
                    should be a candidate. She and a fellow named Salvador Laurel fought it out as
                    to who would be the presidential candidate. She won and Laurel became vice
                    president. He was constantly besieging me to try to get me an interview with her
                    and persuade her that they should be reversed. The ranking should be reversed
                    and he should be the presidential candidate. The U.S. position in the
                    Philippines was really in a way kind of unique. We were on the one hand in the
                    minds of many Filipinos seen as the great Satan of the West. On the other hand
                    we were seen as the dues ex machina from whom all solutions would come if only
                    we decided that's what we wanted to do. Most of the Filipinos were saying two
                    thoughts in their minds simultaneously. There was a degree of dependence if you
                    will on the U.S. that was very much exaggerated in many respects. People really
                    thought that Marcos was still there because we wanted him to still be. December
                    and January were given to campaigning. The campaign had developed fairly rapidly
                    and was quite vigorous. Marcos himself was not in good health, but he had a
                    tremendous will of his, he was out there on the campaign trail, making speeches
                    and shaking hands. I think from the beginning he thought, he basically thought
                    he was going to win easily. He was out of touch with popular sentiment. I think
                    his fall back was he thought, well, if I don't win I can always cheat enough to
                    win. What he didn't anticipate was that the level of international interest
                    would be as great as it was and the presence of the American journalists,
                    foreign journalists and the various election inspection observation teams that
                    came from the congress and from the civil societies in the country and elsewhere
                    around would be as great as they were. So, his ability to win it by cheating
                    became very constrained. To this day no one really knows who won that election.
                    My belief has always been that she won it probably not by as wide a margin as
                    some people thought, but nevertheless she won it. He, however, then within the
                    week after the elections sort of seized the process and managed through his
                    minions and the national assembly predictably to introduce the vote saying that
                    he had won. Well, that wasn't the end of it contrary to what I think he had
                    assumed to be the case because then the public antipathy began to rise. They
                    didn't just shut up and go back to being a housewife. The opposition became even
                    more vigorous. Because of pressures in our own congress and in our own public,
                    we remained very engaged. We came to the position of pushing away from Marcos in
                    that week or two after the election. There was one, I remember, one statement
                    out of the White House that Reagan was quoted as saying, well, there was
                    probably some cheating on both sides, at which point the Filipinos went nuts. I
                    fired back a message to Shultz and to the White House saying that we couldn't
                    stay on that position. Fortunately over the next three or four days with a lot
                    of heavy lifting from George Shultz the White House issued another statement
                    that said the government had not run a fair election.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would have led Reagan to say that? Were there
                        partisans of Marcos in the NSC or elsewhere in the White House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: There were partisans of a view that we should not abandon our friends
                    and Corey Aquino was a non-entity, unknown and untested and that the democratic
                    opposition in the Philippines was dangerously left and that our presence at the
                    bases would be at risk and that we should continue to back Marcos. Phil Habib
                    who was then retired from the Foreign Service came out as an envoy from the
                    president about a week after the elections when all of this was boiling away; he
                    came out basically to gain us some time. I mean there was nothing he could do
                    other than go around and see a lot of people, which he and I did including
                    Marcos and Aquino. Phil came away from that week convinced that Marcos had lost
                    the capacity to govern and was no longer capable of governing because he didn't
                    have the support of the Filipino people anymore. He went back to Washington to
                    expound that point of view which was the point of view that I was expounding
                    from the embassy. The day he left to go back to Washington was the day that
                    there was this so-called people power revolution in the Philippines that began.
                    Ironically it began because a group of young military officers who were opposed
                    to Marcos had become opposed to it and to their chief of staff had been plotting
                    as we now know Juan Ponce Enrile, the minister of defense and to some extent
                    with Fidel Ramos, the acting chief of staff until Marcos just before the
                    election basically found their innocent.</p>
                <p>Marcos' forces basically knew that these guys were plotting a coup. We knew it in
                    the embassy as well. I had been sending word back to the coup plotters to stop
                    it, not to do it because as much as I thought Marcos should go, I thought it
                    would be in some ways be totally disastrous to have him replaced by a military
                    government particularly. To arrest these coup plotters. They also knew that Juan
                    Enrile, the minister of defense, was involved. That was of course quite a
                    shocker because he really had been a long time supporter of Marcos. This group
                    of colonels and young officers took refuge in one of the military camps out on
                    the outskirts of Manila and [inaudible] called me. This was the first that we
                    knew that this was happening. I was in the residence in my office writing a
                    cable reporting on Habib's and my last conversations with Marcos and others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was about what date now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: This was I think the 21st or 22nd of February, 1986.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1986.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. Then [inaudible] called me and said, we are surrounded. We're
                    holed up and you've got to help us. Well, it wasn't clear to me at that point
                    exactly what we were dealing with. Still I thought it might be at that time was
                    just a military coup. Of course we let Washington know. By this time it was on
                    the airwaves. CNN finally, the first time, had the capability to telecast
                    directly via satellite and they had a cameraman and a reporter in the camp where
                    the military people were holed up. So, I alerted Washington, it was early
                    morning back there. They were watching it on CNN. They knew more about what was
                    happening on the ground there than I did in the embassy because I didn't have
                    access to CNN. That evening I was in contact with Mrs. Aquino's camp and her
                    directly. She had been down in the central Philippines. We were very concerned
                    about her safety and I offered her refuge on a U.S. naval vessel that happened
                    to be in the vicinity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was on your own initiative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. I told Washington afterwards that I was quite confident that they
                    would approve. I had been in contact with her brother who was one of her
                    principal advisors during the political campaign because they were very
                    concerned that Marcos would try to knock her out by basically assassinating her
                    which was not by any means unthinkable. Washington had given its approval with
                    the notion that if at all, if everything else failed I could invite her to come
                    to the embassy residence. I couldn't do that because she was not in Manila, but
                    I did offer her refuge on the ship. She wisely concluded that she didn't want to
                    do that. She didn't want to appear to be under U.S. sponsorship, so she took
                    refuge for the night in a convent and then early the next day came back to
                    Manila. In the meantime Cardinal Jaime Sin had gone on Radio Veritas which was a
                    very small transmitter sponsored by the Catholic church when he learned that
                    Enrile and Ramos and their supporters were in the military camp and he said to
                    the Philippine public that you've got to go help them, take them food. Of course
                    at that point people began to pour out into the streets and once that happened
                    it became clear that this may have started as a military coup, but was much more
                    than that now. She came back the next morning and she sort of took visible
                    control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Aquino?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: This is Aquino. Which was very important because I was very conscious
                    of the need not to be seen as to be putting the U.S. behind a military coup
                    attempt. Since we had by this time pretty much concluded publicly that she had
                    basically won the election, there was nothing wrong with putting our support
                    behind her. For the next two days my role consisted primarily of 1) keeping
                    Washington fully informed and 2) warning Marcos directly on the phone that he
                    should not move by force against Enrile and Ramos in a military camp. He should
                    not do anything that would jeopardize the safety of hundreds of thousands of
                    Filipino civilians who were out in the streets supporting Mrs. Aquino and
                    demanding Marcos' resignation. Finally, over the next couple of days the
                    situation played out so that we issued a statement, the U.S. from Washington,
                    which I then transmitted, to Marcos and others saying in effect the time has
                    come you should leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now that statement, did you in effect compose that
                        yourself and send it back to them for approval or did that come up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I don't remember where it came from. It was a judgment that we reached
                    pretty much simultaneously. I think I was probably out ahead of official
                    Washington in making that judgment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to talk in those days by secure phone to
                        Washington or did you have to keep doing it by cable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The secure phone connections were very bad. In the end we had to do a
                    lot of talking on the unclassified open line because there was no other way to
                    manage communications.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is interesting as you say that CNN at that point really
                        begins in effect this new sort of revolution.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: This was the first one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. So, you get a statement then that basically says that
                        the position of the U.S. government that Marcos should go.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right. The time has come. With that we had removed the sign of heaven
                    from him, the mandate of heaven. He was done. Then it was a question of how to
                    get him out safely.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that? I mean did he immediately say, okay, I'm
                        leaving?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, he didn't say, okay. His first words to me were I'm terribly
                    disappointed. You don't understand. Your government doesn't understand. This is
                    a military coup and I have to resist it. I said, well, we don't agree that it's
                    a military coup any longer. We think that it is something bigger than that.
                    Anyway, these are my instructions. I then got back to him the next day. He was
                    in the palace with his family and his grandchildren. We offered him three
                    alternative routes out. Basically by land and by sea and by air. He opted for
                    the air route and he sent some of his minions and his baggage out by boat. We
                    took him out by helicopter. We took him to Clark where he spent a few hours and
                    then we put him on a plane and he went out first to Guam and then to Hawaii. Of
                    course, he died in exile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the idea of going to Hawaii. It sort of evolved
                        from a discussion process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. There is a big Filipino presence in Hawaii. He knew Hawaii. It was
                    very important to us and to President Reagan in particular that we not allow him
                    to be harassed, that we would give him safe haven basically in the United
                    States, but we wouldn't let him go back to the Philippines. Well, he never
                    really had a complete safe haven because the legal people began coming after him
                    very quickly. Eventually, even after his death they continued to go after the
                    estate. He never went back to the Philippines until after his death.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He leaves and Mrs. Aquino comes to power.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Mrs. Aquino comes to power and a great upsurge of national spirit and
                    good feeling. The U.S. for a time at least was, we were heroes, because we had
                    taken him out. I remember going down to call on her the day after Marcos had
                    left. She was not yet living in the palace. She was in her office in her
                    family's building. As I came out having exchanged statements of good feeling
                    with her and her principal aides, a big crowd of people on the outside all
                    started cheering for the U.S. and me. It was really kind of an extraordinary
                    experience since I previously used to go into my office at the embassy driving
                    through large crowds of demonstrators all saying, Bosworth go home. Some of them
                    had little clips underneath that Bosworth go home saying and take me with you.
                    Filipinos had a sense of humor if nothing else.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize your relationship with Mrs.
                        Aquino in a policy sense and what did you make of her?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I had a very close relationship with Mrs. Aquino in many ways
                    personally of course. It was incumbent upon me just because of circumstances to
                    try to interpret her to Washington and interpret Washington to her. This was of
                    course the normal role of an ambassador, but in this case it was more demanding
                    because she had so little experience. She was a woman of tremendous integrity
                    and great courage and I liked her generally and personally. She liked me and she
                    liked my wife. Her great supporter turned out to be George Shultz. Others in the
                    Reagan administration were less enthusiastic about her and many questioned her
                    ability to run the country effectively. I always considered that she was sort of
                    the mother of the Philippines. Her role essentially was to oversee the
                    reestablishment of democratic institutions. There were missed opportunities. The
                    government was not very coherent. It was torn from the right and from the left.
                    There were great divisions within the government so that particularly in terms
                    of economic policy, there were opportunities that were lost that were not
                    regained until she finished her presidency and Fidel Ramos became president.
                    That was a time of considerable consolidation and forward movement economically.
                    Under her the Philippines became a democracy again with all of its
                    imperfections. She endured numerous military coups because Juan Enrile who had
                    been frustrated by her having taken over the revolution in effect, he never
                    accepted the legitimacy of her presidency and even when he was minister of
                    defense was supporting coup activity against her. She overcame all of that again
                    with strong support from the U.S. That was after I had left. I think the U.S.
                    relationship with her was on the whole very positive. There were things that we
                    did that she didn't like. She did not like to receive what she called gratuitous
                    advice. You had to have a relationship with her in which she would ask for your
                    advice, but just to go down there and tell her what we thought she ought to do,
                    didn't work. Of course Washington's sensitivity to that was not always too well
                    defined. We didn't like the fellow who was then her chief of staff because we
                    thought he was not doing well by her, and we were suspicious of his longer term
                    motives about us. I remember one time I received an instruction in effect to go
                    down and tell her we didn't like her chief of staff and we thought she should
                    get a new one. I simply refused to do that feeling that there were many people
                    around the world who probably didn't like Ronald Reagan's chief of staff, but we
                    would not continuance them telling us to get rid of him. There was a patronizing
                    attitude on the part of some in Washington.</p>
                <p>The President himself, Reagan, never developed much of a relationship with her
                    largely I think because Nancy Reagan had this close relationship with Imelda
                    Marcos and she was never willing to set that aside.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mrs. Aquino becomes president in 1986 then and how much
                        longer did you remain in the Philippines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right. That was February of '86. I left in April of '87.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: April of '87. The base structure agreements and so forth
                        were still in force when you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They were still in force. We began a renegotiation in '89. I had
                    suggested to Washington that we accelerate the schedule for the renegotiation
                    because in my judgment we were never going to be in a better position to do that
                    than we were right after the revolution. But Washington didn't want to do that
                    for various reasons none of which I ever quite understood. By the time we began
                    to renegotiate the rose had faded a bit from the times of the revolution and our
                    support and it proved to be very difficult and in the end the possible
                    negotiation was blocked by a nationalist minority in the senate. She never
                    really sort of leaned in forcibly enough in support of a new agreement at least
                    in the view of those in Washington. That was by that time it was the Bush
                    administration.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little bit about your relationships with the rest
                        of the embassy. Did you feel that you mentioned a little bit about the
                        military attaches, they must have been a significant presence in the embassy
                        I presume?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The attaches were a significant presence, but not as significant as
                    they might have been because we had these huge military establishments there,
                    Clark and Subic. The American commanders there were deputy commanders. Deputies
                    to Filipinos. That was the way it was set up under the previous base agreement.
                    We had extensive connections into the Philippines military and some of them who
                    are defense attaches and one or two of those were quite productive. In fact
                    that's how we learned of the impending coup plotting. In managing the
                    relationship between the two governments I found it much more important to work
                    with the commanders of Clark and Subic. It was always, the lines of
                    responsibility were always quite clearly defined. I was responsible for overall
                    relations with the government that included their relationships with their
                    military counterparts. It worked well. During the crisis it worked particularly
                    well because their presence, the military's presence, their transport and
                    logistical instruments we would never have had otherwise. We had helicopters
                    right there to take Marcos out when it came time to take him out. We had a
                    transport plane to send him to Guam, all of those things. Civil military
                    relations in the embassy and within the American country team were excellent. In
                    fact my wife and I were just two weeks ago down in South Carolina and spent
                    three days with the guy and his wife who worked as the commanding admiral at
                    Subic Bay when we were there. So, we've retained those friendships and I think
                    we trusted one another so we were able to operate in times of crisis with great
                    effectiveness and a minimum of ego involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel you had a good working relationship with the
                        agency people there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The agency people were superb. The agency's relationship with the
                    Philippines was very longstanding. They used to joke that their real problem in
                    the Philippines was that if they recruited somebody within a week that person
                    could not pass a lie detector test because one of the questions on the lie
                    detector test was have you told anyone about your relationship with the agency.
                    They of course as soon as they had a relationship went out and told all of their
                    family and friends because it was an asset socially for them. The agency was
                    quite well informed and worked very effectively with the other constituencies of
                    the American presence there. I had a very close personal relationship with the
                    station chief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little bit about this communist insurgency thing
                        because it seems as if there was a kind of endless insurgency problem in
                        part of the country and is that because without too much of a historical
                        thing on it, but is that because the Philippines themselves cannot figure
                        out a way to solve that problem and what attitude did you take towards it
                        when you were there for example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: There were two kinds of insurgencies. One was the Islamic
                    insurgency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Was that noticeable when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, it had faded a bit by the time I was there. It had been strongest
                    in the '70s and of course, now in the last few years has risen again. That was
                    an insurgency that came primarily out of Luzon and it had its roots and the
                    demands for Philippine Muslims for autonomy. At one time back in the '50s during
                    the Huk insurgency, the government had taken many people from and area which was
                    very overpopulated, and it relocated them where there was lots of land. That was
                    good in one respect, but the problem with it was that it intermingled Christians
                    with Muslims so that it was very hard if not almost impossible to segregate the
                    two communities so that you could give the Muslims much autonomy other than a
                    kind of token autonomy. This had been a dispute that had gone on for a long,
                    long time. Islamic insurgency or Muslim insurrections in the Philippines date
                    back to the arrival of the Spanish in 1523. The other kind of insurgency was
                    much more of a kind of traditional communist insurgency. The so-called New
                    Peoples Army. It was very similar to the way that the Viet Cong had operated in
                    Vietnam. Local organization, building networks themselves throughout the
                    country. Building a military capacity that was basically a guerrilla capacity.
                    Very much targeted against the government as well against the United States, but
                    primarily against the government. Immediately after Marcos left and Mrs. Aquino
                    began to assert herself and do certain things we concluded that Marcos himself
                    had been the best recruiter for the New Peoples Army. Now, it's still there. Its
                    never disappeared entirely in fact I think within the last year or two it may
                    have actually gained a little momentum. There is a long history of rural
                    insurgency, rural violence in the Philippines that goes back well into the
                    Spanish period. It has its roots in poverty, its sense of national injustice and
                    also in the way that the Philippines is organized I think my own personal view
                    socially and politically. There are very few organizations in the Philippines
                    that are organized on a horizontal basis. Loyalties in the Philippines go up and
                    down. They don't go horizontally. The labor movement in the Philippines is not
                    very impressive for example for that reason. Political parties are not
                    ideological parties for the most part for that same reason. Everything is done
                    on the basis of personal relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a client relationship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It is. There's a Filipino phrase for this and it means that you protect
                    people underneath you and people above you protect you and the chain of
                    obligation runs up and down. It does not extend horizontally. I think that
                    that's a reason for the fact that the rule for the Philippines is still not the
                    kind of public order and rule of law that one would like to see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you're there until, well, is there anything else in
                        particular that you want to talk about in your period there? Any
                        issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think just managing the new relationship with her. I remember the
                    embassy country team the morning after she had been inaugurated and sworn in as
                    president. I said, you know, we're all going to look back on yesterday as the
                    end of a fairly easy era in U.S. Philippines relations because one of the
                    positive things about dealing with a dictatorship is that if it is an effective
                    dictatorship it can run the relationship quite effectively. You may not like
                    what it costs, but when we have a problem we can work it out fairly efficiently.
                    Of course, with a sprawling newborn democracy, that was not possible and the
                    relationship was frequently quite messy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you surprised, I mean this isn't strictly in your
                        credo, but were you surprised in effect at how fast in the end the bases
                        went out and that we seemed to have survived their closure? In retrospect
                        how do you think about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. I think, well, I was surprised, but it was not necessarily only
                    because it was the decision that the Filipinos made or we made, there were
                    decisions and circumstances change. By 1989 it became apparent that the former
                    Soviet Union was going to become a former Soviet Union fairly soon. That meant
                    that the Cold War was effectively coming to an end and that the need for us to
                    maintain bases as part of a chain of containment was diminished. Also, Mount
                    Pinatubo erupted and God played some role in this and that eruption made Clark
                    Air Base simply unusable. Then of course the Philippine senate made it
                    impossible for us to save Subic. I think if you would ask the U.S. navy today if
                    they would still rather have something at Subic the answer would be of course.
                    It was a great harbor, very efficiently located, but clearly we've learned to
                    operate without it and there are many Filipinos in fact who still lament the
                    fact that we left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were there for three years? So, your tenure came
                        to an end in the summer of '87 more or less?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: In May of '87.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Is that because the three years were up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No. It was mostly driven by personal considerations. Our children, our
                    blended family of children were back in the States. They were then most of them
                    in the university. Financially I was strapped. My wife wanted to go back. She'd
                    enjoyed the Philippines enormously, but she wanted to be closer to our families
                    and she wanted to go back to school. It was just a sense that three years was
                    enough. In fact, George Shultz didn't want me to leave. As it turned out, he put
                    somebody in there who was very effective, Nick Platt, who was my successor. He
                    tried to persuade me to stay and I stayed for a few more months, but that was
                    enough.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you leave in '87 and you had already in effect retired
                        from the Foreign Service. So, then what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. Then I came back here and Dartmouth College where I had graduated
                    offered me a fellowship for a few months and we went up there. I did some
                    writing and some speaking and some lecturing on campus. I looked around for a
                    job and I finally settled on a position with the U.S. Japan Foundation in New
                    York. I had considered briefly going to California. I had a job offer out there,
                    but we decided to stay on the East Coast because again most of our children were
                    here. I went to the U.S. Japan Foundation in New York. We moved from Hanover,
                    New Hampshire down to New York and Connecticut. I ended up staying there from
                    '88 to '95.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the Japan Foundation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The U.S. Japan Foundation, which is a private grant, making
                    institution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where does it get its funding from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It had a major gift from a very prominent and very controversial
                    Japanese back in the early '80s. His name was Ryoichi Sasakawa. It was given to
                    a group of Americans, so it is an American institution organized under American
                    law with a lot of independence. We were giving away five to six million dollars
                    a year when I was there. I learned a lot about Japan and traveled extensively in
                    Japan and elsewhere in Asia. That in many ways is how I became more of a
                    specialist on Asian issues. I was engaged in a number of task forces, the
                    Carnegie Endowment, the Century Association. I was also doing quite a bit of
                    consulting for private companies. I was on a couple of boards. I taught as an
                    adjunct professor at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia
                    for four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you're there until '95 and then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Then I was asked by some former colleagues in the State Department if I
                    would take on the task of organizing and running the institution that was being
                    created to implement the U.S. agreement with North Korea called the Korean
                    Peninsula Energy Development Organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Say that again, the Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, known as KEDO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. So you were asked to take that on and you do
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I did it. I wasn't eager to do it at first. In fact I spent six months
                    working for them half time and working for the U.S. Japan Foundation half time
                    because we had an apartment in New York which was owned by the Foundation and a
                    house in Connecticut that we owned. We had a pretty good life and the U.S.
                    government was in effect asking me to jump off a cliff because this was a new
                    organization. It didn't exist. I was the first employee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about that position. Where did that whole thing
                        come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, there was a so-called agreed framework between the U.S. and North
                    Korea in 1994 whereby they agreed to freeze their nuclear weapons program and we
                    agreed to give them in return alternative energy supplies including heavy fuel
                    oil and two light water reactors. KEDO was set up by the U.S., South Korea and
                    Japan to implement that agreement basically to build nuclear reactors in North
                    Korea. At a certain point I decided it sounded like a life experience that I
                    shouldn't pass up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was going to be funded by?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Funded by those three governments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including the government of South Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, and so, but they were going to put it in the
                        framework of in effect a corporation that was a quasi-governmental?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It was an international organization. It was sort of like an
                    international consortium and it had a commercial task to build these reactors.
                    Yes, it was an international organization recognized by the UN, but a
                    specialized international organization. We had no offices. We had no staff. We
                    had no nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was it that came to you and asked you to do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It was Bob Gallucci.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had negotiated the agreement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: He negotiated the agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The agreement, right and the purpose of the agreement was
                        to try to keep the North Koreans in effect from developing an independent
                        nuclear weapons making capacity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right. Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: That story of course is still on hold.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's why this is a most.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: So, I agreed to do it, but I said I can't do it full time until I'm
                    more confident than I am now that this is actually going to be a permanent or
                    semi-permanent institution. Very soon the governments of South Korea and Japan
                    assigned two senior diplomats to this enterprise as my deputies and we begin to
                    set up this organization. We found office space in New York and began hiring
                    support staff and receiving people who were coming in from the three governments
                    who worked for us. Then we had to negotiate an agreement with the North Koreans
                    which became, which was a more detailed version of the agreed framework from
                    Geneva which stipulated what kind of nuclear reactors we were going to build and
                    how we were going to build them. The Korean Electric Power Company, known as
                    KEPCO became our prime contractor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that the North Koreans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: South Korean Power Company. The national power company. We hired Duke
                    Engineering as our technical consultants and spent the first four months
                    negotiating an agreement with North Korea which proved to be a very arduous task
                    and very difficult, very complicated, but fascinating because I learned
                    something about the North Koreans and how they negotiate.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: First of all their negotiators have very little room to maneuver.
                    Everything comes from and goes back to the very top. These are people who live
                    on the edge of crisis all the time and they're very comfortable there.
                    Brinkmanship is in their bones. Yet they're not very effective negotiators. If
                    you learn how they operate and how patient and don't need an agreement within
                    any given time schedule, you could usually do very well with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go to North Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I went to North Korea when I was with KEDO twice. Once in the fall or
                    in the spring of '96 and then again in the summer of '97 just as I was leaving
                    KEDO.Q: Okay, we'll come back to that, so you started there about when did you
                    say?</p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I started in July of '95.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '95 and you were there until the summer of '97
                        approximately.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It was there until October of '97.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, so the summer of '95 until October of '97 and you're
                        getting this thing started and you're trying to negotiate. Now, did the
                        North Koreans, did you feel in essence that they did want to do this, that
                        they wanted to go through with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Oh, I think there's no question then at that point that they wanted to
                    go through with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The reactors were to be paid for by this consortium? In
                        other words all the money was coming from this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. They were just receiving this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Plus the heavy fuel oil.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Plus the heavy fuel oil.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was for them to run power plants as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your sense is that they were as much as one can tell, that
                        they wanted to do it and did you think, were there inspection mechanisms on
                        the nuclear fuel side to make sure that they weren't doing something else
                        incorrectly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, that was one of the things that we had to negotiate, but the IAEA
                    had been brought in as a result of the agreement in Geneva the agreed framework.
                    They had come in in October of '94 to monitor the freeze of the North Korean
                    facilities at Yongbyon. Their inspectors were onsite.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was a freeze not a dismantling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Not a dismantling. The dismantling was scheduled to take place
                    subsequently after we had made progress in certain definitions of various stages
                    of completion of the nuclear reactors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're getting this thing set up and you're getting going
                        in your negotiating and how far did you get by October of '97 would you
                        say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: We had negotiated the supply agreement. We had negotiated a number of
                    protocols supplementing the supply agreement, governing our privileges and
                    immunities in North Korea, our specifying the site and how it was going to be
                    developed. We'd gotten quite a ways, but we didn't have much money because the
                    governments had not yet appropriated large sums, so we were sort of getting by
                    on a wish and a prayer by scraping by. We had started the task of site
                    preparation in the North, the site was a place called Kumho, which was on the
                    northeastern coast of North Korea, and we had taken it over. We had the presence
                    there of the South Korean contractors were there. They had people there. We
                    began to create basically a village, which our people lived in and worked
                    in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there fuel deliveries?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Fuel deliveries were proceeding. We never had enough money for that
                    either. The political reality is that within about a week after the U.S. and
                    North Korea signed this agreement the republicans gained control of the U.S.
                    congress and the conservative branch of the republican party hated this
                    agreement because it was seen as basically submitting to North Korea and its
                    forces. So, there was a strong determination from the beginning to kill this
                    plan. The Clinton administration was not prepared frankly to invest all that
                    much political capital in keeping it going or at least not prepared to invest
                    much political capital in extracting money from a congressional process. So, we
                    were on a wing and a prayer constantly in terms of our ability to finance the
                    purchases of heavy fuel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the money come from the Japanese and the South
                        Koreans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, the agreement among the three governments was that the U.S. would
                    take care of the heavy fuel oil. The Japanese and the South Koreans would take
                    care of the nuclear reactor costs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: how much money were we talking about for the heavy fuel
                        oil approximately?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Approximately, well it varied depending on what the market was doing,
                    but it was anywhere from $60 to $100 million a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Presumably that would be money that would be spent with
                        American corporations for this oil?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: We did it through international tender on the international market.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting. Do you think that was a mistake perhaps, that
                        it might have generated more political oomph?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I don't think so. In global terms this was literally a drop in the
                    bucket.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But still hard to get out of congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, not for economic reasons, but because they hated the
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have felt that in one sense you can characterize
                        it as blackmail, but on the other hand what is the alternative I guess?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: That was always my question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have felt that therefore it was a desirable thing
                        otherwise why would you be working there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, I thought it was a very good job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a good job before you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. I didn't ask for this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, right, no I understand. I mean did the republicans,
                        did you ever meet or talk with any of them? What was their alternative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They didn't have one either except some may have had the alternative of
                    basically bombing North Korea and taking out their nuclear facilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but obviously after 9/11 you're more alive to these
                        issues, were they alive to the notion that the North Koreans could produce
                        nuclear material and start selling it on the black market to people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think they were conscious of that. In fact remember in '93 and '94
                    there was a great atmosphere of crisis over this issue on the Korean
                    Peninsula.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is why then sent Gallucci there I suppose to
                        negotiate something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Gallucci was the negotiator and that's why Jimmy Carter went there and
                    there are those who think that Carter's visit averted war. We're now revisiting
                    this thing for the second or third time. We've been through all of these issues
                    before.</p>

                <p>BOSWORTH: We were getting some money from the U.S. congress. We were getting the
                    Defense Department to reprogram some funds. We had negotiated a line of credit
                    from the Japanese. They had a line of credit of 15 million dollars, which we
                    would draw down and then pay back when funds came in from other sources, but
                    basically the money came out of the U.S.</p>

                <p>BOSWORTH: 500,000 metric tons per year.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, we met it. We were a little late. We would stretch the year a bit,
                    but we were meeting it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The North Koreans in principle should have been satisfied
                        on that particular score?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, I don't think that there was ever, they never became too upset
                    about that. I mean I think they were conscious that we were making a good faith
                    effort to deliver on schedule and if we slipped a month or two, not a big deal.
                    I think the reality is that the North Koreans never saw this as just an energy
                    agreement. That wasn't why they did it. They saw it as an agreement aimed at
                    bringing about a normalized political relationship between them and the U.S. It
                    was that that they were disappointed. The Clinton administration until the very
                    end didn't seem willing to take any political risk to try to bring that
                    resolution about and then of course when Bush became president he was adamantly
                    and flatly opposed to trying to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did Mrs. Albright stand in that? Was she willing
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: She didn't really get energized on this issue until the fall of '98. By
                    this time I was in Korea as ambassador when various things happened that
                    basically called her credibility into question. She then began to be more
                    interested in Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it President Clinton himself I mean did this issue get

                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I don't think the issue got to him much, but that's no excuse. What
                    happened, the one constructive thing that happened was the North Koreans fired a
                    missile off over Japan and that got everybody's attention. Then there was a
                    suspicion that we found another nuclear related activity elsewhere in North
                    Korea and Mrs. Albright was very embarrassed by a very hostile reception in one
                    of the congressional committees. What really happened was we got Bill Perry to
                    come back as a special envoy to do a policy review and he produced a series of
                    recommendations that basically got us back on track with the North Koreans but
                    more importantly with the South Koreans and the Japanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the South Koreans and the Japanese sort of agree that
                        this should be the first step of a framework toward more normalized U.S.
                        North Korean relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, but they also wanted, well, their primary objective was stability
                    on the Korean Peninsula.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The South Koreans were very determined to try to deal directly with the
                    North Koreans which of course the North Koreans at that point didn't want to
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Because that would convey a sense of legitimacy to the South Korean
                    government, which they had never accepted. It wasn't until Kim Dae-jung became
                    president in 1998 that South Korea began the so-called sunshine policy, which
                    they began to try to charm the North Koreans into a dialogue, which eventually
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it foreseen at the time in 1994 when the framework was
                        negotiated that somehow there might then be a series of steps between the
                        Americans and the North Koreans to continue but you feel with the change in
                        the congressional thing that that suddenly sort of was all frozen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Sure. There was discussion. There was a provision for ending the
                    sanctions, economic sanctions, establishment of diplomatic liaison officers, all
                    sorts of stuff that the North Koreans expected we were going to move on. Now,
                    they were their own worst enemies in many respects because we had North Korean
                    submarines washing up on South Korean coasts. We had various incidents taking
                    place that earned them the enmity of everyone.</p>

                        to be involved no one wished to really take that on the American side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're delivering the oil, but I suppose did you get the
                        sense by October of 1997 that the North Koreans were becoming disillusioned
                        even then because they weren't seeing anything else coming or at least by
                        then it was still going along?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It was not that visible if they were discontented. They constantly
                    harassed you and hectored you, about not doing things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Meanwhile the preparations are going forward to

                <p>BOSWORTH: That's right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happens to you then personally at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I got a call from Sandy Berger in April of '97 asking if I would be
                    prepared to go to Korea as ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that come kind of out of the blue for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It came very much out of the blue as far as I was concerned. I had not
                    looked for it and was not that eager to do it initially. I talked to my wife and
                    we both become enthusiastic. She was particularly enthusiastic right from the
                    beginning. Our time at KEDO had given her certain contacts with South Koreans.
                    She liked Korea a lot and I think she could envision herself as living there. I
                    went back to Berger and said okay, we'll do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was basically since your earlier, your last embassy
                        had been a republican administration, so do you feel you were seen as a

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Just before we get to that, you took a couple of

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It's an awful place. It's desolate, barren, sterile. You really have a
                    sense of being dropped off the face of the earth in the 21st Century, very
                    repressed, hillsides are all barren because they've burned all the wood, lots of
                    erosion, an economy that was visibly not functioning. Smoke stacks that don't
                    have any smoke coming out of them.</p>

                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes.</p>

                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The most senior person I met when I was there was a deputy foreign
                    minister who was seen by everyone as being the de facto foreign minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a sense of a person at that level that you
                        were dealing with somebody who had shall we say wide views?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, wide views, but very narrow objectives.</p>

                <p>BOSWORTH: Being the survival of the regime. The man I dealt with most was an
                    ambassador at large in the foreign ministry who was my counterpart.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With Ambassador Stephen Bosworth. Today is the 3rd of
                        April. We have been talking about the ambassador's involvement with Korean
                        affairs and just to start I want to ask sort of a general policy question,
                        which is as follows. You had said that when the congress changed in 1994 and
                        the republicans came in as a majority that the Clinton administration became
                        much less inclined to take political risks in connection with its policy
                        toward North Korea. I may not be characterizing that correctly and of course
                        you have the chance to correct obviously. One of the things that strikes me
                        is that if you think in the broadest terms about the formulation of foreign
                        policy, on how things get done, that it's often a mix of domestic American
                        interests and then the people that are actually professionally working on
                        the policy and those things can come together in all kinds of different ways
                        for each issue that comes up. I'm surprised a bit about North Korea because
                        I wouldn't have thought that there would be much domestic political interest
                        at all in North Korea. That there would be probably no economic interest,
                        but very few people in the United States probably pay much attention to or
                        care much about it. So where would the political dynamics of interest be in
                        this question for example of the initial agreed framework where we were
                        going to deliver the oil and the South Koreans and the Japanese were going
                        to assist with the development of nuclear power plants? In a sense who would
                        be opposed to this and why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, I think people were opposed to it whose world view was such that
                    they considered any kind of dealing with North Korea or any other government
                    that seemed prepared to use some form of blackmail as succumbing to that
                    blackmail. They viewed North Korea as using their nuclear threat as blackmail
                    against us and thought it was morally weak of us to succumb to that. You're
                    right. I don't think there was a strong high level of interest around the
                    country in this. North Korea seemed a very distant threat in those days. It's
                    not quite so distant now. I think people are beginning to understand why it's a
                    cause of concern. I think first it was this question of not wanting to appear to
                    be succumbing to blackmail. Secondly, it was the rising even then, rising
                    antipathy within the republican peaty particularly on the conservative wing of
                    that party to the Clinton administration, which was seen overall as being
                    morally bankrupt and weak. Basically almost anything that the Clinton
                    administration proposed these people were going to fight. After the
                    congressional elections in '94 they had much more influence because they control
                    to a very great extent the outcome of the congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Take up this question just for a second. You obviously,
                        you took this job with this new agency so you must have felt that its goals
                        were desirable. So, how do you answer this statement that this is somehow a
                        type of blackmail?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think you have to look at what the alternatives are and those are the
                    same alternatives we face today. The agreed framework was in effect the
                    beginning of the first effort to try to engage with North Korea to bring them
                    out of their isolation and to tie them more firmly into the rest of the world in
                    the belief that that would tend to stabilize the situation. It would then
                    acquire interest or a stake in behaving reasonably because if they didn't they
                    would begin losing benefits. The alternatives to that are pretty bleak. One, we
                    can do what we periodically tried to do and that is ignore North Korea and sort
                    of wait for it to collapse because it is obviously a pathetically weak state in
                    many respects. The problem with that is it has not collapsed and we I think
                    should realize that as the regime senses that it might collapse it's going to be
                    increasingly desperate in its behavior and its desire to attract our attention
                    to engage with us because of things it wants and needs. The other alterative of
                    course is to resort to military force and because of the proximity of Seoul and
                    the configuration of forces along the demilitarized zone the use of force is not
                    a very attractive option because the North Koreans retain the ability to do
                    devastating damage to South Korea, particularly metropolitan Seoul. This is not
                    the South Korea of the 1950s. This is now a South Korea that is the 12th largest
                    economy in the world so that a conflict on the Korean Peninsula would not only
                    bring untold human destruction, but it would also give a devastating blow to
                    regional and global economies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You feel then that if you're trying to put a balance up
                        that in a sense trying to engage them in this way is the lesser of many
                        unpleasant choices.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Exactly. I mean I, you know, none of us like the notion of having to
                    deal with a government like that in that way, but the world is a collection of
                    various shades of gray. Very few problems in international affairs can vend
                    themselves to a black and white analysis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you took up the job of being ambassador in South
                        Korea and you were in this other role, did you have a chance to try to
                        engage people on the right in this country in any substantive way, serious
                        conversations on the subject or is that possible?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I gave a number of interviews. I did a number of speeches to various
                    interest groups in Washington, New York and elsewhere, so yes, I was speaking
                    for the concept of KEDO. I was speaking for the concept of building cooperation
                    with our key allies on problems that were a concern to all of us. That was one
                    of the other aspects of KEDO that I found attractive and that I thought might
                    provide something of a model for how the U.S. and our allies and friends would
                    organize ourselves to deal with this sort of regional security threat other than
                    on a giant alliance basis like NATO or other than unilateral which is the way in
                    Asia we had customarily worked. I thought this was a good model and something
                    worth experimenting with.</p>

                    <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you really didn't feel I take it that you were able to
                        make much headway in the intellectual competition or the argument with the
                        right on this particular topic? Not that you didn't try.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Not at the time although there was one powerful argument that did have
                    an effect and that was that because of the agreed framework what we knew North
                    Korea could do at the site, the nuclear site at Yongbyon was frozen under the
                    agreement. We had forced all of North Korea's production of enough plutonium to
                    produce probably over an eight year period that it was enforced probably almost
                    100 nuclear weapons. That was a considerable accomplishment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the North Koreans getting technology from outside to
                        do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They were getting some. I mean they'd had access to some technology
                    from the former Soviet Union back in the '80s. Then as now of course evidence
                    that's being discussed in the newspapers and we knew at the time that there was
                    collaboration between North Korea and Pakistan. Each had something the other
                    wanted. North Korea presumably had the techniques available how to weaponize
                    nuclear material and North Korea had a fairly sophisticated medium range missile
                    program. So, this was a meeting of different, but related capabilities. We still
                    don't know whether in fact North Korea actually produced any nuclear weapons.
                    We're not even 100% certain that they extracted plutonium, which was not
                    reported to the IAEA. It's quite likely in my personal judgment, but that's not
                    quite the same as saying we know to a certainty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you said earlier, sometime in early 1997 you got a call
                        from Mr. Berger who was I guess the?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: National security advisor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: National security advisor. Was it at all meaningful that
                        the call came from him and not from someone in the State Department for
                        example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I suppose yes that it was because basically it reflected a level of
                    interest within the executive branch that I do this. If I'd just gotten a call
                    from the office of personnel in the State Department I might not have responded.
                    I had had offers or requests from the Department over the preceding ten years to
                    do various things some of which I had been willing to do, but did not involve a
                    full time firm reentry into the State Department, but a couple of
                    ambassadorships that I was not interested in doing. This one struck me as
                    different.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that the main interest in that, I mean
                        leaving aside your own abilities obviously, was because of your familiarity
                        of this North Korean nuclear issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think they were looking for someone who had some experience in
                    dealing with Koreans. I'd had a lot of experience dealing with South Korea and
                    with North Korea. It was my work with the U.S. Japan Foundation that brought me
                    into contact with Northeast Asia in general. So, they were looking for someone
                    who was an experienced ambassador, who had done it before, who would come across
                    in Korea in particularly, South Korea as being a serious appointee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About what time did you take up the job as ambassador in
                        South Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I arrived out there in November of '97 and then of course it was just
                    as the financial crisis was cresting in South Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any contention during your confirmation hearing
                        on the North Korean subject?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No. I kind of sailed through. The confirmation process has become a
                    little scary over the years because of the way it works. At least I found it
                    different from the last time I had done it which was when I went to the
                    Philippines in '84. There is no one in the executive branch who sort of at
                    least, there didn't seem to be anyone, sort of offers comfort and consolation
                    and guidance as you work your way through this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Doesn't the bureau do that for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It's a very complicated system. To a very limited extent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really?</hi>
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I didn't in my case. I was never terribly concerned, but in effect
                    given the disclosure requirements now it's a little bit analogous to being asked
                    to strip naked and stand up on a platform in the public square and let people
                    look at you. It's not a comfortable process to go through, but in my case it
                    went fairly uneventfully.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You arrived in October? That's a topic by the way that I
                        might come back to later on. You arrived in October of '97 and what kind of
                        instructions did you have from the United States government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: First, I arrived there just as the financial crisis was raging. I had
                    had consultations in Washington and it was going very rapidly. I went to the
                    APEC summit in Vancouver en route to Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: APEC being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. President Clinton was there. I
                    did not have a meeting with him independently, but Larry Summers was there. He
                    was then deputy secretary of Treasury. He and I had a long discussion about what
                    was going on in the Korean financial system and globally because we were by that
                    time very concerned that Korea was in a position where 1) it could go into
                    default and threaten the stability of the international bankers system and 2)
                    that economic difficulty could prejudice the security arrangements. When I
                    arrived in Korea in November, my mandate really was to try to do everything I
                    possibly could to help stabilize the financial system and that was consuming
                    interest for almost the first year I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I was basically working very closely with the key Korean ministers. The
                    new president once he was elected, Kim Dae-jung, the deputy prime minister for
                    economic affairs and various other economic ministers trying to insure that they
                    complied with the agreement that they had established with the IMF. Then very
                    importantly working with both Bob Rubin and Larry Summers back in Washington to
                    insure that they understood what was happening in Korea and to bring from them
                    insights into the Koreans as to how to deal with the financial crisis. We were
                    instrumental in helping them reschedule their short term foreign bank debt, a
                    whole series of major steps that were key to their being able to survive
                    financially. The interesting thing about all this of course was that I did this
                    virtually with no written instructions and in fact with only limited guidance
                    from the State Department because my principal interlocutors in Washington were
                    Rubin and Summers and the Treasury Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the State Department, should the Department have been
                        involved in that and if you had been back in EB would you have been more
                        involved in a sense than you felt the Department was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I would have been. I would have certainly tried to be more involved and
                    I think the Department in some instances was trying to be involved, but this
                    really, the die had been cast for this during the Mexican commercial crisis a
                    few years earlier when the president, the White House gave direct authority over
                    this to the Treasury Department and State over the years has come to be a far
                    less significant player in international economic issues than it was when my
                    generation of people were active.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that because State was weak or because they were just
                        in a sense outmaneuvered?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It is a situation in which having less authority means that over time
                    you become less capable. The State Department responsibility of international
                    trade area was very weak, much weakened in the late 1970s. It went through
                    Treasury and to STR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Special Trade Representatives.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right. State's role was very limited. State was the object of great
                    suspicion within particularly the congress because it was believed, I think,
                    falsely that in our efforts of international economic issues we were so
                    concerned about the feelings of our foreign constituencies that we gave short
                    shrift to American interests. I don't think that was true at all, but in any
                    case the result over a period of a couple or several administrations there had
                    been a profound weakening of the State Department's role in most of these
                    issues. In a time when we had to react very quickly and with great agility,
                    there was no time to get written instructions out from Washington. I remember
                    the first couple of days I was there the embassy sent back a couple of long, not
                    long, but pertinent messages about what was happening within Korea. I called the
                    Treasury Department, Larry Summers, whom I had known previously and I asked him
                    if he had seen these messages. He said, you're got to understand, we don't work
                    on the basis of written messages. They're too slow and unwieldy. We work here on
                    the basis of an occasional e-mail, but more importantly all communication,
                    telephone calls. If you have anything that you think Bob or I would need to
                    know, pick up the phone and call us. From then on that's what I did and still
                    even now the result is that the sort of the archival record of what was done
                    during that period is very lean, with very little in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is how we'll find out. Tell me, give me a quick
                        snapshot of the situation as you arrived in Korea then economically.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Korean foreign exchange reserves were running down rapidly. They
                    probably had less than a week's requirements. The public was in a panic.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This had happened why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: This had happened basically because Korea in terms of international
                    finance was borrowing short and lending long. They were borrowing money from
                    foreign banks, turning around and Korean banks were lending the equivalent of
                    that out to Korean companies at a long term basis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this because there was no analog of the Federal Reserve
                        to control the thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: First of all, there was inadequate supervision of Korean banks.
                    Secondly, Korean companies were very much overleveraged. They had tremendous
                    debt to equity ratios which is unsustainable. By this time, by November this had
                    become very visible that there had been a financial crisis in Thailand. It was
                    very difficult in Indonesia. The Asian financial crisis was in full swing. In
                    the case of Korea it happened very quickly. In late September the IMF had a
                    mission out there and came back and said Korea is in okay shape, there's no
                    problem. I went over to Treasury in October when I was getting ready to go to
                    Seoul and asked about the Korean financial situation. I was told by senior
                    people at Treasury then, we're not worried about Korea. We're worried about
                    Thailand and Indonesia. Within three or four weeks this crisis had spread very
                    much into Northeast Asia and into Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They're running out of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They're running out of foreign exchange. As loans came due the banks
                    were not rolling them over again; they were pulling them back. The public was in
                    panic. Also, Korea was in the last few weeks of a presidential electoral
                    campaign and a lot of feeling in Korea, one of my concerns was that Koreans
                    would begin to look for an external villain to blame for this problem. There was
                    a tendency briefly in that direction, but with the election of Kim Dae-jung the
                    Koreans managed to pull themselves back together pretty quickly. I think our
                    support for them in this period was very important.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: That consisted of being willing to provide some emergency liquidity
                    from the Treasury Department.</p>

                <p>BOSWORTH: No. Congress is not happy about this and we in the end didn't have to
                    use it, but it was a psychological step that was very important because it
                    helped to restore confidence internationally if Korea was going to be able to
                    meet its obligations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. You work with the exchange stabilization fund. The
                        IMF comes in presumably prodded at some length by the United States to
                        provide some kind of liquidity or some kind of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, the IMF came in with a major agreement eventually. The IMF
                    arrived about the same time as I did and very quickly put together their first
                    IMF program or IMF agreement which was signed I think before the 5th of December
                    of '97 and which frankly did not work. It did not restore confidence. The run on
                    the Korean foreign exchange reserves continued. We then did a second agreement
                    or the IMF did with strong encouragement from us. It was signed on Christmas
                    Eve. That agreement worked. The currency began to strengthen. The Korean won had
                    depreciated by almost more than 100% at this point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the essence of that one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The essence of that one and the reason that it worked was not so much
                    the requirements that it laid on Korea to do things, it was more that it
                    frontloaded much of the liquidity that was going to be available so that
                    international market looked at that and said well, if they're going to have that
                    much money available, this was a 58 billion dollar bailout or a confidence
                    restoring program of which the Koreans didn't draw all of it. They didn't draw
                    the portion that we had committed. They did draw from the IMF and the World Bank
                    and from the Asian Development Bank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have they paid any of that back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They paid it all back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They did? That's amazing. You were presumably dealing then
                        at the most intense levels and at the highest levels of the Korean
                        government I take in this period?</hi>

                <p>BOSWORTH: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any of these people you had known before or met?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No. A few, but not very many.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have trouble in the beginning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, I didn't. I mean they were so desperate they clearly were looking
                    for advice. I was fortunate enough to have had some experience and exposure to
                    these issues over my time in the Foreign Service and to some extent while I was
                    out of the State Department. I was able I think to communicate on subjects for
                    the most part a lot of people find rather arcane and complicated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting. In other words, you were not selected in
                        a sense with the Korean financial crisis in mind and yet you did have this
                        background.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, not at all. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, how long did that crises preoccupy most of your
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, it preoccupied me for most of the first year I was there which
                    would have been most of '98. In the second half of '98 security issues began to
                    crowd in on us. It was in August of '98 that the Koreans, the North Koreans
                    fired their long range missile out over Japan into the Pacific Ocean. That of
                    course was a major event. It was in that same period that Kim Dae-jung, the
                    president of South Korea, began outlining publicly his so-called sunshine policy
                    and it was at that time we made a visit to the United States and spoke with a
                    joint session of congress, laid out his program and so on. Actually for most of
                    the time I was there these financial and economic issues were big requirements
                    on my time. The security issue became increasingly important as we went through
                    that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you deal directly with Mr. Rubin, the Secretary of the
                        Treasury? How did you find him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. A very impressive guy. A very decent man, very able, very much
                    without ego. I've maintained contact with him since.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You consider him also to be a pretty able character?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: He's a very able guy. He does not have Bob Rubin's interpersonal
                    skills.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He has a reputation for being a little excitable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: He is, but he's so smart that you can forgive him a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rubin was someone that you could call on the phone and get
                        through to him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. He never moved his family to Washington, so he was living in the
                    Jefferson Hotel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I learned and he confirmed that he was generally there late in the
                    evening. I would just call him at the Jefferson Hotel and we'd talk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was as you say, he was down to earth so you could talk
                        to him directly in an unvarnished way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You really felt that if this contagion had gone on beyond
                        Korea and so forth that the international economic system was really looking
                        at big problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think it was. I mean the most vulnerable at that point were probably
                    the Japanese banks who had large exposures in Korea. They had not been able to
                    count on being repaid and there were times when it had tried to hold back all
                    the money, their system would have been under great stress. It's impossible to
                    look back and say, well, if we hadn't done this, that horrible thing would have
                    happened. Clearly the threat of a substantial setback for the international
                    financial system was very real.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel more confident now about the Korean economic
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, they've done a lot and one of my tasks there was constantly,
                    largely in public, but also privately to prod them gently to continue doing the
                    sorts of restructuring things and reforms that they had to do to get out of that
                    crisis and then to lay a stronger foundation for their economy. This was
                    something that was a little delicate because I didn't want to appear to be
                    preaching to them. On the other hand, the government made it known to me that
                    they found this kind of reinforcement from the U.S. ambassador to be very
                    useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. They could blame it on you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: In some cases that was correct, but it was kind of a fine line that I
                    had to walk to give advice, but not be sort of imperial about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Department of State, were they unhappy, did they
                        know that you were calling Mr. Rubin on the phone at night?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there unhappiness about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think there was, but it never became a real problem. We took it, at
                    some point I think it was in January we started, I think the Department had
                    instituted this sort of daily report from embassies in Asia on what was
                    happening. We reported fully, but that did not substitute for my direct contacts
                    with the Treasury Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say that I had talked to Mr. Rubin on this
                        day?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I was transparent about it. On the other hand, I didn't rub their noses
                    in it either.Q: Also, you didn't ask for them every time you did it, you didn't
                    say, may I call them up or something?</p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You couldn't do that given the time constraints and
                        everything?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: That's exactly right. No, my view of being an ambassador has always
                    been that I work for the president. I don't work just for the State Department.
                    I have a broader constituency in Washington than just one department, no. For
                    the most part I always communicated with the White House through the State
                    Department. I had a couple of conversations directly with Sandy Berger, but I
                    didn't try to go around the State Department to get to the White House. There
                    was no need to because Rubin and Summers were fully informing the White
                    House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: did you get the sense that the president was interested in
                        this issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Bosworth: Very.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you begin then, you have this economic situation. Then
                        you begin to confront the security issues. Now, talk a little bit about
                        that. The North Koreans launch a missile in the summer or fall of 1998 I
                        guess?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, the North Koreans were becoming even at this point somewhat
                    discontented at what they saw as a lack of progress on some parts of the agreed
                    framework because they had always seen that as an agreement designed to lead to
                    full normalization of relations with the United States. They were not happy that
                    it wasn't moving forward for them. Their missile test was clearly a demand for
                    our attention. To that extent it worked because as a result after a lot of
                    thrashing around the White House and State and others asked Bill Perry the
                    former secretary of defense to come back and do a policy review at this point
                    which actually became more than a review. It became an effort to actually
                    develop a policy toward North Korea. I remember George Tenet visited Seoul in
                    about the middle of '98 I believe and I was complaining to him on the security
                    front I couldn't get anyone's attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the CIA director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: He was then director of the CIA. That no one in Washington seemed to be
                    engaged on this security issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where's the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Damned if I know. They weren't concerned about this and finally when
                    Perry was brought in it was after the North Korean missile. Mrs. Albright had
                    had a very disagreeable session up on the Hill in one of the committees.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the substance of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The substance of that was that somehow she was charged with not being
                    informed about what was happening in Korea. She reacted as you might expect to
                    that and supported Perry's effort to come back. She then assigned one of her
                    special assistants, actually the counselor of the State Department to do the
                    principal action.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who would be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Wendy Sherman to be the principal action officer on Korea and she
                    worked closely with Bill Perry. We basically all worked together. The embassy
                    was very much a part of all this. I went back to Washington a couple of times
                    for meetings in the White House on the subject of policy toward North Korea.
                    Anyway, we finally put together something that was a strategy and on that basis
                    we moved forward. Eventually the North Koreans were persuaded that we were
                    serious and in the last few months of the administration in 2000 we made
                    significant process. I mean there are still major issues left, but the Secretary
                    went to North Korea as you recall. There was some consideration given to the
                    president's going to North Korea. I think many of us were confident that once we
                    had gained enough momentum in moving toward a more normal relationship with the
                    North Koreans that that would be preserved and that we would continue down that
                    path. Then of course when the Bush administration came into office that proved
                    to have been a false hope because they very visibly froze the situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll come back to that. Let me ask you this. Did you look
                        at U.S. interests with Korea, you've obviously got to think now significant
                        economic interests and in this you have the security interests. Do the South
                        Koreans themselves take, I mean do they have significant defensive
                        capabilities of their own or are they just really relying on us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Oh, no, they had very substantial military capabilities. They have a
                    600,000 person military establishment. That has much more technological
                    capability than does the North. Now, it's not the equal of the U.S., but in
                    terms of numbers and capability, I would argue that probably they could handle
                    the North Koreans by themselves. The difficult is that if there were a conflict
                    it would take them much longer to deal with the North Koreans if they did not
                    have active and substantial U.S. anticipation. So, the cost to them would be

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is the 37,000 I think that's the right number, around
                        37,000 troop presence, is that I mean is that a significant military
                        presence or is it a symbolic guarantee or is it both?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It's both. I mean it is more than a trip wire. It is the sort of
                    platform on which in theory a substantial increment or expansion of U.S. forces
                    would be based and a detailed operation plan to get people in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To get people there in a hurry.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: In a very big hurry, but it still takes time. In particularly a time
                    like now, with what we're doing in Iraq, we don't have that much available to
                    deal with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You see a lot of pictures of demonstrations in the paper
                        on the part of the Koreans that seem to express an anti-American attitude.
                        How do you characterize from your experience there that relationship? I mean
                        is that a meaningful picture of the feeling or is that just a number of
                        people that are on hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It should not be ignored. I think it's important to place it in
                    context. Sure, there are some people largely on the left fringe of South Korean
                    society who vehemently want the U.S. out of there. There are others, however,
                    who find the U.S. presence difficult to accept, not for primarily ideological
                    reasons, either out of pure internationalism or because it's not that easy to
                    live side by side with the U.S. military particularly in a country which is now
                    highly urbanized and where there is no space. There's no space for the U.S.
                    military to stand. I mean they're cheek by jowl with Korean civilian populations
                    all over the place. What was earlier a helicopter base out in a rice paddy
                    someplace is now surrounded by high rise apartments and those people don't like
                    the fact that the U.S. military is doing night landing exercises right next door
                    to them. It's becoming increasingly a source of friction to have the U.S.
                    militaries in these areas. Now, as you may know there is a discussion of pulling
                    them back to the South where in theory at least they would be in more space.
                    Then, the nationalist aspect of this should not be underestimated. The same
                    Koreans who believed its important to have us there also resent the fact that
                    we're there. There's a dualism in Korean thought on this subject that is
                    undeniable. Korea has had foreign military forces on its territory since the
                    late 1800s. They don't want them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Presumably there are some real cultural differences in a
                        sense there are more significant than they might have elsewhere and those
                        are all on a day to day basis I suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I'm not sure they are more significant than perhaps our problems in
                    Okinawa, but sure on a day to day basis it ain't easy. Both sides may try very
                    hard, but there are inescapable points of view.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that the U.S. military as you dealt with them
                        as reasonably sensitive to these problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, for the most part. On the other hand, the U.S. military is fixed
                    on its mission as it should be. Its mission in Korea is to be ready and for our
                    military readiness means training. To train was inevitably going to be a source
                    of friction and disruptive. The U.S. military while some of them may have
                    understood why the Koreans were unhappy. They kept saying to themselves, well,
                    we're here to protect them which is in part true, but we're also there because
                    our definition of national interests seemed to be benefited by our being there
                    was not just an altruistic act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you have the security question, you have the
                        economic issues. Let me ask you something else, as you look at the list of
                        the immediate vicinity, one would think why for example don't the Chinese
                        lean in more on the North Koreans or do they lean on them to try to make
                        them more reasonable players in the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think they do lean on them to some extent. There's some, there's a
                    report that they cut off their petroleum supply for a while just to get their
                    attention. First of all North Korea is very resistant to pressure from China.
                    There's a long history in Korea, Chinese pressure on them to do things they
                    don't want to do and the history of them resisting. Secondly, China's interests
                    in North Korea are similar to ours, but not identical. The last thing China
                    wants to happen is the collapse of North Korea. They're not willing to push them
                    so far that they risk collapse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Because of the prospective flow of refugees across the Yalu River into
                    China, an area of China which is heavily populated by ethnic Koreans and in
                    their century's long concern about internal stability, are really worried that
                    rapid influx of refugees would be destabilizing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does this explain in part why the Chinese keep saying they
                        want us to deal directly with the North Koreans, not in a kind of group
                        framework?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think everybody increasingly would be willing to deal in a group
                    framework if indeed the North Koreans would. The difficulty is that only we have
                    what the North Koreans say they want which is a direct assurance from us that
                    we're not going to attack them. China can't give them that. South Korea can't
                    give them that. We have to give it. North Korea understandably is concerned that
                    if there is a multilateral framework of some sort that it's going to be them
                    against everybody else so they feel rather exposed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got, you felt that the thing was on track as the
                        latter part of your ambassadorship was wearing down at the end of the '90s.
                        Mrs. Albright had gone to North Korea and so forth. There's an election in
                        2000, President Bush is elected and what happens after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The most immediate thing that happens is that I left. I left in
                    February of 2001.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that pre I mean, that had already been planned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. I had accepted the job here at the Fletcher School in May of 2000
                    because I knew that my tour in Korea, I had signed up basically for three years
                    and I knew there was going to be a new president no matter which party won.
                    While I enjoyed it enormously as did my wife I found it very stimulating and
                    challenging, ambassadors, we don't appoint ambassadors for life, so three years
                    is a good run at it. Anyway, I was, the financial implications of my being there
                    were rather painful. Everybody knew I was coming back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happens then? You come back and then what happens to
                        the policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Basically I think we then had a president who was in all ways
                    distrustful of to say the least of Kim Il-Sung of North Korea and he didn't
                    believe that we could deal with him in a diplomatic fashion, that we couldn't
                    negotiate meaningful agreements. That of course caused great strain initially in
                    the U.S. relationship with South Korea because Kim Dae-jung, the president, had
                    invested tremendous political capital in the so-called sunshine policy. He went
                    to Washington in March of 2001. Some of my last advice to the South Koreans
                    before I left was don't go too soon. Don't go this soon because the new
                    administration is not going to be ready to deal with this issue and you may not
                    like the answers that you get. Sure enough, they didn't like them at all. Now
                    whether going later would have changed those answers, I don't know. You may
                    recall that Secretary Powell initially was very positive on the notion of
                    continuing U.S. engagement in North Korea and was visibly, publicly, if not
                    rebuked, at least reversed by the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, where is that coming from? Is it the president
                        himself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think it comes from very basically two sources. One is a group of
                    people who came into the new administration determined to destroy the agreed
                    framework. These were the same people who hadn't liked it since 1994. Some of
                    them came out of congressional staff positions, out of a think tank in
                    Washington, representing basically a conservative republican wing. Secondly, and
                    far more importantly, came from the president himself who I think very much
                    views South Korea as a black and white proposition. This is a man for whom there
                    is a great deal of moral absolutism as he views the rest of the world. It's
                    viewed in his rhetoric about Iraq. He's been publicly quoted as saying that he
                    loathes Kim Il-Sung. Then he puts them in the axis of evil when you talk about
                    preemptive defense and we talk about a new doctrine governing the use of nuclear
                    weapons. All of these things make our allies the South Koreans very anxious and
                    significantly resentful and of course they produce a reaction in the North which
                    is not necessarily one we like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there a sense on your part that the North Koreans are
                        somehow engaged in the support of international terrorism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No. They were, they supported their own terrorism against the South
                    back in the '60s and '70s, but there is no evidence that I'm familiar with or
                    even aware of that they've been dong anything in that area for a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, the old, the use of the word axis in the '30s would
                        certainly imply that some direct relationship between the Japanese, the
                        Germans and the Italians, however weak the Asian European connection was.
                        When you resuscitate that term and you say the axis of evil, is there any
                        sense that the North Koreans somehow have worked or had much contact with
                        the Iranians or the Iraqis as a collective entity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No. Ironically their strongest contact of cooperation was with one of
                    our major allies, Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. You get into this question of whether they had
                        violated this nuclear agreement. I guess Assistant Secretary Kelly was
                        there, would be last fall or maybe the year before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, it was in October of last year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He goes there and apparently they say to him, yes we did.
                        Well, now you've got the goods on him. Was that going on in a sense all the
                        time during the '90s or they supposedly were.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: We had I suspected others did as well, but they had retained what you
                    might call a hole card as a bargaining chip. While they froze their facility at
                    Yongbyon which we could verify they might well be pursuing some nuclear activity
                    someplace else. As it turned out they were. Now, we don't know, unfortunately
                    and I don't know how much insight we have into how far along they are. As you
                    may know, there are various paths to developing nuclear weapons. One is a
                    plutonium path, which is the one they were embarked upon previously and which
                    was frozen. The other is a highly enriched uranium path, which is apparently the
                    technology, which they have been pursuing for the last few years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there an argument that if they've lied to us this way,
                        then why should we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see, where do we go from here with this
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think once our current preoccupation with Iraq is over we're going to
                    have to turn some attention to North Korea. I think that there is reason to have
                    some optimism that we can put together something in the way of a multilateral
                    framework within which to deal with it, but I think in the end we're going to
                    have to sit down and talk directly with the North Koreans. Now, whether they are
                    going to be wiling to bargain away their nuclear capability, I don't know. I
                    would have thought six months ago that the answer was probably yes. Now, I'm not
                    certain. Only because I think that they may have, that the only effective
                    deterrent, the only effective instrument of national security for them is a
                    nuclear capability. They are watching carefully what we are doing in Iraq. I
                    think they are not confident that we would not strike at them if they had only
                    their conventional military capability vis-�-vis South Korea. I personally don't
                    believe we would ever attack them simply because the risk for South Korea would
                    be unacceptably high.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You think then that hopefully there can be some kind of
                        arrangement made because there has to be down the road?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me go back and ask you a couple more things about
                        South Korea. Talk a little bit about our economic relationship with them. Do
                        you feel that at least in your time there apart from the economic
                        stabilization issue, what kind of trade volume do we have with North Korea,
                        I mean with South Korea?</hi>

                <p>BOSWORTH: It's a very important trading partner for I think for us, I think they
                    are the sixth or seventh largest trading partner that we have. The evidence of
                    that trading relationship is increasingly visible in this country. You look
                    around you see KIA automobiles and Hyundai automobiles and Samsung television
                    sets and computers and monitors and they are all over the place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel that it's a, I don't know if this is the right
                        word, but that it is a more balanced relationship in the sense that are they
                        a reasonably open trading partner or are there problems like we often have
                        with Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: We still have some problems with Korea, but far less than we did five
                    years ago. Their barriers to our exports are lower by far than they were. We
                    have a tendency here to measure the value of a trading relationship only in
                    terms of what we export to the other country. We should also be conscious that
                    we get benefit from buying things from other countries. This is certainly true
                    in the case of South Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I think that's fair. I think the issue is whether you
                        have a level playing field for our exports, I guess I mean. I'm not so
                        concerned with the numbers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, the Koreans would argue that we are not very consistent. For
                    example, we have been concerned over the last four or five years about imports
                    of steel and what that does to our steel industry. We imposed quotas on steel
                    imports last year. Those hit Korea even though we were never able to demonstrate
                    that Korea was doing anything illegal under the WTO to stimulate sales of steel.
                    The fact of the matter is that Korea has probably the most efficient steel
                    industry in the world because they've put a lot of money into it. They argue
                    that our adherence to the rules of free and clear trade is not total.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those steel quotas that we put on were in essence a
                        function of American domestic policy, rather than an economic question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Exactly. Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you a couple of more general questions then.
                        You have seen policy, have an unusually broad scope I think for a career
                        diplomat in terms of the regions you've worked in and the nature of the jobs
                        that you had. Say a little bit in general about the formulation of policy. I
                        mean, how much of it do you think, is it case by case, is it mostly a
                        reflection of domestic political pressures? If you were brainstorming for
                        five minutes, what would you say about how foreign policy gets made?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: In the end foreign policy is made by people coming together and talking
                    and making decisions. I think there is undoubtedly an influence from domestic
                    constituencies. This is particularly visible in the area of economics and
                    finance, but it is true in all areas. I think each administration, every
                    administration that comes into office determined to somehow organize in making
                    the foreign policy better, there's always the notion that somehow you can fix
                    problems through the organization chart. In the end I've become convinced that
                    people are far more important than the organization chart. It's how people
                    relate to one another to the degree of which individuals have a vision of where
                    they want to go and are willing to be relentless in their pursuit of those
                    goals. Stamina is in many ways a more important requirement for senior policy
                    makers than is intellectual brilliance. You just have to be prepared to wear
                    them down. Now, I think also the ability to articulate particularly in writing,
                    I'm sorry, orally, what it is you're trying to do. It's very important in our
                    system because you've got to bring a lot of people along. You have to bring the
                    executive branch along and you have to bring the congress along. You influence
                    the congress not just directly, but through various interests groups and
                    constituents and I think this has been a weakness of the State Department over
                    the years that it has not been very effectively engaged with the American public
                    and has not been seen by large elements of the American public as being in U.S.
                    interests. I think that's a false accusation, an incorrect accusation, but it
                    still holds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you were running, I mean if you had control of the
                        State Department's personnel system for example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Thank God I don't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but I mean, as a training measure, leave aside how you
                        fill out the assignment orders and so on. How would you try to train a
                        contemporary diplomat? I mean, for example are they getting enough of these
                        basic economics across to this broad group of Foreign Service Officers or is
                        the economic function still too narrowly defined to a specific group of
                        people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think there is still a tendency to put people in stovepipes. Either
                    an economic officer, or political officer or a consular officer and the
                    opportunities for doing work outside those specializations or cones as I guess
                    they're still called. The opportunities are relatively limited. I think one of
                    the characteristics of my own time in the State Department has been the, I had
                    as you indicated, the benefit of an extraordinary wide range of experiences, not
                    just regionally, but also in terms of function and a lot of negotiating
                    experience, multilateral as well as bilateral. That as I look back on it has
                    been largely a product of serendipity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Accident?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. I mean nobody I was never aware of anyone sitting up on the sixth
                    floor of the State Department and say we're going to put Bosworth here for a
                    couple of years because that means that ten years from now he will have these
                    capabilities. I remember when I was working for George Shultz when I was
                    director of policy planning. He once said to me, I asked him what the
                    differences were between running a company like Bechtel and running the State
                    Department. He said, it's just a question of how I spend my time. He said, at
                    Bechtel I used to spend probably about half my time on long term strategic
                    planning for the company. About a third of my time making sure that we had
                    senior executives available next year and ten years from now capable of
                    implementing these plans. That means giving them the kinds of experiences they
                    would need over time to become senior executives with the company. The rest of
                    my time I spent dealing with customers in day to day activities. Here in the
                    State Department I spend 95% of my time dealing with the crisis at the moment
                    and very little of my time worrying about personnel policy, almost none and too
                    little worrying about long term planning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a point. Now you have a policy planning staff,
                        which you ran and so presumably you were trying to identify long term
                        problems and issues and get people to think about them and write papers
                        about them. Did you feel that that really worked that way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It's really hard to do because the regional bureaus are concerned with
                    the problem of the day that affects their countries and that basically defines
                    their interests. The functional bureaus may have a slightly longer term point of
                    view because they're more concerned in some instances about the follow on
                    implications of things that we might do particularly on the economic front.
                    Outside of the policy planning shop itself, no one was really and of course the
                    Secretary, there's no one that's really concerned about the long term integrated
                    views of integrated approach to U.S. foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, didn't Kissinger once say that you had to have your,
                        maybe it was someone else, that you had to have your policy ready when you
                        came in because you weren't going to have any time in a sense to think about
                        it and analyze it while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think that is particularly true of what I would define as
                    intellectual capital. When you get into one of those very senior jobs you don't
                    have time to acquire new intellectual capital. You're working off of what you
                    have, so you'd better hope that you have had that kind of exposure and
                    opportunity to learn things that you're going to be dealing with. The learning
                    curve, you don't have time for a slow learning curve in that business.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say, I mean you saw I think in a sense several
                        generations of Foreign Service Officers. You started in the '60s and you
                        were there in Korea in a big mission, '97 to 2001. Do you want to say a
                        little bit about any differences you might see in the Foreign Service types
                        now and then and whether they're better trained or worse trained or do you
                        have any general impressions about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The Foreign Service is far different now than it was in the '60s. It's
                    both better and worse. It is first of all much less white male which is good. It
                    is also older on the average the younger officers as you say, we might be older
                    than they were. Very few people come in now as far as I can say in their early
                    20s as I did and some one told me the other day that the average age of the new
                    entering class in the State Department was 35. When I came in you couldn't be
                    older than 31. I understand you've got to accept changes in American society,
                    but I think that what this produces is a Foreign Service that is much less
                    geared to people who want to have a long term career and more geared to people
                    who are looking for a few life experiences along the way. That I think probably
                    erodes the effectiveness of the Foreign Service. We also don't do at all well in
                    training. I know that Secretary Powell has been fixated on this and it's time to
                    improve on this training component, but I contrast it with the Defense
                    Department for example. If you look at the senior ranks of the military, every
                    one of them, almost without exception has spent one or two tours in an institute
                    of higher education at some place, that's in addition to the in-service military
                    training that they get. The army staff college, the army war college. We do that
                    so inadequately. We send a few people away for economic training, not very many.
                    We have the so-called Pearson Fellows Program, but we don't really try to give
                    people who are for the most part fairly identifiable within the first decade of
                    their service. You can tell to some extent who has the intelligence the drive,
                    the dedication to really go to the top. We don't wittingly reach out and try to
                    make them even better. I say, we, I'm no longer there, but.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you feel about the psychology of the current
                        Foreign Service versus when you came in, I mean is there a difference in
                        terms of willingness to accept authority, to do what daddy says, to be more
                        or less amenable to discipline. Also the other question that struck me over
                        my years was the willingness of the people to I don't know if I want to say
                        engage with one another. Somehow I felt that for example, families were much
                        more turned in on one another overseas these days than maybe they were 20 or
                        30 years ago. I don't know if that's better or worse. What do you think
                        about the psychology?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think it's different. I think you can't keep the psychology or the
                    culture of the Foreign Service in isolation from the culture of the country. One
                    of the biggest transformations has been in the role of women. I think this means
                    that fewer women, American women are prepared to sort of ride their husbands'
                    coattails around the world for a protracted career. They just don't do it, they
                    won't do it. Now, one of the results of that is, people who would otherwise
                    probably stay in the Foreign Service and would have earlier had successful
                    careers leave to do something else which doesn't involve relocations. The other
                    implication is and it's a quite interesting one I observed in Korea. More and
                    more Foreign Service males marry non-Americans and in particular those serving
                    in Asia marry Asian women. At one point as we were leaving Korea my wife and the
                    wife of the public affairs officer were the only spouses of the senior 12
                    officers in the embassy who were native American born. All of the others were
                    Asian with one exception, one was a Latino. It was really striking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say that the capacity of the current Foreign
                        Service Officers is as good as, better, worse than, in your first ten or 20
                        years or is that too broad a question?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think it's a very broad question. My sense is and this is all sort of
                    intuitive, my sense is that on the average they don't write as well as they used
                    to. That again I suspect is a reflection of what our educational system is
                    doing. I used to occasionally despair of the quality of prose that I saw.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Now, that was not universal. There were some who were first rate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about as managers would you say? I mean it's often
                        said about the Foreign Service that they can't manage anything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, we don't give them any training on managing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this a function of you can cut me off if you need to,
                        is this a function I mean the military, one of the things that struck me
                        about the military is that if they don't have a war on, then they have a lot
                        of people. They have a huge number of people anyway, huge aggregate,
                        millions, that that enables them to take people and send them to school and
                        all that. In other words, the Foreign Service in a sense is geared to
                        today's daily workload.</hi>

                <p>BOSWORTH: You know, if you're going to send somebody away to school then that
                    means some place has to take a personnel vacancy and the military doesn't have
                    that problem.</p>

                    the answer is of course more money and I think he's been very successful in
                    obtaining more money from the congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you see the Foreign Service as having to be much more
                        of a long term of a specific issue specialization entity in the sense that
                        we have environmental people now and we have economic people, nuclear
                        proliferation people that they've got to have people with a lot more
                        expertise in a sense than the old idea of the political generalists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Oh, I think without question. The challenge of course is to decide how
                    you're going to take this career degree of specialization and still produce
                    senior managers who have overall general skills and knowledge and background and
                    that's not going to be easy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How's the Department doing with that do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: So, so. Not very well. Also, again one operates from the realm of one's
                    own experience. I also felt that in my case I was a much more effective person
                    in the State Department because I spent time out of the State Department. The
                    station chief in Seoul used to tell me that he thought I was probably the State
                    Department's worst nightmare because I had been around there enough to
                    understand how it worked and yet I really was not that concerned about my own
                    future in it. Now, I didn't go out of my way to be abrasive or disruptive, but
                    the question of where I was going to be in my next job was not foremost in my
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: right. Would you say that virtually every Foreign Service
                        Officer has got to have at least some degree of economic literacy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I would think so, yes. Increasingly, I would say they have to have some
                    degree of technical wares and they have to be able to talk about genetically
                    modified organisms for example. They've got to be able to talk about global
                    warming and the environment. Even if they're not working on them directly
                    because these are subjects that any informed citizen has to be aware of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because it would seem that the substance of foreign policy
                        is much less the old notion of political relations among nations although
                        that comes in, but the substance of these issues that are all in a sense new
                        wave issues I guess you've got to say. Well, is there anything else in
                        general that you want to say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I can't think of anything that I haven't already said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We may not be done.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, we're here again with Ambassador Stephen
                        Bosworth. This is the 22nd of May and we're going to do some follow up
                        questions to the parts of the oral interview that we've already conducted.
                        One thing I wanted to ask you about sir is that we missed is the Mexican
                        debt crisis which I think sort of sprung up in the summer of 1982 or so.
                        Could you give a little background to that and then kind of tell us what
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: At the time I was the principal deputy in the Bureau of American
                    Affairs and we had been concentrating very heavily on Central America because of
                    the civil war that was underway there. The situation in Mexico began in the
                    summer or the spring actually to be a source of concern and it became clear to
                    me. I went over to the Treasury Department at one point and met with the Under
                    secretary for International Affairs and it became clear that no one really knew
                    how much money the Mexicans had borrowed. They had in fact borrowed a lot more
                    than anybody had thought they had. So, suddenly one day in the summer of 1982 I
                    think it was the Mexicans announced they were not able to pay it. They had run
                    out of money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who did they borrow it from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They borrowed it largely from private banks all over the world. Many, a
                    good deal from the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was despite the fact that with the big oil price jump
                        in the '70s presumably they should have been taking in a lot more money
                        than. Was their oil industry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Their oil industry was underway, but they had shown an ability to
                    borrow and spend a lot more than anybody ever expected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did they spend it on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They spent it on all sorts of things including condominiums in the
                    United States. I mean there was a great excess in Mexico at that point. The
                    political system was not in great shape. They borrowed money for public works,
                    some of which did get built, some of which didn't get built. They were using the
                    money to support a very strong Peso and the wealthy Mexicans were taking
                    advantage of that strong Peso making investments in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You think a lot of that money kind of drained away?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: A lot of it came back as capital or went away as capital flight,
                    yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because I have an image of a story that in effect a
                        Mexican delegation came to Washington one day in the summer and basically
                        said we're broke.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, that's almost exactly what happened. Our ambassador in Mexico at
                    the time was an old friend of Ronald Reagan's former actor, John Gavin. I think
                    he was taken totally by surprise as well. This then began a period of intensity,
                    which changes with the Mexicans involving our private banks and the U.S.
                    government treasury department, and to some extent the State Department although
                    then as now these issues tend to be dominated not by the State Department, but
                    by the Treasury Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, what happened was that they had to go on a very strict regime and
                    we arranged for some loans to be made to them. It was a long time ago, but as I
                    recall they went on an IMF program. We bought some oil futures and paid for
                    future deliveries of oil paying them now or paying them then. So, they made it
                    through only of course to come a cropper again in 1995, '94 and '95 when the
                    same thing in effect happened. They had borrowed too much, lived too high and
                    used the money unwisely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they the first country that sort of, maybe post-World
                        War II period that introduced this question of now what seems to be known as
                        moral hazard where there's a debate that if you bail them out then it just
                        encourages other people to do it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: There was something of that, yes. This was symptomatic, I mean there
                    were other debt problems throughout Latin America many of which were a hangover
                    from the oil price rise of the early and mid 1970s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were countries who didn't have oil and so they had
                        to pay huge.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They had to pay a lot and of course Mexico didn't have all that much
                    oil and they weren't producing heavily until the late '70s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you personally involved much in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, to the extent that the State Department was involved, I was the
                    person who was involved on behalf of the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean how did Treasury feel about it initially? Did they
                        want to sort of let the Mexicans stew or were they immediately prepared
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, they immediately recognized that it was a threat to the sovereignty
                    of some large American banks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the banks been pushing too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. This was really the beginning of a severe debt crisis throughout
                    all of Latin America as these petrodollars that had been recycled. The oil
                    producing countries were earning tremendous sums during the '70s and early '80s.
                    They then were depositing those monies with international banks including many
                    of the U.S. banks. The banks then turned around and loaned the money to
                    governments and particularly developing country governments who had suddenly
                    experienced this severe deterioration in their balance of payments because of
                    the increase of the price for oil. This was called recycling of petrodollars.
                    The problem was that the new debtor countries didn't in many cases have the
                    ability to service that debt over a long period of time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Treasury immediately in effect took control of this
                        problem. The State Department I take it was in favor of helping the Mexicans
                        out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you say, this also produced other dilemmas in Latin
                        America. We didn't' talk much about what I guess this is sometimes called
                        the southern cone when we were talking earlier. We spent a lot of time on
                        Central America, but is there anything you want to talk about in terms of
                        places like Brazil or Chile or Argentina? We talked about the Falklands war,
                        but other issues that you recall from that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: These years of course were the end of the military dictatorships in
                    much of the southern cone particularly in Brazil and Argentina. We were quietly
                    trying to encourage some return to democracy, but the Reagan administration was
                    very split on this question in that people like Jeane Kirkpatrick thought it was
                    contrary to the U.S. interests for us to be pushing these military rulers in the
                    southern cone countries toward democracy. She, and others agreed with her,
                    thought that this would produce instability. In retrospect it seems rather
                    strange that we would be concerned about communist influence in the southern
                    cone of South America, but there was that concern. It had been there ever since
                    the beginning of the Cold War. At that time both Argentina and Brazil were
                    suspected of pursuing clandestine nuclear weapons programs. I remember going to
                    Brazil at that point and meeting with someone who was supposed to be involved in
                    that program and making the case to them that this was something that the U.S.
                    was staunchly opposed to. This was also an era of very serious human rights
                    violations throughout the southern cone. I remember being in Brazil in Sao Paulo
                    and meeting with someone who was a church leader and who was a very outspoken
                    critic of the government.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of the Brazilian government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The Brazilian military government. In effect we had to meet almost
                    clandestinely. This was beginning to change and of course with the Falklands war
                    and what happened with the military government in Argentina and I think that
                    sort of set in motion a process of democratization throughout the southern cone.
                    It did not culminate of course in Chile until the late 1980s when Pinochet
                    finally fell from power or when there was an elected a new civilian. Pinochet
                    stayed on for some time as the head of the arms forces, but he was effectively
                    defanged and eventually forced out entirely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the United States throughout this period sort of
                        pushing at the Chilean military to transition to democracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Again the phrase “the United States” is all encompassing, and some were
                    particularly in the congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who would you say was? Do you remember anybody in
                        particular?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The democrats in the congress at the time. Chris Dodd from Connecticut.
                    A number of other democratic senators who were involved on the Senate Foreign
                    Relations Committee, but it was a fiercely partisan issue. Jesse Helms of course
                    was very opposed to any effort to push the Chilean military or any other
                    military. There was a dispute over the Beagle Channel between Argentina and
                    Chile which was eventually defused, but that was after I'd left Latin
                    America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did a number of the countries in the southern cone also
                        have, they had debt and financial problems during this period and the
                        inclination usually is to turn first to the United States in these matters
                        or to ask the United States to push the IMF or others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Both. All of the above. They did all of those things. I don't remember
                    exactly the outcome in each case and even though this was happening in the
                    southern cone at that point, in Washington there was not that much focus on what
                    was going on down there because the focus was all on Central America which was a
                    much more volatile situation particularly from a U.S. political point of
                    view.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said I think that William Casey who was the head of
                        the CIA in those days took an intense interest in Central America.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Very much so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I meant to ask you do you think that his interest was from
                        the basis mostly of his own ideological convictions or was he carrying out
                        President Reagan's wishes and others or do you have any sense of where that
                        comes down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: He himself felt very strongly about all these issues and I think
                    largely it was a reflection of his own ideological conviction. He was very close
                    to Reagan. He'd been Reagan's campaign manager in 1980. I think probably better
                    than anyone else in the administration he understood Reagan, understood how he
                    thought and knew how to influence him. He was a fearsome presence within that
                    administration particularly in the first term. After the first term of course
                    then we got into the whole problem of Iran Contra and all of that and eventually
                    came a cropper. In the early years on Central America particularly he was a very
                    powerful figure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you just to jump a little bit and then we'll come
                        back, did you in the course of your career have any private meetings with
                        President Reagan or very small group things where you would have a chance to
                        observe him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Oh, yes. Both when I was working on Latin American affairs and later
                    when I was in the Philippines. I never met, well, once I met privately with
                    Reagan, but it was just a briefing. We were flying on Air Force One down to
                    Jamaica and Barbados where he was going to have brief summit meetings with
                    Michael Manley and Tom Adams who was the prime minister of Barbados both of whom
                    were very urbane, very sophisticated guys. I remember going into the president's
                    cabin on Air Force One and preparing to deliver myself of a few words about what
                    he could expect in both places. He had a glass of water on the desk and I just
                    glanced down at it and he saw me glancing at it and he smiled and said, don't
                    worry, it's not vodka, it's just water. He was a kind of a lighthearted
                    presence, but he reigned rather than ruled in many ways. I noticed on that trip
                    as on other occasions that Baker and Deaver really choreographed him very, very
                    carefully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean there seems to be you know, two interpretations.
                        One is that he really was a clever sort of almost an Eisenhower-like behind
                        the scenes maneuvering and the other is that he was just totally disengaged
                        and not, didn't have much grasp of substance. What from your?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think it's probably closer to the latter rather than to the former. I
                    think Reagan's great strength was that he had three or four things he believed
                    in very deeply and he never changed his mind about those. In that sense he was a
                    model of consistency. He was anti-communist. He was pro-capitalist, all of those
                    things without really understanding all of the nuances of them. He had I think
                    from his days on the road as a speaker for GE and others he had delivered that
                    set piece so many times that it had become his set piece and that was the
                    approach that he brought to government. He delegated responsibility, but he
                    created frequently internal tensions, which I think from his point of view were
                    useful. The Shultz and Weinberger tensions, the one that has been talked of a
                    lot, I think that was one way that he had of sort of keeping both State and
                    Defense somewhat under White House influence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He would have been aware of that kind of thing you
                        think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think so. It's possible. I of course left in '87, left the government
                    in '87. I didn't see him after that and it's quite possible that by that time
                    Alzheimer's had begun to set in. When I saw him it was in his earlier years and
                    he was simplistic in his analysis and in his approach to the world. I remember
                    when I was back from Manila and the State Department and the White House would
                    bring me in to meet with Reagan with the press presence because they wanted to
                    send a message to Marcos that yes, Bosworth did have access to the President and
                    he could not afford to ignore me which he would have liked to have done. He
                    never I never heard him deliver himself with anything very profound. It was
                    always my old friend Ferdinand. I never had any real substantive exchanges with
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had said when you went to Manila that a lot of
                        pressure was coming out of congress against the association he had with
                        Marcos. Where did that come from in particular would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It came primarily from the democrats in the congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think because they believed it ideologically or it
                        was a way to score points in effect against the republicans or both?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: In my more cynical moments I would say both. I don't think it was pure
                    ideological conviction, but human rights had risen to the top of a lot of
                    peoples' agenda at that point thanks in large measure to Jimmy Carter and his
                    administration. Reagan came into office sort of convinced that human rights was
                    not an important issue from his point of view. I think many in the Reagan
                    administration changed their view on that over time and began to see that it was
                    important to the American people therefore they could not ignore it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Congressman Solarz, he took a big interest I think did
                        he not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. Steve was chairman of the Asian Subcommittee with the House
                    Foreign Affairs Committee. He took a very strong interest in the Philippines. I
                    used to see him quite a bit when I was out there both in Washington and on two
                    occasions he came to Manila and his staff aide came through regularly. So, Steve
                    was probably the most engaged of anyone in the congress on the subject of the
                    Philippines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, did he have domestic, I mean, did he have
                        constituents who pushed him on this or he believed this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No. Solarz is a remarkable guy in many ways. He's had his problems in
                    recent years, but he's very bright. He's very engaged and he's very committed to
                    these issues. So, he saw an opportunity for himself in Asia to acquire a degree
                    of influence over policy and he did. No, his constituency were fundamentalist
                    Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn and as long as he said the right things about Israel
                    they didn't care what else he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, do you think his was a case of a person who more
                        genuinely believed in the issues rather than.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. He believed in the issues and he wanted to be a player and he
                    discovered he could be a player in Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember anyone else or other particularly, I mean
                        with the example, was the Catholic Church, did you get a sense much at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Sure. The U.S., well the conference of bishops was very active in the
                    Philippines. First they were very active in the U.S. as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what I meant. Did the church in the U.S. push on
                        this issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The church pushed it a lot, yes. We had had congressional, congress had
                    passed legislation which made human rights one of the, the determinance of the
                    country's eligibility to receive economic assistance from the United States,
                    both military assistance and economic assistance. It was an issue that we had to
                    deal with and we were dealing with on a daily basis in Manila and it affected
                    policy in the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was an issue that was certainly had really raised
                        its head in Latin America in your experience there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, very much so. I believe very deeply that governments should not
                    abuse their citizens, but I've never been particularly confident that external
                    pressure is the, external pressure can be a useful addition to whatever is going
                    on with, what is going to force change, but external pressure by itself is not
                    going to cause a government to change its behavior, at least not fundamentally.
                    I think that there was a tendency in the '80s for the U.S. to take credit for
                    democratization and the improvement of human rights in all of Latin America. I
                    think that the best defense of human rights is a democratic government, a
                    government that is transparent and accountable because by and large people don't
                    like it when governments abuse their citizens, abuse them. So, if you have a
                    democracy I think almost by definition you have the effective human rights
                    regulation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any sense that in using human rights as an
                        issue that sometimes it was viewed that it was easier to push this in Latin
                        America than in other parts of the world and therefore that we could check
                        off our human rights thing in a way by pushing more on Latin American than
                        some other places?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think there was a feeling that perhaps there was more recent activity
                    in Latin America and it was sort of in the U.S. backyard so we felt a particular
                    interest there. I was going to say, I don't think the U.S. should claim great
                    credit for what happened in Latin America. It was the Latin Americans themselves
                    who took the risk necessary to bring about democratization. In some cases with
                    our support, our support was not unuseful, but our support was not in my view
                    determinant. Now, if we had been supporting human rights abuses and if we'd been
                    on the other side of the fence then it might have, we may have had more
                    influence. By and large I think that human rights is tied very tightly to the
                    question of what kind of system of government you have. We're in that same
                    period we were very concerned about human rights in China, in the Soviet Union.
                    It became a kind of instrument in American foreign policy to everyone's
                    surprise. Certainly no one thought that the Reagan administration would use
                    human rights as a kind of spear pointed a spear at defining itself vis-�-vis the
                    Soviet Union which is what happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see I just wanted to ask you a question about the
                        Caribbean. Did you see the problem coming in Grenada at all when you were
                        there? I think the insurgent of Grenada was in 1983 and I guess you were
                        gone.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, we were concerned about Cuban influence in Grenada and we were
                    concerned about some of the things that the Grenadians were doing elsewhere, but
                    I think as one looks back upon the incident in Grenada is a grossly exaggerated
                    set of concerns and probably did not justify what we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't it the question they wanted to build a big airport
                        for tourism and we wouldn't pay for it and the international funding
                        agencies wouldn't pay for it and the Cubans stepped in and said they
                        would.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They would pay and we were concerned that this was an airfield that was
                    going to be used for military purposes which in retrospect seems rather
                    silly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, this was an issue that played more as a
                        kind of domestic thing in the United States than a really objective.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I remember the timing of all this. We invaded the week after somebody
                    blew up the Marine barracks in Lebanon. In retrospect Lebanon was a much more
                    important phenomenon than Grenada because that was in some ways first or second
                    nature event what has become an ongoing conflict with Islamic
                    fundamentalism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In retrospect you think the Grenada thing was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, the more cynical people believe that Grenada was a diversion, it
                    was an effort to get peoples' attention off the death of the Marines and
                    demonstrate a victory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had mentioned when you were in policy planning that
                        that was an item that Marine bombing that you had to pay a lot of attention
                        to in its aftermath. In looking back at it now, who do you think did that? I
                        mean do you have a best guess as to who?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I have no ideas as to the organization that did it, but I think it was
                    Islamic extremists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rather than simply the Syrian military for example wanting
                        to push us out?</hi>

                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No question the Syrian military wanted us out and we know that Syria
                    has provided support over the years particularly Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad.
                    There may well have been a Syrian hand in all this, but I think that the people
                    who drove the truck and blew themselves up and planned it represented some
                    organization of Islamic fundamentalism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think I mean did they see us at all as interfering
                        in a way in the internal affairs in Lebanon by appearing to favor the

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They saw us as yes, and they also saw us as supporting Israel and of
                    course Israel was massively intervening and engaged in Lebanon. This was where
                    Sharon first rose to power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were talking about the bombing of the Marine barracks
                        in Lebanon and the fact that Israel was massively intervening in Lebanon

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think the presence of the Marines, they were there for a whole series
                    of reasons, but it was really a symbol of U.S. commitment to the Middle East and
                    that presence, that symbol drew the attention of the Islamic fundamentalists. It
                    turned out to be an easy target, far easier than it should. This came just after
                    somebody had just blown up our embassy as well in Beirut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In fact, wasn't the embassy actually blown up twice or one
                        was blown up and then another, they moved and that was also blown up. I mean
                        was the presence of those Marines unthought out in a sense of really what

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think so. Yes. It wasn't clear why we needed Marines there. Were we
                    going to attack somebody? Probably not. It was sort of the U.S. flag planted and
                    of course when they were hit it was just a devastating blow.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I don't recall all of the details of that. I think there was a desire
                    to get the Marines out because they had been so badly bloodied, but there was an
                    understanding that we couldn't be seen to be turning and running even though
                    this was a terrible thing. We still had national interests engaged and we had to
                    stay.</p>

                <p>BOSWORTH: I think one or two of the people who were working with me there did,

                <p>BOSWORTH: I had left the Philippines and I was in Hanover, New Hampshire at
                    Dartmouth as a visiting fellow for six months and I was approached by a person
                    who asked if I had any interest in this. Initially I didn't think it was a good
                    fit, but I thought about it and talked to people about it and in the end
                    accepted an offer from them.</p>

                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, but at that time much more so than now actually the U.S.-Japan
                    relationship was seen as a sort of pivotal relationship. It seemed to me
                    something that I could get my teeth into and enjoy. I did enjoy it. It was not I
                    suppose, it was not a time of my life when I was as intensely engaged as I had
                    been at other points, but that compensated for that in other ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little bit about Japan and its circumstances now.
                        Is it really just sort of going down hill? As an Asian population apparently
                        with terrible financial problems, what's your sense?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, Japan is a curious place because all of what you've just said is
                    correct. On the other hand, Japan is a very wealthy country and as long as it
                    remains a wealthy country, there is apparently little incentive on the part of
                    the Japanese to change those things that cause them to be stagnating
                    economically. Unless they do change that they will begin a serious
                    restructuring, then I would think the future looks about the same as the recent
                    past. So they have begun in my judgment to lose strategic relevance in East Asia
                    as China has risen. Japan has tended to sag at least relatively. Although you've
                    got to keep it in perspective. Japan still accounts for about 60% of the GDP of
                    all of East Asia. It's still the second largest economy in the world, but they
                    have grown not at all since 1992.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that the frequent trade disputes that we've
                        had with the Japanese are now more or less off the table? I mean you don't
                        seem to read as much about them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think they are more or less off the table. I think we were far too
                    preoccupied with those as it was and I think we spent then some time in the late
                    '90s berating the Japanese for their failure to reform and restructure so it
                    could grow more rapidly. It seems to me we've kind of given up on that now.
                    We're not indifferent to Japan. It remains a very important country, an ally,
                    but we clearly do not view it with the same intensity that we did in the period
                    after World War II up until probably the end of the Cold War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've looked a lot at Asian issues. Do you see China
                        ultimately as being some kind of threat to the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I don't see China as being a threat to the United States. I think China
                    is generations away from being able to project power, military power in a way
                    that would conceivably be threatening to the United States. I think China is
                    consolidating its political positions for the preeminence within East Asia. That
                    is not in my mind threatening to the United States, but it is clearly a fact
                    that the U.S. has to take account of. China is very big and basically almost all
                    Asian countries either share a border with China or have large numbers of
                    Chinese in their own populations and are increasingly dependent upon China
                    economically for trade reasons. This is a tremendous change within the last ten
                    to 20 years and ever since the U.S. has been a nation really we've been used to
                    dealing with a China that was in decline. Now we have a China that is on the
                    rise, so for us this is a startling new phenomenon. For the Chinese it corrects
                    what was a brief historical anomaly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I mean do you see, is there a serious aggressive
                        thrust in the political approach to things, leave aside Taiwan which I guess
                        is going to have to be managed forever in a sense. Are they, do they have an
                        aggressive strain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I don't see them developing an aggressive strain for sometime to come.
                    Their concentration is and has to be on their own domestic modernization and
                    they don't want anything on any developments outside of China to distract them
                    from this focus on modernization. I mean, but nonetheless, as their economic
                    weight grows, their political weight will grow accordingly. I think that in some
                    ways over the last two years as a result to some extent of September 11, the
                    U.S. attitude toward China has shifted radically. We're no longer viewing China
                    as a strategic competitor, in some ways, I would argue we are viewing China as
                    an evolving strategic partner. We share some common interest on the issue of
                    terrorism and we are pushing them to take on a heavy share of responsibility for
                    dealing with North Korea. It was inconceivable two years ago that we would have
                    done this, we would have not wanted to give China that central position in some
                    of the key issues in Northeast Asia. We're doing it now because we are
                    preoccupied with other pressures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have the sense that that relationship is working
                        well and cooperatively?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It still has major problems. You mentioned one, which is Taiwan
                    although I think that Taiwan is going to be settled primarily through de facto
                    integration with the mainland economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of convergence.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right. That's one problem. Human rights is another problem and then of
                    course I for one don't, I think that the ability of the Chinese government, the
                    Chinese communist party will continue to control China the way it has been is at
                    least questionable. So, there is always the possibility that something in China
                    will go badly array in which case consequences could be horrific for
                    everyone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you don't see that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the trade, I mean don't we have a major trade
                        imbalance with them and is that the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. We have now a trade deficit of substantial magnitude. Well, it's a
                    problem in one sense in that it is part of our foreign account deficit problem,
                    but it's also been beneficial to us in another sense, maybe too beneficial as it
                    turns out, but the Chinese export to this country have been instrumental in
                    keeping prices as low as they have been. If you look at the price of clothing in
                    the United States, retail prices of clothing, there has been almost no increase,
                    in fact significant decreases over the last 15 years. That's largely because of
                    what has been going on in Asia and increasingly it's because of what's been
                    going on in China. You can't really find an article of clothing in the United
                    States in any of the stores that's not made someplace in Asia and lots of other
                    stuff is now made out there. So, the Chinese have these hundreds of millions of
                    low cost workers. They have an inexhaustible supply of them. To the extent that
                    people in the West are worried about deflation and falling prices, China's entry
                    into the world economy is a factor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You think that that's a reasonable trade off against the
                        domestic repercussions of certain kinds of unemployment and shifting around
                        within the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: It may not be. If you're unemployed there is no tradeoff, but the
                    problem is I don't see what you can do about it anyway because you can't, the
                    globalization to the extent that there is a phenomena that you can describe as
                    globalization, I think there is, but it's not quite as new as we like to think
                    it is, but it is impossible to separate the bad aspects of globalization from
                    the good aspects and only take the good. It all comes in a package. That means I
                    think that countries have to deal with some of the negative fallout of
                    globalization domestically as we should. We need a better safety net to take
                    care of people who fall through the cracks in globalizing their economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that the Chinese and maybe the Japanese, too,
                        are more or less reasonable about their own trade barriers against American
                        goods or what scale would you put that on these days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, I don't give it too much importance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You don't think it's a big problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No. I mean you can find egregious examples of production in those
                    countries as you can in this country. In the farm bill that was passed a year
                    ago is horrific. It takes money out of the pockets of farmers in the Third
                    World. Our steel quota protection a year ago is awful because we're subsidizing
                    in fact our inefficient steel producers by raising the price of steel to our
                    consumers. Everybody attacks this question of how much and under what
                    circumstances and whether you adhere to an intentional set of norms that enables
                    other people to take reciprocal action if you project. China is now in the WTO
                    and I think that's the best assurance we have of reasonable access to Chinese
                    markets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me just ask you one other thing about debt problems
                        and mall hazard issues. We talked a little bit about Mexico and we saw this
                        crisis in Asia that you were intensely involved in with South Korea for
                        example. Is this simply the way that we're going to have to go in the future
                        that we're not going to come to a point with one of these countries and say,
                        look, we're sorry you're going to have total social revolution, you're going
                        to have to pay your own price or are we, is that a now permanent staple of
                        international fears that we're going to have to keep bailing people out
                        of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I don't know. I really don't. I suspect there will be less of it in the
                    future than it has been in the past. Argentina may be a good example of what the
                    future holds.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Basically they were cut off. They cut themselves off in effect by
                    refusing to do what the IMF wanted them to do. For many countries around the
                    world, the IMF is the United States. We do have tremendous influence within that
                    organization, although we do not control it in every fashion and in every
                    instance, but we have tremendous influence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because there seems to be a very strong rise in kind of
                        political feeling that the IMF conditions are too onerous. You see these
                        huge demonstrations.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, within the economic profession there's a great deal of dispute
                    over that. There are many people who criticize what the IMF did in East Asia in
                    the crisis of '97 and '98 believing that they imposed too high a price. On the
                    other hand it worked in some places. It certainly worked in Korea where the IMF
                    could be a shield behind which Korea could undertake the reforms that it should
                    have been undertaking anyway, but this gave a more political rationale for doing
                    it. Again, I think like so much else in the world and in the U.S., for all in
                    the world, since September 11, there has been a diminished appetite for a
                    capacity to deal with some of these issues. Now to some extent that's a
                    predisposition of many in the Bush administration. We do not want to and we
                    don't believe that we should take responsibility even indirectly for what these
                    countries do or do not do with their economies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said in fact at one point that when you were working
                        with the Treasury to overcome the Korean financial crisis that a lot of
                        steps were taken that were not always, might not immediately be available to
                        archivists as you put it. Could you talk about a few of those things? I know
                        you worked with a stabilization fund or at least made known that it was
                        available. What other sorts of things did you do specifically that you can
                        recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, we summoned through the New York Federal Reserve, we summoned
                    private banks for meetings with financial leaders and financial officials and
                    basically instructed the central the private banks in their own interests to
                    reschedule private bank debt to the sum of $50 billion. That was a short term
                    activity, which was really key because there was no way that the Koreans were
                    going to be able to repay that debt in the time frame that was fixed. We
                    rescheduled the debt and pushed way out for 85 years. That just took an enormous
                    load off Korea's back and gave them some breathing room during which time, they
                    used that time very effectively to enact very serious economic reforms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is basically a form of jawboning in effect because
                        the U.S. government isn't saying we guarantee this, we're saying this is
                        what we really think you ought to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes. The problem is that there is a kind of phenomena at work in these
                    situations where each individual has a great incentive to get out individually,
                    but if everybody tries to get out then everybody is going to suffer. You have to
                    sort of give the banks in this case a rationale for acting collectively by
                    imposing some overall self-imposed discipline and that's what happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Treasury in effect stimulate the Federal Reserve
                        to do this? Was it Mr. Greenspan I suppose?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Greenspan was very deeply involved in all of this. I remember at
                    Christmas time of '97 the Koreans were teetering on the brink of default on
                    waiting through the outcome of a dinner meeting between Summers, Rubin and
                    Greenspan about what to do. In the end they decided to step up and do more for
                    Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. So, we got the banks together to do this and
                        that took a lot of air out of the balloon because they suddenly didn't have
                        to come up with all this money the next week.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right. Then we put together a major package, IMF, World Bank, and
                    that's where the treasury stabilization fund came in. Some of that money was
                    immediately available, was front-loaded, and then other money was available,
                    particularly the U.S. stabilization fund was available as a kind of safeguard or
                    last step. We did negotiate an agreement under which the Koreans would have been
                    able to draw that, but it was our fond hope that they would never have to draw
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this often the case like in the old days, you'd see the
                        movie where the man fearing a run on the bank would run to the front and
                        show that he had all this cash and you say, we have it if you need it and
                        then the people see well if you have it, then we don't have to pull it
                        out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right. Exactly. It's the same concept and what was happening in Korea
                    was a giant bankrupt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, so the U.S. and its various agencies and so forth and
                        its international connections steps up and says, no we can provide liquidity
                        here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else of particular steps that you recall and
                        things you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: The Koreans did it themselves. There was a period of about four months
                    when interest rates shot way up and that has become very controversial within
                    economic circles as to whether that's a necessary step or not. Basically the
                    concept is you have to shrink your economy to fit the amount of external
                    resources available. In other words, you've suffered a massive loss of foreign
                    exchange. Your currency has plummeted and you can't continue to operate as you
                    would in the past. You've got to provide an incentive for people to hold money
                    or bring money back. High interest rates do that. So, there was an urgent need
                    to stabilize the currency. In October of '97 the Korean won was at 50 to the
                    dollar. By December 24 the won was at 1,900 to the dollar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, did the Koreans themselves undertake I think we've
                        talked about that a little bit, their own restructural reforms?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Oh, yes, a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, they were serious you feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They were very serious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They could as I think we mentioned they could use someone
                        like you or the IMF in cases where they could say you know, we're being
                        pressed over here to do this and you could somewhat be the person with the
                        big stick in the background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, that combination of providing the liquidity and the
                        Koreans themselves of trying to be serious about doing this has now
                        resuscitated their economy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A lot of this you were doing in effect on the fly you said
                        you had to make phone calls and the Treasury people and others would act and
                        so forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this, why doesn't this model seem to work as well in
                        Latin America? Is it because Latin Americans themselves don't seem to be
                        able to do this type of reform or they have much greater inherent
                        problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Well, the problems are not that different. The difficult is always in
                    holding public consensus behind a program of austerity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Did the Koreans do, I mean did they suffer from a
                        big unemployment jump?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Oh, yes, a tremendous unemployment jump, a contraction of their economy
                    by almost 10%.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they were able to get through it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: They got through it and they came out like gangbusters at the other
                    end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it because in a way do you think they have better
                        social controls?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: I think they are a more coherent, cohesive society, for better or
                    worse. Even in Latin American societies there is less income disparity. There
                    was a great sense in Korea of all for one and one for all. If we can do this we
                    can make it happen, so they didn't fall into the trap of class warfare that you
                    find in Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right and they had enough discipline and so forth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes and they had just elected a new president at the time the crisis
                    was exploding around them. That fellow was able to come into office and
                    basically say, well, we're going to clean house. He didn't have to waste any
                    time bending the policies that had helped to create this situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, did people like the Japanese weigh in usefully during
                        this crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Oh, yes. The Japanese were very much engaged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In effect, on their own or as part of an orchestrated
                        effort with the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Largely as part of an orchestrated effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because their banks had big exposure in Korea, so it was
                        definitely to their advantage.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: That was one of the reasons we were concerned. If the Japanese banks
                    were substantially weakened by what was happening in Korea, they themselves
                    would be even weaker and that would be our major goal in the international
                    financial system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. That's an example where the very act of collective
                        U.S. effort you feel is really born through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's one other thing I wanted to go back to and then
                        I'll let you off the hook here permanently. I talk a lot about this business
                        with Enders and his removal and because of this Nicaraguan issue and so
                        forth. Was the memorandum that spurred his removal, did that ever come out
                        in public do you recall, did it make the newspapers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Not that I recall. I'm sure you can get it through the Freedom of
                    Information Act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no, but I wondered if in other words, his removal was
                        not the result of that publicly appearing in the paper?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, it was the result of the fact that the memo was sent and people
                    like Bill Clark and Jeane Kirkpatrick were enraged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Although she was the ambassador to the UN, she had I
                        take it a brief to poach around to a lot of things. She was a kind of
                        ideological lodestone of the administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Yes, she did. Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Clark know much about foreign policy do you
                        think?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, but he knew a lot about protecting his president. He himself was
                    conservative and Jeane Kirkpatrick had gotten his ear. Tom as I think I
                    mentioned when we talked about this, Tom had a tendency to expand his personal
                    capital within the bureaucracy at a fairly rapid rate because of his manner and
                    his focus on results and moving quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Was he an ideologue would you have said?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: No, not at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: He was a consummate pragmatist, but believed that government, if you're
                    in government, you should try to do something, you shouldn't' just sit
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was not, because I always thought that he was brought
                        in as you said only to solve the central American problem and shake up the
                        ARA bureau and all these sorts of things. So, he was brought in because he
                        was seen as a guy who got things done, not necessarily because he was seen
                        as a very conservative or right wing and ultimately in a sense his desire to
                        get things done and to do things pragmatically conflicted and out he
                        went.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You felt that he was seriously committed to the democratic
                        process in Central America. That was the conclusion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: That was the conclusion we came to. The only way out of this was to try
                    to use democracy as a shield.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's generally probably more, I mean you can argue that
                        that's putting the best face of the United States forward to stand for
                        something in the world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's good. That's a good place to end.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BOSWORTH: Okay.</p>
