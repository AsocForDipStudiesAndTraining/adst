                <p>Q: This is an interview with Winston Lord. This is being done on behalf of the
                    Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training. I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy.</p>
                <p>Win, let's start at the beginning. Could you tell me when and wheryou were born,
                    and something about your family?</p>
                <p>LORD: I was born August 14, 1937 in New York City. My father was Oswald Bates
                    Lord of Tarrytown, New York, born in 1903. My mother was Mary Pillsbury Lord
                    from Minneapolis, Minnesota, born in 1904. My brother, Charles Pillsbury Lord,
                    was born in New York City in 1933. I married Bette Bao in Washington, DC on May
                    4, 1963. Our daughter, Elizabeth Pillsbury Lord, was born in 1964 in Washington,
                    DC. Our son, Winston Bao Lord, was born in 1967 in Washington, DC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of business was your father in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: My father was in the textile business, went in the family business, it was
                    called Galey and Lord, and it eventually became part of Burlington Industries.
                    When he left Yale University he took a round-the-world trip and got interested
                    in world affairs, and also was interested in other issues, but felt an
                    obligation to help the family business and went into that. I think he always
                    frankly regretted it somewhat and never really enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your mother? She's a Pillsbury.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>LORD: She was of the Pillsbury Flour family in Minneapolis, but when she married
                    my father and moved to New York she immediately began working in welfare
                    programs, going out to Harlem and doing a lot of social welfare work, and then
                    working for Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia. She then had a very distinguished career,
                    both domestically and internationally. It included a lead role in the New York's
                    World's Fair in 1939. I don't know her exact title but she'll be in Who's Who of
                    course. She was one of the top officers in the Women's Army Corps in World War
                    II, WACS. I remember she was one of the first people to fly into Hitler's bunker
                    at the end of the war.</p>
                <p>Among other things, she worked in Republican politics, she was a liberal
                    Republican, was a supporter of Harold Stassen and Governor Dewey, also Wendell
                    Wilkie. She was at the famous convention when Wilkie was elected in 1940. She
                    was in the rafters helping to lead the cheers. So she spent a lot of time in
                    Republican politics, culminating in the 1952 Eisenhower campaign. She worked
                    very hard to round up delegates for that historic Texas convention where
                    Eisenhower edged out Taft, and was crucial in helping secure the nomination for
                    Eisenhower. Then during the campaign of 1952 against Stevenson she was
                    co-chairman of National Citizens for Eisenhower which was designed to attract
                    independents and Democrats to Eisenhower's cause.</p>
                <p>After the election Eisenhower appointed her as a delegate to the United Nations
                    under Henry Cabot Lodge who was the ambassador to the UN. She served eight years
                    on the U.S. delegation. She was also the successor to Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt as
                    United Nation's representative for the United States to the Human Rights
                    Commission. She had a whole series of other assignments. She was active as head
                    the Junior League of New York, for example. She was president of the
                    International Rescue Committee, a major U.S. nonpartisan organization designed
                    to relieve refugees abroad and to resettle them in the United States. I'm now
                    vice chairman of the International Rescue Committee, and joined it in large
                    measure because of my loyalty to her and my belief in the organization. The IRC
                    was founded by Einstein to help Jews escape from Germany. We can go into that in
                    more detail later when we get into my career. She was head of many organizations
                    which I can't recall offhand, both international and domestic. She did a great
                    deal of traveling throughout her life. She was on many boards, the Atlantic
                    Institute, and many others, and I'm just beginning to scratch the surface. She
                    had a very distinguished career. Who's Who would have more details.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this play on you? You were born in 1937, so by '45
                        we'just entered the war. But your mother was in the WACS. How about
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>LORD: I might add that one of my earliest recollections, not the earliest but in
                    terms of international affairs, was having a birthday party in Minneapolis where
                    I visited my grandmother every summer; I visited my other grandmother in Beach
                    Haven, New Jersey every summer. In the middle of the birthday party people came
                    in and said that we had ended the war with Japan, it was August 14, 1945. And
                    being a young kid then I didn't quite understand the full implications, I was a
                    little annoyed that my birthday party was interrupted. But from my earliest
                    childhood, when we had dinner at home, American politics and international
                    affairs were often the subjects of conversations. That was one reason I got
                    interested in public service. My mother's career certainly had a deep impact on
                    me in terms of leading me towards public service and international affairs. My
                    father was interested in all these issues although not directly involved, and
                    had a very strong ethical sense, in the sense of serving one's country as well.
                    So I think the dinner table conversations, my mother's career, and then a lot of
                    early traveling with my parents and then on my own, all began to steer me toward
                    a life of public service and international affairs.</p>
                <p>Q: We'll come to traveling in a minute, but what about early on, reading often
                    plays quite a role in the development of young people. I was wondering what type
                    of books were you reading?</p>
                <p>LORD: I'm not good at remembering these things specifically. In the course of my
                    education, I went to Buckley school, a private school in New York, and then
                    Hotchkiss Prep School in Connecticut, and then Yale University and the Fletcher
                    School of Law and Diplomacy for a Master's degree. And, of course, in my early
                    schooling I had the usual exposure to literature and history. On my own I would
                    read both fiction and some history and biography. I had broad interests. I
                    wouldn't say I was narrowly focused on international affairs at least in my
                    early years, or my teens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume the family was a reading family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: My mother more than my father. My father would read mostly non-fiction, was
                    not a great reader. My mother read a great deal in terms of keeping up with her
                    career. She also was fluent in French and would read a lot of French novels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have brothers, sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: One brother, four years older. He went on to do international business and
                    then he went into education at the age of 40 and was headmaster at a couple of
                    girls' boarding schools. Another brother, Richard, was born badly deformed and
                    died after a few weeks in 1935 - this was a result of my pregnant mother being
                    thrown into icy waters, surviving the sinking of the ship The Mohawk off the
                    Jersey coast.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you start traveling at a fairly early age?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: We started traveling quite early. As I recall some of the early trips
                    included a couple of vacations in Bermuda with my parents in the late 1940s.
                    About that time, or maybe a little bit later, a Caribbean boat cruise. Then my
                    mother and father went on a round-the-world trip on their 25th anniversary in
                    1954. I was at Hotchkiss at the time during Christmas vacation. I recall the
                    silly attitude before I went with them for part of their trip that, gee I was
                    going to miss all these Christmas parties in New York City. I realized once I
                    went and after I got back what an idiot I had been, and what a terrific exposure
                    to the world this began for me. We went briefly to Europe, including Paris, and
                    then on to the Middle East, including Egypt, Syria and Lebanon and Turkey. Then
                    my brother and I had to come back and my parents continued on their trip. That
                    trip really began to energize my interest in foreign affairs and foreign
                    cultures, and a sense of public service.</p>
                <p>Just to continue on the travel, when I was at Yale University I took two major
                    trips during the summers of 1956 and 1958. In 1956, I went to Europe - London,
                    Paris and driving around France, Spain, running with the bulls at Pamplona, and
                    then into Russia, both Moscow and St. Petersburg, and then down to Uzbekistan
                    and Kazakhstan, Alma Ata, Tashkent, and Samarkand, extremely unusual at that
                    point. We were the second American delegation, I believe, to go to Central Asia.
                    Justice Douglas had been there the year before. And then on into Afghanistan,
                    not only Kabul where we saw the famous Jeshen festival but up into the beautiful
                    Bamian Valley - riding in the middle of the night on the top of the trucks on
                    wheat sacks, or camping out near glacier lakes, really quite a dramatic
                    experience.</p>
                <p>And in 1958 I went throughout Asia beginning in India including Kashmir, down
                    through southeast Asia and out through Japan. Each of these trips took two and a
                    half months, occupied the entire summer. I wrote very detailed letters back home
                    to my parents. I felt an obligation to record every impression that I could,
                    actually I put down too much rather than putting down a general perspective. I
                    would get into too much detail in a sort of naive energetic way. I used to drive
                    my traveling companions nuts because I would have a notebook wherever I went and
                    even as we were driving along I'd be taking down every last sight that I could
                    see and got hopelessly behind in writing these letters but felt an obligation to
                    record it for my parents and I had a certain drive and energy. Then, of course,
                    after I got into the Foreign Service I began to travel a great deal. We'll come
                    back to that later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm going to come back to some of these travels later on,
                        but yowere educated where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I started in Buckley School in New York from the first gradup until eighth
                    grade.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, of course, it was a very elite school; looking back on it in the '40s
                    and '50s we're talking about a pretty waspish outfit. I don't recall any
                    minorities there, and there were probably very few Jewish people. But it was
                    excellent in terms of academic education, about as good as you could get I'm
                    sure at that age. I managed to do well at the school, academically, in terms of
                    being elected to officerships, and in terms of athletics. Sports have always
                    been a major part of my life. I'm not a great athlete, but I'm enthusiastic as a
                    player and spectator. So I was at or near the top of the class, and I went from
                    there to Hotchkiss.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even in the early grades at the Buckley School, a lot of
                        writinrequired?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: A good deal of writing, a good deal of language training. We had French
                    almost from the first grade, I forget when we started it but very early. We had
                    the beginning of Latin as well as I recall, and I continued Latin, Greek and
                    French at Hotchkiss. Also, I had some sense of public service even then because
                    I would run for office, president of the class and some of the others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Hotchkiss from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Hotchkiss from 1951 to 1955 which I recall very vividly included the
                    McCarthy era. It was also the year my mother was at the United Nations, starting
                    in 1952 up to 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe life and education at Hotchkiss?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I've worked hard most of my life but I never worked any harder than I did
                    at Hotchkiss. Without sounding too pompous or self-important, I had a very hard
                    driving and successful time at Hotchkiss. I recall being almost continually
                    exhausted. I was first in my class most of the time. I was president or vice
                    president of my class, and Student Council. I was editor of the school
                    newspaper. I played three varsity sports, football, basketball and tennis. I was
                    first in a Latin contest for the state of Connecticut. My education was in
                    liberal arts. I had very little science much to my regret ever since. I have
                    felt totally impotent and inadequate on anything to do mechanical or scientific,
                    and I think it has limited my knowledge of practical things around the house
                    when my wife has to do everything. Just generally I'm sort of mystified by how
                    science and technology works. I never really caught up to that.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>So my education there was heavily language, history and English literature.
                    Languages included four years of French, four years of Latin as I recall, and
                    three years of Greek, and I had already started Latin and French at Buckley. A
                    very good and solid grounding in English literature and composition. Its always
                    helped me in being, I think, a good writer, not in the elegant fictional sense
                    but in terms of writing good memorandum for the government, writing clearly, or
                    being able to do decent speeches, being, in fact, a speech writer later on for
                    Kissinger and Nixon, etc. We also took history, Bible study, math, and I did
                    take geology and astronomy, but they were the only science courses I took. At
                    graduation I was awarded many of the major prizes. I was voted by my classmates
                    as having done most for the school, most likely to succeed, and several other
                    categories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went to Kent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I saw that in your bio. I've always been grateful to Kent because we had
                    probably the worst football team in the history of Hotchkiss. It must have been
                    for me to be starting halfback and end on it for two straight years. The only
                    game we won in two years that I was on the team was against Kent.</p>
                <p>We had a very outstanding, and demanding head master named George Van Santvoord.
                    He demanded excellence. His sense of humor was not extraordinary to say the
                    least. He was very forbidding. But he could teach almost any course in the
                    school, and he was very strict and demanded excellence. I remember in particular
                    one incident that really impressed me and has stuck with me ever since. I was
                    editor of the newspaper, and as I said it was during the McCarthy era, and we
                    ran an editorial attacking Senator McCarthy. But in the course of that
                    editorial, in addition to legitimate attacks on McCarthy, we included - implying
                    it was fact - what was only rumor, namely that he had avoided the draft when he
                    was younger. I don't believe this was actually true. In any event it was not
                    fully substantiated. Mr. Van Santvoord, who probably hated McCarthy as much as
                    anyone, being a scholar, and actually a Democrat, came down and talked to me as
                    editor of the newspaper, and reamed me out, just lambasted me for irresponsible
                    journalism, even though he himself detested McCarthy. He had a very clear sense
                    of what was right and wrong. And I learned a real lesson then as I was somewhat
                    carried away with my emotions in attacking McCarthy and allowing something in
                    the editorial that shouldn't have been there.</p>
                <p>Q: This was still a type of school that was producing what was to be for the next
                    generation the sort of the ruling elite. Did you find that it was more
                    conservative, reflecting the parents, or not?</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>LORD: I would say it certainly instilled a sense of civic responsibility. It was
                    conservative in a sense of traditional disciplines and both social disciplines
                    and academic disciplines. You only got off campus two or three times a year for
                    weekends, and only then if you had good grades. They were very strict on rules.
                    As I said I was one of the student leaders and we had a lot of controversy with
                    smoking - I was among those who enforced a no smoking rule and there was a lot
                    of tension. We had the first African-American ever to attend Hotchkiss, a man
                    named Gus Winston, who was a great athlete, very smart. I was on cordial terms
                    with him but I didn't get that close to him and now in retrospect I regret it
                    because it must have been a difficult time for him. And I wish I had been more
                    of a close friend. I was certainly not hostile and in the very beginning my
                    parents had inculcated in me a total sense of racial equality and tolerance. So
                    I was friendly on that score, but I never really got to know him. But yes, it
                    was conservative as all boarding schools were in those days. It was male only. I
                    guess quite a few Jewish members but still pretty waspish. Most people went on
                    to Ivy League colleges with a heavy emphasis on Yale in those days. As I say,
                    Gus Winston was the first minority. But although conservative, Hotchkiss also
                    preached the virtues, including civil responsibility and tolerance, and serving
                    your country, and honesty and integrity. So I felt it was a good ethical as well
                    as academic grounding.</p>
                <p>I worked extremely hard and I did it partly out of a sense of obligation to my
                    parents who I loved a great deal, and I felt I wanted to make them proud. In
                    many ways I drove myself to get good grades more than learning intellectually. I
                    mean I obviously mastered the subjects but rather than a pure intellectual
                    curiosity, it was more I've got to get good grades. I used to drive my
                    classmates crazy because I had an ingrained pessimism, including how well I'd
                    done on tests. So I would always say, boy, did I mess up that test. They'd post
                    the grades on the wall and I'd be first in my class and annoy everybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I knew guys like you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I might say that at Hotchkiss in particular, although it started at Buckley
                    I had a sense of trying to do things as well as you could. I don't want to sound
                    pompous here but pursuit of excellence and doing the best I could and working
                    hard, including cramming whenever necessary.</p>
                <p>Q: I think its interesting for somebody looking at this in later years, and I'm a
                    bit biased because I'm a product of the same system. There was a sense of
                    service. I mean a lot of them went on to become good merchant bankers to make a
                    lot of money, but at the same time there was the feeling that public service was
                    a good thing, in fact, a very honorable thing to do.</p>
                <p>LORD: This was certainly an element. Again, I think I probably got a stronger
                    impulse and an earlier one from my parents, and in particular my mother and to a
                    certain degree from traveling. But the school re-enforced them.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somewhat off to one side, when you went to Minneapolis to
                        yougrandparents, was this a different world for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Not really. We were in a place called Wayzata, outside of Minneapolis on
                    Lake Minnetonka. We'd always go there in July and then in August we'd visit my
                    other grandmother, my father's mother in Beach Haven, New Jersey. I was not the
                    most attractive person in those days in my pre-teens, in a sense I was a bad
                    sport whenever I played games or athletics. If I would lose at monopoly, or lose
                    at tennis I would turn over the monopoly set, or throw my tennis racket. So I
                    wasn't probably the most popular person although I think I was a good son to my
                    parents. It inculcated in me a very deep family feeling because I had,
                    particularly on my father's side, a great many cousins. He had eight brothers
                    and sisters, and my mother had two sisters and a brother and they all had kids
                    so I had lots of cousins in both places, particularly in Beach Haven. A real
                    sense of family life which has stuck with me ever since. Above all, there was
                    the wonderful marriage of my father and mother which lasted 48 years until my
                    mother died in 1978. My father died in 1986.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any doubt in your mind about going to Yale?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No. My father, who was a very strong Yale man, all the Lords essentially
                    had gone to Yale, his brothers, my first cousins, my uncles. So there was a
                    heavy tradition. And my parents were living in New York City but they had a
                    weekend house in Stamford, Connecticut and we'd go to every Yale football game,
                    we hardly missed one from the time I began walking, up until when I went to
                    Yale. Almost every home game I went with my father, so early on I was inculcated
                    with the Yale spirit. So in addition to the Lord tradition, there was also the
                    Hotchkiss tradition and many went to Yale. And given my record at Hotchkiss
                    there was no doubt I was going to get into Yale, and that's the only place I
                    applied.</p>
                <p>Q: In '55 in sort of the middle of the Eisenhower period, in fact you were there
                    during the Eisenhower period, can you describe your class at Yale? You were the
                    class of '59 weren't you?</p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. Let me make one other point about the summers because we talked about
                    childhood in my family. Actually this ended in about 1950, my parents bought a
                    house on Fisher's Island, New York so I went up there in the summers. I remember
                    our very first summer we were there, we'd just arrived, in June 1950, and I
                    still recall the North Korean invasion of South Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: June 25th.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>LORD: So during my teenage years we generally went up to Fisher's Island during
                    the summer which I enjoyed a great deal and basically took a break from working
                    very hard at Hotchkiss.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anyone telling you in the family to kind of slow down,
                        takit easy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No. I remember coming home on Thanksgiving, or Christmas or spring
                    vacations, and I remember one in particular when I was at Hotchkiss where all I
                    wanted to do was sleep, and I literally would consciously catch up on my sleep
                    from Hotchkiss and sleep during the day to 11:00 or 12:00 in the morning. And at
                    Hotchkiss whenever I'd get a holiday or some free time, I'd often spend a good
                    part of the time lying in bed listening to music and just trying to unwind. I
                    don't want to make this sound torturous. It was very demanding and I enjoyed it
                    in many ways, but I really did work very hard. So when I got to Yale, although I
                    worked hard at Yale, I felt a conscious desire to have a little fun, a little
                    release. Because not only do you work hard at Hotchkiss, you almost never got
                    off campus. You never saw girls except an occasional dances on weekends. So by
                    the time I got to Yale I was ready to unwind a little bit. As a result I did
                    well at Yale, and I worked hard, but I didn't have the kind of record that was
                    expected of me. Yale had a listing of incoming undergraduates and projecting how
                    they would do, and I was projected to be among the top ten or twenty in the
                    entire class of over 1,000. I ended up being Magna Cum Laude in the top eight
                    percent. I didn't work so hard that I got up to perhaps my potential. You had a
                    question?</p>
                <p>Q: I often had the feeling when I got out, looking back at it fifty years later,
                    I really got my education at Kent. Williams, where I went, was good but the real
                    groundwork was laid well before that.</p>
                <p>LORD: That's an interesting observation. Others have made it to me and it's true
                    in my own case. I can recall my teachers at Hotchkiss more vividly than my
                    teachers at Yale on the whole. I had some particularly extraordinary ones, a man
                    who taught us the basics of grammar and English composition. A man who taught
                    Greek and Latin and greatly enriched my English vocabulary because in addition
                    to teaching those languages he would point out the form of roots of the English
                    language. So I've always had a very good vocabulary. It makes me fairly good at
                    Scrabble against my wife. And Van Santvoord himself was an excellent history
                    teacher, and even the math teachers were good although that wasn't something I
                    pursued with as much enthusiasm as some of these others. There were great French
                    teachers. So you're right. I felt that I had terrific teachers there and a great
                    grounding. But that's not to denigrate Yale. And indeed at Yale you have access
                    to some of the best teachers unlike Harvard and some other places where often
                    they're engaged in research and not available to undergraduates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Yale where did you point yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>LORD: I was already thinking well, would political science interest me, and
                    international affairs interest me? But Yale was particularly strong on English
                    and history, not as strong on political science and international affairs. So
                    what I decided to do, and I had, of course, taken a lot of advance courses at
                    Hotchkiss, so I had a leg up, I decided to become an English major over the last
                    two years. You have certain courses you have to take the first couple of years.
                    To take advantage of the strong English department. I had a sense that that was
                    the best grounding for any career whatever you pursued, as well as the best
                    grounding to become a developed and knowledgeable human being, and to be able to
                    read, and to read a great deal, would be a terrific grounding for any career. To
                    be able to write would be essential for any career. And although I wasn't sure
                    of my career I thought of being in the international field but I felt it was
                    more important to get a broad base, rather than getting a lot of specialized
                    training from the beginning. But having said that, given the fact I'd fulfilled
                    a lot of requirements and Yale was flexible, I could take a great many courses
                    outside of English literature. So I focused on history, which is also a very
                    strong department, and took considerable courses in political science and
                    international affairs, as well as other areas like history of art. This gave me
                    a terrific grounding, both to be interested in literature the rest of my life
                    and to help me write well. It had a disadvantage that I didn't get off to a fast
                    start in what became an increasingly important area of my career, namely
                    economics, and I always felt inadequate in science and technology.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were taking history, it wasn't terribly
                        pronounced, aleast in my experience, the history of the Far East.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's correct.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But Yale did have that Yale in China thing. I was
                        wondering ithere was any spill over there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, China was to become a very important part of my life, including my
                    married life. I had no particular interest in Asia at that time. So consistent
                    with the curriculum of most of the schools and colleges at the time, most of the
                    history we took was either American history or European history.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>I might add a quick note on my languages. I continued French at Yale, I dropped
                    Latin and Greek. But the problem was that teaching at Hotchkiss, for that matter
                    Buckley before, and at Yale the emphasis in those days was on reading and
                    writing, not on speaking. I got to the point where I could read in French almost
                    as well as English, but to this day I can't speak it very well and I have an
                    incredibly bad accent. Of course, Latin and Greek was all reading and writing in
                    any event, not speaking. So as a practical help in my career, it was a real
                    lacking here given the kind of approach they took. I could stumble through
                    French, and get along, and I can still read it quite well but I never developed
                    a good speaking habit, and I'm not particularly talented on spoken languages.
                    I'm probably sort of in between. I did extremely well, I was usually first in my
                    class in all these languages, but it was reading and writing, and not
                    speaking.</p>
                <p>Q: You were probably at the end of the line before they really started to take a
                    hard look at how we were teaching languages. They weren't teaching languages in
                    most of our schools, and the ones that did it were reading and writing because
                    the teachers didn't speak the languages particularly, part of an old sort of
                    lousy tradition.</p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, it was unfortunate in many ways. Now, I can always say, and it's true,
                    that at one point for example senior year, I guess, at Hotchkiss I was reading
                    Moli�re, Virgil and Homer all in the original, which is pretty heady stuff. It
                    also was a rather unbalanced curriculum to say the least in my senior year,
                    because I had fulfilled most of my college requirements. It consisted of Bible
                    study with Van Santvoord in this case, English, French, Latin and Greek, not
                    exactly a well rounded approach but terrific for my vocabulary and for my sense
                    of literature and history.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You really got your education at these schools and from
                        then oyou could fly in any direction you wanted, except science.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That was my clear approach. Namely, get the broadest possible grounding
                    both to become an interested and interesting human being the rest of my life,
                    and as the best preparation for whatever career I pursued knowing that I could
                    always go to graduate school and specialized training in whatever career I took
                    to get more technically competent.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: No, it was general survey so I don't recall all my courses now but in the
                    course of taking an English major, you had to cover everything from Chaucer on
                    through Milton and Spenser, up to more modern literature with a heavy emphasis
                    on English literature and American literature but not confined to them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: History was, as I've said, essentially American history and European
                    history. I don't recall taking Asian history, for example. And there's no
                    question that there was a bias in our colleges and schools then.</p>
                <p>You mentioned Yale in China. Before I forget, we'll get into this but in my
                    senior year I suddenly thought I'd like to participate in Yale in China which
                    was then in Hong Kong. By the time I focused on it I was too late for the
                    application. I might well have gone and if I'd done that I would not have gone
                    to graduate school and maybe would have missed my wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You better explain Yale in China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yale in China was a program which still exists today in which, in those
                    days, was essentially people going to Hong Kong studying Chinese. I guess it
                    must have been Cantonese at the time, and studying things Chinese. Of course in
                    those days we didn't have relations with China so they couldn't go into the
                    mainland, so it was a little misnomer. Since the opening we've had Yale in China
                    with teachers going into China and working in Chinese schools in various parts
                    of China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was initially a missionary impulse, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's correct.</p>
                <p>Q: Then it moved into more academic...</p>
                <p>LORD: A couple more points on my parents. My mother had a very distinguished
                    career but in those days, '30s, '40s, '50s, '60s, this is well before women's
                    lib, she was under constant criticism because of her heavy public involvement
                    and traveling, of being a poor mother, of neglecting her kids. I never felt this
                    way. I'm sure my brother never felt this way. We thought she was a terrific
                    mother, and we were proud of what she was doing. And my father was totally
                    supportive, was not only content but proud to be known as the husband of Mary
                    Lord. I've always joked by the way. I was always known as the son of Mary Lord,
                    and just when I was coming into my own. I had a famous wife who was a best
                    selling author, I became the husband of Bette Bao Lord. So one of these days I
                    might make it on my own.</p>
                <p>Q: I'm afraid it's too late. I mentioned that I was interviewing you today and my
                    daughter and her friend...I went to a party last night with them, and they said,
                    it was all about your wife. Ambassador to China...</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>LORD: You might tell them, if they're fans, her latest book, The Middle Heart, a
                    novel which came out a year ago, is going to be a Hallmark Hall of Fame, a
                    television production.</p>
                <p>So from early on I had an appreciation of the equality of women, including in
                    careers and how they should have a fairer chance. I also had a good feel for the
                    way my father took this without any ego problems and was very supportive. My
                    father wrote a very amusing book called Exit Backward Bowing which chronicles
                    all the travels he took with my mother. It's by him with the advice and dissent
                    of Mary Lord, and it came out sometime in the '70s I guess. One amusing thing in
                    that is that my mother was always very diplomatic, didn't like confrontations,
                    whereas my father was more straightforward. He didn't like Nehru of India whom
                    he thought was hypocritical and more or less he didn't like the fact he always
                    sort of leaned toward the Russians. But my mother knew his daughter, Mrs. Gandhi
                    very well and didn't want to alienate her in the book. So my father said some
                    nasty things about Nehru in one of the chapters. My mother said, “you've got to
                    take that out.” So my father resolved this by saying in the introduction, “I was
                    going to write the following nasty things about Mr. Nehru but Mary said I
                    couldn't do it so therefore I decided to take out the following paragraph”, and
                    he left the paragraph in.</p>
                <p>Q: Tell me, you were at Hotchkiss and Yale within commuting distance of New York,
                    so I would imagine that the United Nations and other places were coming home to
                    you every day.</p>
                <p>LORD: It was, although I'm trying to remember...I'm not sure, enlightened as I
                    was and admiring and proud of my mother as I was, whether I fully recognized the
                    whole scale of her contributions, particularly as a womain those years in the
                    '50s, for example. I only saw her speak at the United Nations once or twice, and
                    I've always felt badly about that. I don't feel somehow, maybe my memory is
                    playing tricks, that I was as fully involved in her career at that point as I
                    might have been. Of course up at Hotchkiss you're pretty well secluded, no
                    question about it. By the time I got to Yale she was still in the United Nations
                    and I was following it but I can't say it was brought home to me every day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have house guests, you'd come home and there

                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>LORD: My parents had lots of receptions, my mother because she was at the UN for
                    eight years as a delegate and she would entertain a lot of UN people at her
                    home. So I was involved in that, and I think maybe my memory is playing tricks,
                    I must have been more aware and exposed to it than I recall. I just recall that
                    I didn't see mother speaking that much and I've always regretted that. There's
                    another illustration of the strength of my parents marriage, and their different
                    approaches. It was during the time, I believe, of the Hungarian revolution being
                    put down by the Russians in 1956. My mother was having a party, it was probably
                    during the General Assembly at the time in the fall, I don't recall the exact
                    dates now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was October of '56 because you had both the Suez crises

                </p>
                <p>LORD: In '56 Eisenhower's reelection I recall, that's right. So she was having
                    one of these big UN parties which included the Russian ambassador and others.
                    While she was having that party in our apartment in New York on Park Avenue, my
                    father was outside the Russian mission to the United Nations carrying a sign and
                    protesting their invasion of Hungary at the exact same time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Yale, what about extra curricular things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, I was in a secret society called Skull and Bones which my father had
                    been in, and he was extremely pleased that I followed his footsteps. I was
                    president of my fraternity called The Fence Club. I was an enthusiastic athlete
                    but not good enough for Yale standards so I played a lot of sports at the
                    individual college at intramural level, basketball and softball. And indeed I
                    was proud, though that's clearly an inflated adjective, to be captain for two
                    years running of the championship touch football team at Yale my junior and
                    senior years which meant we played Harvard the weekend of the Yale-Harvard
                    football game and unfortunately we lost both times. And one time I know we found
                    out, he never let me forget it, that the captain on the other side was Tony Lake
                    of the Harvard team. They beat us in the last play of the game. I remember I was
                    playing defensive halfback and some guy caught a ball just in front of me in the
                    end zone. Just before that I'd caught a pass diving in the end zone. I went from
                    hero to goat. So I did sports, and frankly I did a lot of partying at Yale as
                    part of this release from the discipline and the closure and hard work at
                    Hotchkiss. I worked hard at Yale. I don't want to denigrate what I did, and I
                    obviously did well, as I said magna cum laude, etc., but I also was determined
                    to have a good time.I was also in the Young Republicans Club so I kept up my
                    political interests, but I didn't try out for the newspaper, for example, which
                    I knew would take a lot of time, and I didn't try to kill myself on a lot of
                    extracurricular activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the social life like in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>LORD: Immature. I did more drinking than I should have on weekends, fraternity
                    parties. We had a good time, it was good clean fun. You import dates for the
                    weekend, or we'd go to girls' colleges. Yale, of course, was not coed at the
                    time. Parties revolved in my case often around Fence Club which was a
                    fraternity. Without going into the secrets of Skull and Bones, it was a very
                    good experience in terms of being willing to open yourself up to others, and to
                    talk about personal things and gain some greater appreciation of human nature by
                    hearing about other people's experiences. So that was very useful as well.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any push for international affairs? I mean a national student
                    organization, there are various organizations like a United Nations
                    organization, or anything like that at the university level?</p>
                <p>LORD: I guess I was also involved, in addition to Young Republicans, in a
                    political science club, I forget what it was called then, which would be
                    involved in having speakers come, etc. So I had an interest in that, but again I
                    didn't kill myself in extracurricular activities. I really was determined to
                    reserve enough to have a good time, as well as my studies and sports. I do
                    recall major demonstrations on the campus during the Hungarian revolution in
                    1956. I mean I participated, we all felt strongly about it. And I continued to
                    follow domestic politics and international affairs. It was a great interest of
                    mine, and I was always a strong reader of newspapers and keeping up on
                    international affairs and politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any questioning from whatever passed for the
                        left aYale at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: A pretty conservative era. The lines were pretty clearly drawn in the Cold
                    War so one was suspicious, not only of the Russians but of course of the
                    Chinese. I held a rather traditional bipartisan Cold War view, that we were in a
                    global struggle with the Soviet Union. I was a liberal Republican even then, and
                    not an extremist in foreign policy even then. My whole career I've been rather
                    centralist in terms of domestic politics and foreign policy. So I would not
                    classify myself among the raging hawks at the time. But I'm sure looking back I
                    believed in a strong defense and suspicion of the Soviets, and the need to
                    maintain our alliances. The need to contain Communist China, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because at the time - its become very pronounced after
                        Vietnam -there wasn't a particular questioning of government per se.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>LORD: Eisenhower, of course, projected a pretty solid picture of integrity,
                    riding off his World War II reputation, his general demeanor, the way he
                    conducted himself in office. I don't recall very many scandals. There was a
                    modest one by today's standards with Sherman Adams. So this was still the
                    pre-Vietnam, pre-Watergate era of trusting government. People wanted to go into
                    government. I would go on to the Fletcher School. When I went to Fletcher almost
                    everybody who went out of there - not almost everybody, but a great many went
                    into diplomacy, etc. That all changed in the '70s, '80s, and '90s, they began
                    going into business and academia and other pursuits. So it was an era of
                    essential trust in the government, admiration for the President, although the
                    liberals, of course, disliked him in many ways.</p>
                <p>I think I recall, again I don't want to have memory play tricks here, but I was a
                    great admirer of Eisenhower but disappointed he wasn't more forceful on the
                    racial question because I always was strong on racial equality from the very
                    beginning. Although historians do credit him with enforcing the school
                    integration decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Little Rock, but it was obviously a very reluctant...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: He did it on a constitutional legal grounds, rather than out of strong
                    conviction. I'm a great admirer of Eisenhower, I think he was a great president,
                    but I think that was his weak area, and I think I felt that way at the time. But
                    to answer your basic question, I mean I would have been anyway interested in
                    public service because of my parents and my travels, but also it was an
                    attractive area to go into at that time. Washington was generally respected. You
                    didn't have the scandals. You didn't have the disillusionment of Watergate and
                    Vietnam. So it was a pretty positive era for that kind of career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to Fletcher, you had taken these trips, and

                </p>
                <p>LORD: The first major trip I took in addition to some vacations was with my
                    parents to Europe, and particularly the Middle East. If I had to pick one
                    turning point in terms of my interests and my sense of where I wanted to go in
                    my life, I would say that trip was as good as any. As I told you, I went in with
                    some reluctance thinking of all the parties I was going to miss, and I felt so
                    stupid afterwards having had that thought. I was so excited by what it felt like
                    to be overseas with other people and other cultures, etc. So that really
                    expanded my horizons and got me excited.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>This was greatly reenforced by the two trips at Yale. In 1956 I went first with
                    just one friend who was at Princeton and had been at Hotchkiss. We started out
                    just the two of us, London, Paris, then driving south in France, going to Spain,
                    the running of the bulls, other parts of Spain. Then joining his family and a
                    man who had had dealings with the Russians and therefore gave us entree into
                    Russia. Went into Moscow, St. Petersburg, and down to central Asia.We had
                    debates on that trip on politics because this man who was a friend of my
                    friend's father was a liberal Democrat, was very pro-Adlai Stevenson, and the
                    rest of us were very pro-Eisenhower. I remember a lot of debates on this. And
                    then very exotic and dramatic places to go to, particularly Central Asia and
                    Afghanistan. And again, this reenforced my desire to be involved in
                    international affairs, learn more about cultures, in addition to my sense that I
                    wanted to do public service of some sort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Soviet Union when you went there? I mean
                        was iwhat you had expected?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: It's hard to put myself back in that era. But I think the answer is yes. We
                    felt that we were somewhat constrained. We had a lot of distrust of the Soviet
                    Union, of course. We had some rather simplistic and naive revelations; for
                    example, in the course of this trip having met some Russian people, we made the
                    obvious distinction between the Russian people whom we liked and the Russian
                    government and system which we intensely disliked. One was struck by the
                    relative poverty of the Soviet Union and the sense of surveillance, etc. But
                    also enjoyed the sights of the Kremlin and St. Petersburg, and the dramatic
                    historical and cultural richness of Central Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took two trips.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That was 1956 and we ended up going to Afghanistan. In 1958 traveling with
                    the same friend and his mother, and a girl who was actually a friend of my
                    friend. We went almost three months through Asia beginning in New Delhi. It's
                    the hottest I've ever been in my life. I can still recall that. We wouldn't even
                    do sight-seeing between 10:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. We just stayed indoors and
                    drank limeade, go out early in the morning and late in the afternoon. Went to
                    Kashmir which was beautiful.</p>
                <p>An interesting incident in Kashmir. We were on a houseboat and there was a guest
                    registry. I looked at it, and there was my mother's name and signature in this
                    same houseboat. But what was interesting was that she had never been to Kashmir.
                    So I've never figured out how that happened. I think the rather famous owner of
                    the houseboat had probably taken his book with him on travels somewhere in
                    India. But it was rather weird to see my mother's name and she hadn't even been
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Then we went to Nepal, to Thailand. I can't remember all the places. I think we
                    went to Singapore, and we spent a considerable time in Japan. And that again
                    reenforced my interest in things international, this is between my junior and
                    senior year at Yale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated in 1959. What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Actually in the summer of 1959 I went to Washington on an intern program on
                    Capitol Hill and worked for Senator Kefauver, who had gained notoriety in terms
                    of combating the Mafia. So I spent the summer working for him which reflected my
                    interest in domestic politics; he was a Democrat, of course, and he was a strong
                    runner for the presidency. So that was actually a very interesting time. It was
                    only a couple of months, but I helped him research. I sat in on hearings. I went
                    around with him at times. I do recall riding in the car and he reached in the
                    glove compartment and pulled out a bottle of Bourbon. I learned retrospectively
                    that he did have a drinking problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He also pinched ladies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's right. I didn't notice that either at the time. Again, I enjoyed
                    that summer. I got a sense of Capitol Hill, but by this time I had applied and
                    gotten into the Fletcher School.</p>
                <p>Q: But also did it give you a feel...I mean you were very much part of the East
                    Coast establishment and to be doing research for a Senator from Tennessee. I
                    mean did it give you a feel for one, a different side of the political spectrum;
                    and two, some things that were happening in the Mississippi Valley?</p>
                <p>LORD: The answer is yes. Again, I don't recall with great precision but on both
                    counts, first that he of course was of a more liberal persuasion, although he
                    was not a very liberal Democrat, obviously being from Tennessee. But he was on
                    social welfare programs. And secondly, that Tennessee was more rural and less
                    elitist than New England, and it was interesting to see the different style and
                    culture there. So I was exposed to that in the brief time I was on Capitol
                    Hill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you applied to Fletcher, what did you see Fletcher
                        doing,and where did Fletcher stand in the educational and political
                        spectrum?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>LORD: At the time, in fact to this day, there were three or four outstanding
                    graduate schools in international relations. I didn't really think about the
                    West Coast. There was John Hopkins at that time, SAIS in Washington. There was
                    the Public Policy School at Princeton. There was Fletcher. I frankly don't
                    recall whether I applied to all of them or just to Fletcher. Fletcher was very
                    difficult to get into. It was quite small in those days, there was probably 40
                    or 50 people in our class, and I believe there was something like a thousand
                    applicants. So even with my very solid record I don't know whether I could have
                    assumed I'd get in. Although I was pretty confident. I'd done well at Yale and
                    very well at Hotchkiss.</p>
                <p>It appealed to me primarily because I knew there was an international student
                    body. I think at least a third, if not 40 percent were foreign students as well
                    as American. That appealed to me. I knew they lived in close quarters and that
                    you got a great education outside the classroom as well as in it. I liked the
                    idea of being in the Boston area which I had not been in to have a change of
                    pace. I think instinctively I felt my career would take me to Washington at some
                    point, so why not experience Boston instead of Washington at that point. And it
                    had a very good reputation. So for all those reasons I decided to go there. And
                    frankly also, I recall you could get a Master's degree in one year as opposed to
                    two years which appealed to me. I had not finally decided exactly what I was
                    going to do, but I did feel the need to get more grounding in international
                    affairs and by then had decided pretty much that my career was going to be in
                    that direction. But as I entered Fletcher I hadn't formally decided on the
                    Foreign Service but that was an option. I took the Foreign Service exam to keep
                    my options open I believe in the fall - maybe its later in the year. I arrived
                    in '59 in the fall and graduated in June 1960. And I passed that exam and I
                    passed the oral exam and I decided to go into the Foreign Service. Fletcher was
                    a terrific experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Fletcher when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: The fall of 1959 to June 1960. If I had to pick out the happiest years of
                    my life, this would be towards the top. First, I met my future wife there and I
                    always joke that I first started becoming her friend because she took very good
                    notes in economic classes, which she did by the way. So we began to get very
                    close starting around December, then we graduated. Since we'd seen each other
                    every day, we thought this is a little artificial so she went off to Hawaii to
                    work - that's the furthest she could get away from me and still be in the United
                    States. She was a Chinese citizen, born in Shanghai, didn't want to leave the
                    country because she wasn't sure she could get back in on her passport so she
                    went off to Hawaii. She actually left for Hawaii with $50.00, a one-way ticket,
                    no job, and no contacts but she was determined to show that she could work on
                    her own, survive and also to test our relationship and within a week she became
                    executive assistant to the head of the East-West Center which was just starting
                    up. So that was one reason I had a happy year.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Secondly, intellectually terrific teachers, and I learned a great deal and got
                    more particular grounding in this field that I was going to pursue, Yale having
                    been a broader foundation, and got economics and international law,
                    international organization, regional studies. Had terrific teachers there, in
                    international law, in economics, and diplomacy.</p>
                <p>Then on top of the classroom, there's the education even outside the classroom
                    that was even more extraordinary. We had a terrific variety of students, first
                    on the American side of all ideological persuasions, whether African-Americans,
                    or semi-racist southerners, liberals, conservatives, students from across the
                    country. And then international students from around the world, comprising as I
                    said, 30 to 40 percent of the student body. And we all lived in two small
                    houses, saw each other at meals, and played sports together as well as studied
                    together, and it was a tremendous experience.</p>
                <p>Interesting, given the fact now I'm not a great one for small talk, or
                    particularly a good conversationist, like my wife is. At the time I was eager to
                    talk to people and learn, and engage with people, and soak up as much as I
                    could, even to the point of driving my future wife crazy at the time. But since
                    then those roles have reversed. It was a tremendous year from every standpoint,
                    and I ended up being first in my class. I made a lot of friends, learned a great
                    deal about human nature, about other cultures. I met my future wife! I just had
                    a terrific time.</p>
                <p>Q: Can you give me some of the feeling that you got about different approaches. I
                    mean you say about 40 percent of the student body was from other countries. Were
                    there different approaches?</p>
                <p>LORD: I might add also this is the first time in my education that I was in a
                    class with women. Yale, Hotchkiss and Buckley had all been strictly male, of
                    course - not to mention a lot of minorities both in America and people from
                    other cultures. So being inherently, I believe, liberal in these issues I was
                    delighted to have this interaction and it enriched my education socially as well
                    as academically. It's hard to answer your question. Obviously people from other
                    cultures had somewhat different approaches. Everyone worked hard, you had to, it
                    was very demanding but I believe those from other countries probably worked the
                    hardest because they were selected and I'm sure in intense competition. Some of
                    them were there in mid-career in the Foreign Service, or about to go into
                    Foreign Service. Quite a few women from overseas which was also interesting. I
                    think in every case they felt an obligation to their family, or to their nation,
                    or to their government to do well. So I think that maybe was one distinction,
                    although certainly the Americans on the whole worked hard as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there '59 to '60. Did the beginning of
                        thKennedy-Nixon campaign intrude on your cloistered life?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>LORD: I'm smiling because I was going to mention that. While we were there we
                    were beginning to look toward the 1960 campaign, and being a Republican I was
                    obviously getting interested in this, and my mother, of course, had worked
                    throughout that period, up until then, in the United Nations. I'm not precisely
                    sure whether I was always for Nixon, given my persuasion at the time, I
                    evidently should have been for Rockefeller. I frankly can't recall whether I was
                    rooting for Rockefeller or not - I certainly favored him in 1968. Since Nixon
                    was the Vice President to Eisenhower, and since my mother worked for that
                    administration, I was very high on Nixon. So even though I was a liberal
                    Republican I probably was for Nixon from the beginning. But I very much hoped
                    when he got the nomination that he would pick Rockefeller as his Vice President.
                    I thought that would be the best chance for the ticket, and I was very high on
                    Rockefeller. I recall, even at the time, and I did keep a diary at Fletcher that
                    I haven't even reread even for this process I'll go back and make sure I don't
                    miss anything, but it was more personal. But I do recall, even then beginning to
                    work on this issue of thinking about Nixon, reading everything I could on Nixon.
                    Reading several biographies on him, both favorable and unfavorable, convinced he
                    would make an excellent President, beginning to talk him up to my fellow
                    students, many of whom were much more liberal and were very distrustful of
                    Nixon, of course who had a reputation whether it was Alger Hiss which was at
                    least very defensible in many ways, in Helen Douglas' Senate campaign and others
                    which were less defensible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: California Senatorial politics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's right, when Nixon had been accused of slandering his opponents.
                    Whereas with Alger Hiss he turned out to be correct. So I remember writing in my
                    diary and talking to others about how Nixon was going to be a good President. I
                    even began writing some friends, although I'm not a great letter writer that
                    might have been done more after I graduated and we got closer to the nomination.
                    So yes, that election was already pending and beginning to intrude upon my life,
                    and indeed I became a volunteer in the Nixon campaign after I left Fletcher.</p>
                <p>Q: I was wondering whether in your association with Kefauver, who was a strong
                    contender for the Democratic side, did you have reservations about him or
                    not?</p>
                <p>LORD: I didn't realize his personal faults, maybe I was naive but it wasn't clear
                    to me either his drinking or womanizer problems, and being somewhat old
                    fashioned that would have lessened my estimation of him. But I recall he was
                    always courteous and his staff was, so I liked him. I did not think he was a
                    giant, I don't think I ever thought of him as a possible presidential contender.
                    I had to wrestle with some of my views on domestic issues, in particular against
                    the Kefauver positions. But I don't recall being persuaded, I was still a
                    Republican in the sense of limited government, although very strong on racial
                    equality. I can't remember whether Kefauver was a strong candidate for the
                    election in 1960. Maybe I'm wrong.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the '56 election for Vice President.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I think his time had passed by then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were dealing with the world at Fletcher, were there
                        any particular areas where you began to focus? I mean, having a young lady
                        you were very interested in China. Did that move you towards looking at the
                        Far East?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: It certainly did, although again it's hard to quantify from a distance.
                    Clearly I got more interested in Asia but I think like most of us Europe and the
                    Soviet Union was the major focus, and I of course had been to Russia, and I had
                    been to Asia so I had an interest in Asia as well. So those are the two
                    continents that intrigued me more than Latin America or Africa. Indeed, in my
                    career I became a generalist, and more recently more Asian-focused.</p>
                <p>Q: With your international group at Fletcher, did you find there was sort of a
                    different view of our rather strong anti-view towards the Soviet Union and
                    China?</p>
                <p>LORD: I don't recall specifically. I know we had a lot of debates, both with
                    Americans about domestic politics, and with foreigners about international
                    affairs. But I believe most of the students came from countries that were pretty
                    much on our side during the Cold War. There were several Pakistanis, several
                    Thai students, some Japanese, Latin Americans, only a couple Middle East
                    students as I recall. So I think most of them were from countries that were
                    allies - it doesn't mean they personally would necessarily subscribe to their
                    government's position. I don't recall a great challenge over my anti-Soviet
                    position. There might have been some individuals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just so I get the timing down. You got out in June of
                        1960. Homuch involved were you in the Nixon campaign?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I went immediately to Washington. What I had hoped at the time, and in
                    retrospect it would have been much better was to be in the research end where I
                    could do work on substantive issues. Instead I ended up where I was least
                    qualified, in sort of the advance man/volunteer effort, organizing campaign
                    stops and travel. This was frankly a very traumatic experience for me that
                    summer because for the first time I suffered a real loss of confidence. I had
                    pretty much sailed through life being at the top of my class, being rather
                    popular and doing well, and just assuming that I would always prevail. I
                    remember when I was quite young Joe Alsop, the famous journalist, once asked me
                    at a party what I wanted to be when I grew up? And I said Secretary of State. So
                    I went into that summer having just come out of Fletcher as number one. It was
                    probably the most intensely competitive academic community in the country
                    almost, and I was feeling pretty sure of myself.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>So I was devastated when I got there. I was immediately assigned to Bob Haldeman,
                    the future Chief of Staff to Nixon, sitting in an office near him. He was head
                    of the advance men. These are the people who go out in front of the President
                    and arrange all the campaign stops. He was also in charge of his basic travel
                    and a good part of his strategy. None of which I was qualified for, as someone
                    who had been spared, I say that sadly, the practical experience of running
                    organizations, and not technologically or scientifically, skillful or
                    experienced. Here I was supposed to help out on advance work, and I was just
                    totally unqualified. But beyond that, even though I could have eagerly pitched
                    in and I was ready to do that, Haldeman was icy cold for reasons I never
                    understood. He must have felt that I was forced upon him because my mother was
                    so important in the Eisenhower administration, that they had to take me because
                    I was the son of Mary Lord.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was also of the California contingent and felt like
                        countrcousins in the eastern establishment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Either that or felt the eastern establishment was snobbish. I certainly was
                    not one to project that image frankly in all fairness, and I was eager and ready
                    to help but I did look over some of my jottings at the time that summer and
                    starting out with self confidence, eagerness, wishing I was in a more
                    comfortable place, namely research. But excited about seeing the inside of the
                    campaign, working with someone near the top, and devoted to getting Nixon
                    elected. So I started out thinking even by observation I would have an exciting
                    time and wanted to do things. I remember sitting outside his office with nothing
                    to do all day long. He would never even really say hello to me, gave me nothing
                    to do. I was reading newspapers, clipping. He gave me one project but it was
                    clearly just to keep me busy, to plan where Nixon should travel the next few
                    weeks in terms of strategy, which of course was crazy, what would I know? So I
                    sent him something, but I'm sure it was naive and way off the mark. I gave it to
                    him but of course it was never used, nor should it have been. But I just was
                    increasingly frustrated given nothing to do, and began that summer to lose self
                    confidence, or just being angry that I wasn't employed. And then beginning to
                    feel maybe it was my fault a little bit. I don't even remember the menial tasks
                    I was given. I didn't mind doing menial tasks, but I didn't feel I was doing it
                    then particularly well.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Finally, I was transferred to my relief to a man named Peter Flanigan, who also
                    ended up working in the White House, a much more congenial person, a good
                    person. These were the volunteers who worked with the advance men, but the
                    in-job was not so much to provide all the logistics and security and strategy,
                    but sort of the color, the parades and the balloons, etc. I got out occasionally
                    to some of these events, but I was basically sitting back in Washington. We were
                    supposed to plan how to get so many balloons, and so many people to various
                    places. And again, I was very bad at this and I felt that I was screwing up, and
                    I had a tremendous loss of self confidence. So even though I was excited to go
                    to the convention and to some of the campaign events, and I kept writing letters
                    to my friends about how Nixon should be elected, and I desperately wanted him to
                    win, I was at first frustrated, then angry, and then lacking completely in self
                    confidence. It was the first time in my life that I had ever really been
                    depressed and uncertain. I was telling Bette all about this because we were
                    already very close. So this was a real difficult time for me.</p>
                <p>Q: In a way it's a classic thing. The achiever who has always achieved until they
                    all of a sudden reach something where the elements that make you achieve, aren't
                    there anymore and you're off into a different world.</p>
                <p>LORD: I had an even more ominous interpretation, namely, I had lived my life in a
                    Potemkin village. That's sort of a mixed metaphor, but maybe everything I had
                    achieved really had been sort of artificial in an artificial world. Now, for the
                    first time, I was in the real world, not counting working for Kefauver where I
                    did do well. And I wondered whether I was going to be inadequate, whether all my
                    achievements were theoretical and academic, and within certain circles. And now
                    that I was in the tough real world, and a practical world, was I totally
                    unqualified? So I had a real loss of confidence.</p>
                <p>Q: This happens. It happened to me when I graduated from college at Williams and
                    went into the military as a private. They were working class people who were a
                    hell of a lot better than I was in doing this. How long were you working on the
                    campaign?</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>LORD: I went in in June and I worked through the campaign in November, and then -
                    I'm not precise sure of the chronology - but I had to fulfill my military
                    service. I was waiting for the Foreign Service, but I had to do the military. So
                    I went in the National Guard, U.S. Army National Guard in New York. I applied
                    for that but I had to wait a few months before I went in, and it was going to be
                    six months of basic training, and then one night a week, and two weeks in the
                    summer. As it turned out I got called in the Foreign Service and I was relieved
                    of further duties after my six months basic training. But from November to March
                    1961, I was at home sort of in between waiting for the Army, still suffering
                    somewhat from this lack of confidence, also trying to figure out my relationship
                    with my future wife who was in Hawaii and running up huge phone bills. I spent a
                    few weeks working for the Republican National Committee, essentially phoning
                    people, given lists of phone numbers to try to get them to advertise in the
                    annual year book. I was not particularly good at that, and it was only for a few
                    weeks but to do something while I was waiting for the Army.</p>
                <p>Then I went to Ft. Dix, spent six months there and hated it on the one hand, but
                    knew at the time and knew since that it was a valuable experience precisely for
                    the reasons you mentioned, namely that I was exposed to a whole slice of society
                    that the son of a Pillsbury, New York Park Avenue, Hotchkiss, Yale, New
                    Englander had never seen. And I like to think this broadened my horizons, made
                    me even more aware of other peoples' problems. But I was always nervous whether
                    I could produce back into the practical world again, and whether I was going to
                    screw up in some way. I remember being a squad leader in some exercise and
                    getting my squad lost, etc.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, despite all this, I picked up sharp shooting medals, M-1 I
                    guess at the time and the Browning automatic rifle. And then I was elected
                    trainee of the post, which is the top trainee in my whole regiment. But frankly
                    that's a little misleading because I was not a great soldier and this depended
                    more on interviews and, of course, a Fletcher grad, a Yale grad, in interviews
                    up against somebody who maybe didn't even get through high school, was not a
                    fair contest. So it was a great thing to have and to get a major general to give
                    me the certificate, and to be trainee of the post. But I have no illusions about
                    how high a barrier I was jumping over. I was in the best physical shape of my
                    life, and have never got quite that hard ever since.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you get caught at all in the aftermath of the Kennedy-Nixon campaign on
                    Kennedy projecting youth has arrived on the stage, you know, ask not what your
                    country can do for you?</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>LORD: I think the answer is yes. I mean, I was still eager to serve my
                    government. I was disappointed Nixon had lost. I felt a lot of it was for
                    superficial reasons, that Kennedy was handsome, and Nixon wasn't, the debates
                    where he perspired on television, and Kennedy was self assured. I didn't think
                    Kennedy had the experience or credentials to be President. I somewhat resented
                    the fact that, because of his name and his wealth he was going to be President
                    when he really had been sort of an undistinguished, in my view, senator. And
                    Nixon, with all his experience, and he had been a good Vice President. It just
                    seemed unfair to me, that the people had elected Kennedy for superficial
                    reasons. Having said that I was inspired by Kennedy's words, as I recall. I was
                    already embarked on a Foreign Service career in any event.</p>
                <p>I do recall that while I was at Ft. Dix we had the Berlin crisis. believe the
                    wall went up in August when I was then in the Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kennedy had gone to Vienna and things hadn't gone well,
                        talkinabout bringing up the reserves.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Exactly. Talking about bringing up the reserves is just the point because
                    there was talk that all of us in the National Guard, as well as the reserves,
                    might be extended for a couple of years. Frankly, I wanted to get the hell out
                    of there, and also start my career. So I remember being very nervous that this
                    might happen and I'd be stuck in the Army for a couple of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to the Foreign Service. Could you tell me anything
                        yoremember about the oral exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Not really, only knowing that frankly I had a lot of self confidence going
                    into it. I worked hard to get ready for it, studying newspapers and magazines
                    with particular intensity, as well as going over history, etc., and thinking
                    about the possible questions I might have. So I felt pretty self confident. I
                    probably didn't really realize how small a percentage would make it all the way
                    through. As I recall I felt comfortable throughout, it went well. I was still at
                    that point where I didn't have any self doubt, so it was rather an easy
                    experience for me.II. FOREIGN SERVICE - WASHINGTON AND GENEVA. BETTE BAO LORD

                <p>LORD: That's right. My Foreign Service A-100 course, as they called it then, I
                    believe started in October 1961. There were some people in my class, I forget
                    who was in and who wasn't, that I've kept up with ever since.</p>

                <p>LORD: I don't have any vivid memories to be honest. I remember being eager,
                    basically enjoying it. I don't think I was cynical and turned off by it. I think
                    I basically enjoyed it. I enjoyed meeting my fellow Foreign Service officers. I
                    guess somehow I put behind the whole Nixon campaign experience. I must have
                    still had some lingering self doubts, but I was back in a more comfortable
                    milieu, a semi-academic milieu, the international field, where you participate
                    in class and studied and read and wrote, and didn't have to get balloons or
                    parades working on time, that kind of thing. So I remember it as being a rather
                    pleasant time. Also, wondering where my first assignment was going to be.</p>

                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, very good. She had come back from Hawaii and by then she was living
                    in Washington. She worked for the Fulbright program. She was also a modern
                    dancer at that point, developed that further. She had been a dancer in college,
                    studied under Martha Graham. So we were in love frankly, but we just didn't make
                    the commitment until her birthday, November 3, 1962 when I gave her about 50
                    presents, none of which were a ring, and she was going crazy. She knew I was
                    sentimental, and symbolic and respected me. Because we'd been going on now for
                    some time, both seeing each other every day, and then not seeing each other at
                    all when she was in Hawaii, then seeing each other in Washington fairly
                    regularly. I think she was about ready to give up on me. This is a traditional
                    time when the man asked the woman. Then I arranged for a phone call to come in,
                    just said happy birthday. And then after she had opened all the presents, I
                    think expecting a ring, at the very bottom there was one last thing, it was a
                    big piece of paper that was covered up, she unwrapped it, and what it was was a
                    calendar projecting all the way up to the year 2010, or something I forget how
                    long it went. And it said the future travels and career of Winston and Bette Bao
                    Lord, a handy way of proposing. And then what I did was I listed all my Foreign
                    Service assignments, where we would be so I did two or three years here, and I
                    had us at this embassy, this continent, and back to State in this position, and
                    kept going all the way up. I probably ended up as Secretary of State, I don't
                    know how pompous or ridiculous I was. So that's the way I proposed. So we were
                    dating each other, but we hadn't made the commitment as I went into the Service
                    in October 1961.</p>
                <p>Q: Again I refer to this Kennedy thing, it wasn't just Kennedy but he gave
                    impetus to a spirit of public service. Did you find that your class reflected
                    the same way you felt about it, or not?</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>LORD: I don't know. You've got to remember that in the '50s and early '60s there
                    was a general disposition to give the government the benefit of doubt, to serve
                    your country. So I think Kennedy added to that. But I think that feeling was
                    already there. I think Kennedy reenforced it for me, I don't know about the
                    others - I'm trying to think of the timing. The inaugural speech would have been
                    January '61, we came in in October. But you've got to figure with the time lag
                    that most people had decided to join the Foreign Service before that election,
                    usually you waited a year or two. So I don't think this particular class would
                    necessarily have been influenced by that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there about three months with the class? LORD: I
                        think it was October up to January, two or three months.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about the initiation as far as what you
                        wergoing to be doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I certainly wasn't cynical or turned off. Some people say it's
                    bureaucratic, and it's giving you superficial stuff. There's always complaints
                    about these things. I don't recall having that reaction. I was just ready to get
                    on with it. Maybe I'm glossing it over. Maybe at the time I felt some of the
                    stuff was not very helpful, but on the whole I took a positive attitude and I
                    wanted my first assignment. In those days you at least expressed your
                    preferences. I wanted to be in Washington for a couple of reasons. It was the
                    personal one of working on my relationship with my future wife, but also I felt
                    before going overseas it was useful to have the perspective from Washington. So
                    when you went overseas you could put that in that context, and in particular I
                    hoped and I ended up being successful, to get up on the Seventh Floor, rather
                    than being buried down in the second, third, fourth, fifth floor, figuring that
                    would be the most olympian, more general view of what was going on in the
                    Service, and in the world. It would be a very useful way for a young officer to
                    start. And I was fortunate in being given a rotating assignment - they had
                    rotating assignments for junior officers in those days. And in the course of my
                    next two years I rotated between first Congressional Relations, and then
                    Political/Military Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say the Seventh Floor, could you explain the
                        SeventFloor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes. The Seventh Floor, by that meaning the floor at the highest level,
                    both in terms of authority and seniority, as well as architecture in the State
                    Department. It's where the Secretary and the Under Secretaries reside. So if I
                    could somehow get up there and see the entire Department, and the whole view of
                    the world, I thought this would be the most exciting and the most useful way to
                    start out, then I could put other things in context rather than starting out
                    with a bird's eye view either in an embassy abroad or further down in the
                    Department. So I was fortunate in being given a job with Congressional
                    Relations, which was on the Seventh Floor, and which by definition covered all
                    parts of the world, all issues that would come up in relation to Congress, as
                    well as to exposing me to the relations between the Congressional and Executive
                    branches which is always useful for a typical Foreign Service officer because in
                    those days Foreign Service officers didn't have that much experience either in
                    public affairs or public diplomacy, or in Congressional relations. Many sort of
                    felt their job was in dealing with other countries and the domestic context of
                    foreign policy was something you weren't that much exposed to, either in our
                    training, or our assignments, something we've done a much better job with since.
                    Just like economics wasn't as big a deal in those days as it has become. So I
                    think in very many ways I was fortunate to be up there with global issues and to
                    be working in a job that still had this relationship to the American body
                    politic, and the interchange between the Department and the Foreign Service, the
                    Executive Branch on the one hand, and domestic politics and the Congress on the
                    other.</p>
                <p>I also was working for a very dynamic individual and I've kept up with him ever
                    since in one way or another although not close, named Fred Dutton who was a
                    political appointment, very close to Bobby Kennedy in particular, but also to
                    Jack Kennedy and was Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations. He was
                    always friendly and encouraging to me. That's the good news. The bad news in
                    retrospect a lot of it was pretty much routine work as one would expect. I
                    recall, at least in the early period there, I didn't even have an office except
                    in a hallway. I literally had a desk in a hallway for the first couple of
                    months. Also, Dutton's executive assistant, a young woman who later became his
                    wife, sort of ran things. She wasn't much older than I was, and I've since
                    become friends with her as well as Dutton, but at the time I sort of resented a
                    little bit this young woman, also a political appointment, sort of telling us
                    all what to do. I don't want to exaggerate that. I ended up doing a lot of
                    Congressional correspondence, some of it fairly mechanical as opposed to writing
                    letters. Just keeping track of letters that would come in from Congress, and
                    then making sure they were farmed out to the proper places in the building, and
                    then following up and making sure people met deadlines. But I also participated,
                    went up on the Hill for various hearings just for observation purposes. I
                    remember working on some draft remarks for Dutton, maybe in a semi-social
                    occasion, or dinner, or actually making speeches. I contributed, I think, in
                    useful ways in that. He told me at the time, and has told me since, that I did
                    catch his eye as a very promising young officer. So it was a mixed bag, it was
                    mechanical in many ways, particularly the correspondence part of it...</p>
                <p>I was just saying that Dutton was very energetic and very politicallsavvy.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any impression about the ability of the
                        Department oState to respond to Congress? Was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. I remember at the time the culture still really was pretty retrograde
                    among Foreign Service officers. I think the general feeling was that Congress
                    could be sort of a pain in the neck, and why do I have to sit around answering
                    letters to Congressmen and Senators, and why don't they let us get on with our
                    business. I think that was sort of a general feeling. And in those days,
                    pre-Watergate, pre-Vietnam, the Executive Branch had pretty good dominance over
                    the Congress as I recall. So there would be a lot of following up with desk
                    officers to make sure that letters were answered and the general feeling that
                    sometimes these Congressional people were political, or they were just pleasing
                    their constituents and causing trouble for Foreign Service officers. There's
                    still frustration with the Congress even as we speak, of course, some with good
                    reason. But I think there in now a greater appreciation of the need and self-
                    interest, if not in constitutional matters, to deal constructively with the
                    Congress and be responsible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about when you went up with Dutton as sort of a note
                        taker?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I don't know how much I did of that or with his deputies I would do some of
                    that. I don't have clear recollections of doing that a great deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just wondering, what was your impression of Congress
                        frohearing the questions from the staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, again, I think it was mixed. I think it was a feeling that there were
                    some very able and dedicated men and women of integrity up there - mostly men in
                    those days, but also some buffoons and people who were more politics and no
                    statesmanship. It was bipartisan, Republicans and Democrats in each camp. People
                    who were annoying and intrusive, and unhelpful to our foreign policy, and others
                    who were just the opposite. Of course, it was interesting for me. I was always a
                    centrist, and being a moderate-to-liberal Republican I was in the center of the
                    spectrum, and I was never rabidly partisan. Nevertheless, I had been brought up
                    in Republican circles and generally been for Republicans, and voted and worked
                    for Nixon. So it was interesting to be with a fiercely quite liberal Democratic
                    pro-Kennedy crowd, but there was no problem for me. I voted bipartisan. Of
                    course I was in the Foreign Service and resolved to serve any president.</p>

                        from?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>LORD: Early 1962 until late that year - I don't recall exactly when I went to
                    what they called then G/PM. I got married in May '63 and by then I had been in
                    Political-Military Affairs for several months. I think in the two years about
                    nine months was in Congressional Relations, and about a year and three months in
                    Political-Military Affairs. But I'm not precisely sure of that, it would be in
                    the records somewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Congressional Relations during that critical
                        time othe Cuban missile crisis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Actually, I was in Political-Military Affairs by then. That was October
                    1962. So that's right. I probably went over maybe as early as August-September.
                    It seems that I was in Congressional Relations longer than that, but it might
                    only have been six-seven-eight or nine months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's something about being out in the hallway too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That is strange. I'll give you a couple of examples. I know I was in
                    Political-Military Affairs during the Cuban missile crisis, October '62.</p>
                <p>Q: When you went over to the Political-Military office, what were you doing and
                    can you describe how Political-Military fit into the scheme of things at that
                    point?</p>
                <p>LORD: At that point it was called G/PM, G stood for the Under Secretary for
                    Political Affairs who was Alexis Johnson at the time. The head of
                    Political-Military Affairs was Deputy Assistant Secretary Jeffrey Kitchen. He
                    reported directly on Political-Military Affairs to the Under Secretary for
                    Political Affairs, Johnson. This is before the Bureau of Political-Military
                    Affairs, which evolved somewhat later but it was the forerunner of it. It was an
                    office, as I recall, of very able people headed by Jeff Kitchen. And I still
                    recall remembering when I would deal with Kitchen finding this heady stuff to be
                    dealing with someone as high ranking as a Deputy Assistant Secretary, although
                    I'd dealt with Dutton as well. One of my first assignments I recall of substance
                    was working on a negotiation with the British over securing Diego Garcia as a
                    military base for the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It became very important obviously much later on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's right, much later on including the Persian Gulf and ever since and
                    before. I remember that as being one of my early assignments. I probably did
                    some work on export controls, we were in charge of munition lists and dual use
                    items. I did some work on Asia but I don't recall...I remember being heavily
                    employed and working hard, and feeling quite good about it. But I don't recall a
                    lot of specific projects beyond Diego Garcia and export controls.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved cooperating or working together with
                        thPentagon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. I learned a great deal about that because we had exchange programs, we
                    had some military officers working in our office, we had some State people going
                    over to the Pentagon. So we had these exchange programs. Most of our issues
                    would involve working with them. So it exposed me early on to the Pentagon which
                    came in helpful a few years later when I went over to the Pentagon and worked
                    with ISA policy planning. And I got exposed to things like our alliances and
                    maintaining them, overseas bases, Diego Garcia being an example, military
                    exchanges, and military issues. So this was a useful expansion of my knowledge
                    and experience. I'd just gotten the Congressional dimension, and then I got the
                    military dimension. Since most of my life I'd been studying political and
                    diplomatic dimensions I felt this was a useful addition to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any particular problems or issues dealing with
                        DiegGarcia that you recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Not offhand. We made some breakthroughs with the British while I was there
                    but the final agreement wasn't signed while I was there, as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Cuban missile crisis hit the
                        Political-Militaroffice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, very hard. First of all for those listeners or readers who didn't
                    live through that period, the tension of that period has not been exaggerated in
                    retrospect. It was extremely tense. There's no question in my mind that we
                    certainly felt closer to nuclear war than we ever were before or since, and
                    probably were closer to nuclear war than we ever were before or since. So I
                    still remember the palatable tension at the time, even to the point of having
                    serious discussions with my future wife whether she should get out of
                    Washington, figuring that if it was a nuclear exchange, Washington would be
                    targeted. I remember she refused to do so, wasn't going leave where I was. I was
                    saying, don't you think maybe you ought get up to New England, or even New
                    Jersey with your parents, or something. Of course, she wouldn't think of it. But
                    it was that tense.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Specifically, I don't know about how many nights this went on, but I had a rather
                    heady although scarey experience of spending all night in the Department,
                    sitting right outside the office of George Ball, who was Deputy Secretary, the
                    number two person at that time. And then the next night outside the office of
                    Alexis Johnson, the number three person. They alternated all-night duty when
                    this crisis reached its height. I frankly don't recall whether it was a night
                    apiece, or a couple of nights apiece how long this went on, but it was during
                    the time when we instituted the blockade and the issue was going to be whether
                    the Russian ships challenged that blockade. So I was linked to the Operations
                    Center. It was probably the Operations Center even then. If there was word that
                    the Russians were challenging the blockade, or anything else which suggested the
                    balloon might be going up we were really in a tough situation and their job was
                    to alert me immediately and I would go in and wake up Alexis Johnson and George
                    Ball who slept on their couches. So to this day I remember sitting outside
                    waiting for that, keeping in touch with the Operations Center, and wondering
                    whether we were going to go to war. It was a pretty dramatic experience for a
                    young officer and obviously I was only just a messenger, but it felt like I was
                    a rather important person, that I would be one of the very first people in the
                    world to know whether we were heading into a real crisis.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: I'm ashamed to say I don't know, I just don't recall. The answer is
                    probably no. I don't believe the basic positive breakthrough occurred on my
                    watch. I think it occurred - we'll have to look in the history books - but
                    during the daytime. So it wasn't at night when I was actually doing it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: It's hard to recall frankly. I think everyone was nervous. I think there
                    was cautious optimism that the Russians wouldn't be so reckless as to challenge
                    us. I don't think it was total pessimism, we're heading for a crisis. I think
                    there was a feeling on the whole that this was the right thing to do. That we
                    had to do something on the one hand but an invasion or attack on Cuba was too
                    far. On the other hand, I think this middle course was one that we generally
                    supported, and I think most people felt it would work. But obviously given the
                    stakes and the potential dangers, there was a great deal of tension.</p>
                <p>Q: When you were working on sales of equipment...this was part of COCOM. Did you
                    find yourself in between the Department of Commerce and the Pentagon?</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes, there were the usual debates about whether something should be
                    exported or not, and the State Department versus Commerce versus Defense. I
                    remember I worked with a man named Colonel Robinson who was in that job for many
                    years, decades afterwards, and highly respected. There was also a man named
                    George Newman who was a step above him. These are the two people I worked with
                    the most, they in turn reported to Kitchen. It was a very able group and there
                    were others in that office whom I met whose paths crossed mine later in my
                    career. It was a very good exposure.</p>
                <p>Q: These first impressions are often important. Did you feel that
                    Political-Military was much more a part of and accepted by the State Department
                    than Congressional Relations?</p>
                <p>LORD: I think the quick answer is yes for reasons I just mentioned. There was a
                    feeling that, in the first place Congressional Relations had a lot more
                    political appointees in it. Although these are not resented, people understood
                    the game, you needed a mix of political and career, it was more of a political
                    office in that sense, and it was doing less traditional Foreign Service work.
                    There weren't that many Foreign Service officers even in the office and there
                    was the question of whether Congress was being unhelpful and intrusive, etc.
                    Whereas Political-Military was more traditional. Although even that had the
                    element of working with the Pentagon which was slightly different from a
                    traditional job. I was somewhat happier there. I wasn't unhappy in Congressional
                    Relations, but some of it was pretty routine work. I had this office problem at
                    the beginning. So I can't say I didn't enjoy Congressional Relations but I felt
                    that I was beginning to hit my stride and doing more substantive and challenging
                    and rewarding work in Political-Military Affairs.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: I recall being very impressed by him, but I frankly, now as you ask me, I
                    can't recall his background. I believe he was either a civil servant or Foreign
                    Service reserve officer. He was not a career officer, on the other hand, he
                    wasn't sort of a strict political appointee. I could be wrong on that. I don't
                    know whether he'd been brought in by Alexis Johnson, or not, but he reported
                    directly to Johnson.</p>

                <p>LORD: Oh, great respect for him. A feeling that he was one of the giants of the
                    Foreign Service. Of course, by definition, he had risen about as high as you
                    could go at that point. So I think there was universal respect for him.</p>

                <p>LORD: Vietnam certainly hadn't really entered our conscience that much as a

                    Laos crisis in '62 and the President getting up there with maps, but it's not
                    precise in my mind. So Indochina was just beginning to edge into our

                </p>
                <p>LORD: Of course, it's a cliche, but everybody remembers where they were on
                    certain events and one of those was Kennedy's assassination, November 22, 1963.
                    I recall I was sitting in the cafeteria of the State Department having lunch
                    when I first got the word. I do not recall whether the first word I got was...I
                    think I got the word he was shot and seriously hurt. I don't think the first
                    word was that he was dead. So we immediately went to our, I guess television
                    even in those days. It always stuck in my mind. I also remember it was just
                    before the Yale-Harvard game. I forget what day of the week it was, but whatever
                    that Saturday was going to be, I was going up to that game. It struck me, as it
                    did all of us, a heavy blow at the time and I remember being riveted as we all
                    were to the TV sets at the funeral, and the heroic stoicism of the widow and the
                    two kids and the young boy saluting the casket, and the horse without a rider,
                    all the images that are so clear now.</p>
                <p>Q: You got married at this point.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>LORD: We got married in May 1963, an absolutely extraordinary wedding. First of
                    all, I was very fortunate that we had a perfect in-law situation. I've always
                    said, and only half jokingly, that my parents would have disowned me if I didn't
                    marry Bette, and her parents would have disowned her if she didn't marry me.
                    They each liked the others. It was not a foregone conclusion in those days that
                    you would have an interracial marriage. My marrying a Chinese obviously wasn't
                    as dramatic as if I'd married an African-American, but it was still very
                    unusual. And indeed, the miscegenation laws were in force in Virginia and
                    Maryland, so we had to get married in the District, which we probably would have
                    anyway. Neither my wife nor I were religious in the sense of going to church
                    very much, but we wanted a traditional wedding in a church. So we drove around
                    Washington looking for a pretty church, and we found the Presbyterian church on
                    Chevy Chase Circle, went in to the minister, who luckily was quite flexible and
                    enlightened, and said, look we never go to church, we haven't, but we want a
                    traditional wedding, would you marry us in your beautiful church? He said, on
                    one condition, and that is we had to come in and meet with him several times and
                    get to know him personally, which was terrific, a sense of his church and
                    personally, but also he'd get to know us before marrying us.</p>
                <p>We got married on an absolute perfect day, May 4, 1963. I remember being nervous
                    in the week leading up to it because every day was absolutely perfect and I was
                    worried that by the time it got to our wedding it was going to rain. It so
                    happened it was absolutely perfect that day, and the very next day it poured
                    rain. So we just made it. It was a huge wedding, a thousand people in the
                    church...well, a thousand people at the reception, maybe somewhat less than that
                    in the church. The reception was at Twin Oaks, which was the Chinese Nationalist
                    embassy at the time. Somewhat ironic, and I've always felt half guilty because
                    the Nationalist Chinese ambassador, who was a good friend of my father-in-law,
                    gave the reception and eight years later I snuck in secretly with Henry
                    Kissinger to China and helped to upset Taiwan, to say the least. In a way I
                    half-did my father-in-law out of a job because he was working indirectly for the
                    Taiwan government, an export representative in New Jersey, but also their
                    representative in an UN International Sugar Council. And he eventually lost his
                    job when the UN admitted China and kicked out Taiwan. Of course, I was part of
                    all of that but he never held it against me. In fact, being a realist, he
                    thought we were acting in our own national interest.</p>
                <p>In any event the wedding was spectacular. I remember I was very vain, I've always
                    been very near sighted, my nickname in prep school was Mr. Magoo because I
                    didn't want to wear my glasses so I was going around bumping into things,
                    cutting in on the wrong girls at dances. So I got used to contact lenses because
                    I wanted to see my own wedding, but I didn't want to be up there wearing glasses
                    as a bridegroom. But in those days they were hard contact lenses and very
                    irritating. So I finally got used to them and wore them to my wedding, but they
                    were irritating me so my eyes were watering, and everyone assumed I was
                    emotionally moved, which I was but that wasn't the reason my eyes were watering.
                    So it was a terrific occasion. We were the last ones to leave our own reception,
                    we were having such a good time. We honeymooned in the Virgin Islands.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Q: This is probably a good time, could you give me some background about your
                    wife, because she became an important element later on when you...</p>
                <p>LORD: First on, one further point on the racial marriage. It never seemed to us
                    like it was a big deal, it seemed natural to get married but again in 1963
                    interracial marriages, even though it was Asian not African-American, was
                    considered unusual. I remember my old nurse who had helped raise me when I was
                    very young, a conservative Scottish woman, was deeply upset that I would have an
                    interracial marriage and tried to talk me out of it, and of course had
                    absolutely no effect. But we never felt at the time or since it was ever a
                    problem. It was always smooth. Of course, my parents were totally relaxed about
                    it, as were the Baos, and the wedding was a happy event. It really was a
                    terrific match. We never really felt any problems, and we never felt since then
                    that we've ever suffered. Indeed we've felt it a source of strength, it enriched
                    us both and, of course, exposed me to Chinese culture and language and food, and
                    dealing with her parents and learning more about China through my wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was about your age?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: She is one year younger, she was born November 3, 1938 in Shanghai. Her
                    father was born on November 3rd, her grandfather was born on November 3rd. Her
                    grandmother, her mother, and she were all born in the year of the Tiger, so
                    there was a lot of symbolism. And in fact when she was born her grandfather told
                    her mother that she had all the signs of a rich and happy life. Just the
                    features and the timing, and everything was pointing towards a terrific life.
                    And in fact she certainly would agree with that prognostication.</p>
                <p>The Baos were moving around during the war. Bette was the first child of her
                    parents who were married in 1937, and they left Shanghai. They were in various
                    places, including Guilin, Hong Kong, and Chungking. Mr. Sandys Bao was an
                    engineer and he himself was a remarkable person who was the debating champion of
                    all of China. A great athlete, very intelligent and a great engineer, and he was
                    building or rebuilding factories and power plants in China. And they kept moving
                    around to stay out of the hands of the Japanese, and there were times when they
                    had to go into air-raid shelters, etc. My mother-in-law, Dora Bao, was a
                    gorgeous woman and very strong and intelligent in her own right. So they moved
                    around went into the interior of China. The next daughter named Cathy was born
                    in Guilin, and third third sister, named SanSan, means number three, was born in
                    Chungking.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>When Bette was eight in 1946 her father was assigned to the United States as an
                    export representative for the Nationalist government. He assumed the assignment
                    was for six months or a year so he was only going to take his wife and Bette,
                    who by then eight, could learn the language at that time and that would be
                    useful for her, and leave the four year old sister Cathy and one year old sister
                    SanSan behind. Cathy cried so much that they took her as well. He went ahead of
                    his wife and daughters and then she and Bette and Cathy came over in 1946, in
                    the fall. I don't remember the exact month. But they left SanSan behind, only
                    one year old and she would get nothing out of it and they figured they were
                    going back in six months or a year. So they left her with an aunt and uncle to
                    take care of her until they went back.</p>
                <p>He kept getting extended in his assignment, Mr. Bao did, and then the Communists
                    gradually took over and they couldn't get SanSan out of China. To make a long
                    story short, she spent the first 17 years of her life in China. Until she was
                    about 16 she thought her aunt and uncle were her real parents. Her grandmother
                    who thought she was dying at the time, she actually died a little bit later,
                    decided to tell SanSan that her real parents were in America. When she heard
                    that she wanted to be reunited, or at least to see her real parents. Her mother
                    wrote a letter pretending that she was sick, and was going to be in Hong Kong
                    for convalescence and could her daughter come out for two weeks to visit her and
                    take care of her. Luckily in terms of timing the Communists for some reason,
                    mostly because there was a terrible famine at that point as the result of this
                    Great Leap Forward, were letting some refugees get out. To this day we don't
                    know whether they believed that the daughter was only going to go out for two
                    weeks and go back in, or whether they realized she was leaving. But she took a
                    train to Hong Kong. My father-in-law was very nervous because many Chinese
                    families had tried this, the kids would come out and they were so disoriented
                    they'd turn around and go back in again and not join their real parents. Mrs.
                    Bao was determined to take a chance, the girl came out, and they were reunited
                    and they went to Taiwan temporarily and came to the United States and she has
                    been ever since.</p>
                <p>And that story of her being left behind, growing up in China and how she got out,
                    and her experiences, was my wife's first book to become a best selling author.
                    SanSan arrived just shortly before our wedding and was a bridesmaid at our
                    wedding before she could speak any English. So she was there just in time for
                    the wedding in May '63. I think she got out at the end of '62.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>That book was called Eighth Moon. My wife had no intention of being an author.
                    She was a chemistry major at Tufts University where she went. She had gone to a
                    New Jersey high school before that. At Tufts she was a campus leader, and a good
                    student, head cheer leader for four years, a modern dancer, and just one of the
                    most popular people on campus. She started as a chemistry major but as she said
                    she wasn't very good at it, she did this because she felt that all Chinese kids
                    should grow up to be scientists like Madame Curie. So she thought she was going
                    to be an “ist” as a scientist or biologist or chemist. But she kept blowing up
                    the lab. The head of the chemistry department told her that she could either
                    stay in the chemistry department and flunk, or move on to another curriculum and
                    pass. So she changed to international affairs and felt this was a matter of
                    shame that as a Chinese Asian youngster she wasn't going to be an “ist”. Luckily
                    it turned out later in life she was an “ist”, a novelist.</p>
                <p>Anyway she took international affairs and then went to Fletcher and that's how we
                    met up. So we met and got our master's degree together at Fletcher. We decided
                    for reasons I've mentioned to separate and see how enduring our relationship
                    was, having been in close quarters all this time. She went to Hawaii, as I've
                    said, with $50.00 and a one way ticket, no job and no contacts and within a few
                    days was the top assistant to the acting director of the East-West Center, just
                    as it was getting launched and helped him launch the whole East-West Center
                    operations for about a year. Then she came back and worked for the Fulbright
                    exchange program in Washington, joined a modern dance group, the Ethel Butler
                    Group which was the outstanding modern dance group in the city.</p>
                <p>Early in my career, in addition to writing Eighth Moon, she was basically dancing
                    and teaching dance, being supportive of me but didn't have her own career per
                    se. She did run a major, successful arts conference in the early 1970s while
                    Nixon was President. She had no plans to write anymore, and didn't realize that
                    writing wasn't always that easy. She took on the job of writing her sister's
                    life because her sister didn't speak any English. My wife spoke Chinese. She had
                    forgotten Chinese until she became a teenager and then she relearned it, and
                    felt she was the only one both with a personal connection and the language who
                    could tell her story. So she had her sister dictate her life, and then she
                    turned it into a book. It did extremely well, almost was a best seller, sold
                    probably - which was a lot of books in those times - something like 30 or 40,000
                    hardbacks, was a Reader's Digest condensed book and was translated in 15-20
                    languages.</p>
                <p>Looking back on her first experience in the United States, however, this is
                    relevant to another book she wrote, when she first came to the States, when her
                    family came over it was to Brooklyn, and she arrived the same year that Jackie
                    Robinson broke into the major baseball leagues. The Dodgers were her passion and
                    Jackie Robinson was her hero.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">You might explain who Jackie Robinson was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>LORD: Jackie Robinson was the first black American athlete to play in the major
                    leagues, and he broke into the major leagues in 1947. My wife was living in
                    Brooklyn, he was playing for the Dodgers. So she was for the Dodgers in general,
                    and for Jackie Robinson in particular. She had a very enriching time adjusting
                    culturally, and always felt that you could be enriched by two different
                    cultures, and that becoming an American doesn't mean leaving your native culture
                    behind. She has always felt that she has had the best of both Chinese and
                    American culture and history, and she had some adjustments like any immigrant
                    would. They arrived on a Sunday, her mother had her in school the next day, a
                    Monday. They went in to see the head mistress and she asked what age she was to
                    figure out what grade she should go into. In China you're one year old when
                    you're born, and you're also another year old when you get to January 1. My wife
                    was eight, but when asked this question she put up ten fingers, and was put in
                    the fifth grade, and she didn't speak a word of English and was put in the fifth
                    grade. But she had to adjust, so she went on and always graduated early, she got
                    out of college by the time she was 20, and went on to graduate school.</p>
                <p>Anyway, her experiences were amusing and enriching, and she wrote a book for
                    children called In the Year of the Boar and Jackie Robinson. It's symbolism in
                    the title, its how you continue to be Chinese, but also become an American, and
                    also how Jackie Robinson stands for the best of America, and how baseball
                    symbolizes America where you're both an individual and a member of the team.
                    This book has won all kinds of awards, it's a staple in classrooms around the
                    country and has been extraordinarily popular.</p>
                <p>The other books she has written, just quickly to go through this, It was of
                    course dramatic and we'll get to this later, that I was with Kissinger on the
                    first trip to China by any American official in 22 years. Kissinger kept going
                    back in the succeeding years to advance relationships and on one of these trips,
                    in 1973, my wife went back for the first time to China since she had left and
                    saw many of her relatives, and visited her grandfather's grave, and was very
                    moved by the whole experience, and came back deciding to write another book. The
                    only book she had written at this point was Eighth Moon, which was published
                    back in 1964. This was about nine years later.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>She started writing about her relatives, and about China, but realized that if
                    she published it that her relatives might get in trouble with the Communist
                    regime. So she decided to make it a fictional account but realized that she had
                    to go back into Chinese history somewhat, and went back into the end of the 19th
                    century. Then began a novel which then really had no relationship to her actual
                    relatives' experiences, just an inspiration, although many people who read the
                    novel assumed it was a true story of her family history. So she wrote Spring
                    Moon, and this was her first novel. It was an absolute phenomenon when it came
                    out, spread by word-of-mouth. It got fantastic reviews. It was on the New York
                    Times, Publishers Weekly and every other major best selling list for 31 weeks.
                    It got as high as number two in the country in hardback, sold a couple hundred
                    thousand copies, a lot in those days. It was number one in paperback, sold over
                    two million copies. And Alan Pakula, the famous director took an option on it
                    for a movie although he never made it. Again translated into 20 languages, it
                    was a main selection of the Literary Guild, and was just an absolute phenomenon
                    which is still her most famous and beloved book, along with the children book
                    which another generation has equally loved. I mentioned In the Year of the Boar
                    and Jackie Robinson, which was actually published in 1984. Spring Moon was
                    written...well, she took six years writing fiction. She did Eighth Moonin a
                    year, which was non-fiction. Fictions always takes longer, it took about six
                    years.</p>
                <p>We went to China from '85 to '89 and based on her experiences and interviews with
                    various Chinese, she came back and wrote a book which was published in 1990
                    called Legacies: A Chinese Mosaic, which is non-fiction, a combination of
                    stories of Chinese, particularly during the Cultural Revolution up to Tiananmen
                    Square, and her own family histories woven in, so it's both personal and
                    historical, political and cultural. It was chosen by Time Magazine as one of the
                    top ten books of the year. It was a best seller in its own right, I think for
                    nine weeks. It was a Book of the Month Club selection and translated in many
                    languages overseas.</p>
                <p>And then her final book was about a year and a half ago (1996), called The Middle
                    Heart, another novel on China, not a sequel but a more recent period in Chinese
                    history, essentially World War II up to Tiananmen Square. Again, terrific
                    reviews. It sold very well but was not a best seller like her other books. But
                    the compensation is that in addition to many foreign languages, it is going to
                    be on television Hallmark Hall of Fame (with her doing the screenplay - chosen
                    after interview).</p>
                <p>So that's her literary career. Bette also kept up her dancing and taught dance in
                    Geneva when we were there as well as performing in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>And then, in recent years, she has developed a second career in promoting
                    democracy and human rights. She is currently Chairwoman of Freedom House which
                    was set up by Eleanor Roosevelt and Wendell Wilkie to promote freedom around the
                    world and a sense of international responsibility among Americans. She is on the
                    board, appointed by President Clinton, of the Broadcast Board of Governors,
                    which overseas all non-military government radios, Voice of America, Radio Free
                    Europe, Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, Radio Marti, WorldNet, etc. She is on
                    the board of Freedom Forum which promotes freedom of the press around the world.
                    She is on the Kennedy Center Community board, the National Portrait Gallery
                    board. She is up for election to the Council of Foreign Relations board (elected
                    after interview), and she will be on the Channel 13 board in New York (WNET). So
                    she is promoting freedom and human rights and democracy and that's the other
                    part of her career along with writing. Anyway, that's a quick sketch. (After the
                    interview Bette was awarded the first Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Award by
                    President Clinton at the White House.)</p>

                        youPolitical-Military tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I think it was the end of the calendar year, so I was due then to go
                    overseas. I was assigned tentatively to go to Winnipeg, Canada. It may have been
                    Windsor. I'll be very honest, this did not excite me. I love the Canadians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was offered the Consul Generalship in Winnipeg at one
                        point,and I just couldn't bring myself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: It was one of those two. It was a rather dry border consulate. You probably
                    couldn't get away with this very much in the Foreign Service anymore, but at the
                    time politely I said, “Well, my wife is pregnant, due in March 1964.” Elizabeth
                    Pillsbury was born March 24, 1964. Our second child was Winston Bao Lord, born
                    October 19, 1967. So it was 10 months after our wedding. We hadn't planned
                    something quite that quick but by this time my wife was getting quite pregnant
                    and so I said, could I have one more year in Washington before we go overseas?
                    Which I wanted to do because she was pregnant, but also I figured that was a
                    clever way to escape going to a Canadian consulate border town, although hasten
                    to add, I love the Canadians.</p>
                <p>And my wish was granted because they were looking at that point for people for
                    the Kennedy Round of Trade Negotiations. Before going to Geneva to pursue the
                    negotiations with other countries, there was a need to get ready for a year,
                    there wasn't action yet in Geneva to do it. We were detailed, in fact, to the
                    Office of the U.S. Special Trade Representative, USTR, although working in the
                    State Department, essentially Foreign Service officers, but reporting to William
                    Roth who was the top trade representative, and his deputy Mike Blumenthal.
                    Therefore for the calendar year of 1964 I worked with the U.S. trade
                    representative, essentially in the Economic Bureau, but detailed to USTR.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>I was assigned to the team that was going to negotiate with EEC, it was then
                    called, European Economic Community. Various teams, one for Japan, one for
                    Canada, one for the EEC, one for the other free trade countries in Europe, one
                    for the Latin American countries, etc. So my immediate boss was a senior FSO, Al
                    Pappano, and I was sort of the executive secretary of the little team for the
                    EEC. We spent that year getting ready to go to Geneva, getting ready for the
                    real negotiations, compiling statistics, negotiating positions, strategy. I
                    welcomed this because it got me into the world of economics. I'd taken some
                    economics at Fletcher, but I basically had been very delinquent on that front.
                    So I figured, even though frankly I was not as interested in economics as I was
                    politics or political-military affairs. I figured this was good exposure for me,
                    and frankly I thought it was going to be a year in Washington and then six
                    months, or maybe a year in Geneva. So I welcomed the chance that we could stay
                    in Washington and avoid Windsor/Winnipeg, have our baby, and spend the year
                    getting ready and working on economic matters. It also allowed Bette to finish
                    Eight Moonbefore we went abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the overall thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: This was the negotiations under the GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs
                    and Trade. There had been every few years a general negotiation. The GATT was
                    one of the post-World War II organizations set up to regulate trade among
                    nations, and to try to free trade among nations. Every now and then instead of
                    plodding along with various bilateral negotiations around the world, the feeling
                    was to have a global negotiation with everyone who is a member of GATT getting
                    together and try to have a global agreement. It had also the virtue of while you
                    engaged in that, which usually took a lot of time, did hold off protectionist
                    pressures in various countries because they were saying, well, we're now going
                    into a negotiation and maybe we can free things up. So it had a way of freezing
                    whatever tariff levels there were at the time, and tariffs were the most
                    important although non-tariff barriers were beginning to get important, and
                    keeping things from getting worse. So President Kennedy proposed that we have
                    another one of these rounds and try to free up trade. There had been at least
                    one before that in the '50s, I forget what it was called. We were in the process
                    of getting ready for that.</p>
                <p>Of course, it turned out that - and we'll get into this - it lasted much longer
                    than we expected. When I went to Geneva thinking it was going to be about a
                    year, it turned out to be two and a half years, and the only reason it was ever
                    concluded was because American legislative authority to negotiate, granted by
                    the Congress was going to run out on June 30, 1967. So that turned out to be a
                    deadline which speeded up the negotiations the last six months or year.</p>
                <p>Q: As you were getting ready on your team, were you, I mean you and your team,
                    looking ahead to see what the problems were going to be with the European
                    Economic Community?</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes, it was true that year, but it became even more frustrating when we got
                    to Geneva. It was a very slow pace in negotiations, and the primary reason was
                    because the EEC could not get its act together, primarily because of France.
                    Generally you had the British, the Dutch, etc, traditionally looking for fairly
                    forthcoming liberal trading positions, and the French to a certain extent and I
                    believe the Italians were dragging their feet. I guess the Germans also were for
                    free trade. But they had to get a consensus and so we really spent a good part
                    of certainly that year waiting, when things were still preparatory, so it wasn't
                    so vivid. But once we got to Geneva it was much more clear that we were just
                    waiting on the Europeans to come forward with decent positions. Since they were
                    so central to the negotiations, they held up the overall Kennedy Round. The fact
                    is that you were juggling several balls at once. The fact that nobody could
                    negotiate with the EEC was holding up the overall negotiation. So we essentially
                    treaded water while they battled within the EEC, and the French were always
                    introducing a protectionist element. Getting ready in Washington consisted, as I
                    say, of compiling statistics, figuring out what our objectives were, what
                    tariffs and other barriers to trade we wanted to try to remove, what we were
                    willing to give up, consulting I'm sure with domestic interests, dealing with
                    Congress, and just generally shaping strategy for the negotiations. Then we went
                    to Geneva and continued that, and began to interact with other countries but
                    basically it was very slow going the first year or two in Geneva. This was
                    terrific for my tennis game which I managed to sharpen. I won one of the major
                    club tournaments there, and my tennis has never been as good ever since. We did
                    a lot of traveling in Europe, it was very frustrating waiting around for the
                    Europeans. So it was a slow period in 1965 and most of '66.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's stick to the U.S. preparations. Were you particularly aware of anything
                    that was almost sacrosanct that you knew politically you couldn't mess around
                    with?</p>
                <p>LORD: It's hard to remember in detail now. Certainly textiles was always going to
                    be tough. We had certain agricultural problems as well I'm sure in terms of U.S.
                    protection. But I don't recall in further detail than that.</p>
                <p>Q: You know you're talking about the problems with the EEC, and particularly
                    France. This was more than 30 years ago. Today if you were to talk about
                    anything, you'd still be saying the problems with the European Union, of getting
                    anything out of it is mainly because of France.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>LORD: That's true. In the first place you have a generic problem, and that is the
                    following, although we were in favor of the EEC then, and we still are in favor
                    of a united Europe now. We think on the balance that having a stronger Europe
                    promotes our national interests. Nevertheless, it presents a negotiating
                    dilemma. While they are constructing their own positions, and negotiating among
                    themselves, they won't talk to you very much because they have to get their act
                    together to present a united front. So you try to have some influence while
                    they're shaping their common position but that's very difficult. They feel this
                    is an internal matter, and they've got to reach some internal consensus. Then
                    when they reach a consensus, and have a common position, it's very hard to get
                    them to change it. Because they sweated and labored to get to their common
                    posture, then you take them on and in effect they say, this is the best we can
                    do having compromised among ourselves. It's very hard to get them to move
                    backwards. So you have trouble negotiating with them before they have a common
                    position, you have trouble moving them after they have a common position.</p>
                <p>Then on top of that, of course, it means that since they have to have consensus
                    the most recalcitrant and slow moving and protectionist in the group holds up
                    the others. And this was invariably France, and, although I don't want to be
                    unfair to Italy, it includes Italy as well. But certainly France was the major
                    culprit - generally, and with particular emphasis on their agriculture problems.
                    And that has been a common theme ever since. In fact, the French can be a
                    difficult for us in diplomacy generally, not just on trade, but on many other
                    matters where with de Gaulle and since they like to show their independence of
                    the U.S. and the greatness of France, and they have continued to be difficult. I
                    was at a meeting a few months ago where Mickey Kantor was having a retrospective
                    on negotiating...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was our...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: He was our special trade representative under President Clinton through his
                    first term. He was asked who was the toughest negotiating partner country that
                    we faced. People expected him to say Japan, or maybe China and he immediately
                    said France. That was certainly true in Geneva as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any issues that came...in a way you were
                        part of the internal negotiating procedures in the United States. We had to
                        come up with a fixed position too, and we had our cultural interests, our
                        industrial interests, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>LORD: That's correct. This did not really reach a serious stage until we were in
                    Geneva. Not much went on while we were getting ready in Washington because there
                    wasn't much movement in negotiations. And there was in fighting on an
                    interagency basis I'm sure. I did not take much a part in that. And certainly
                    while we were in Geneva that was done back here with Ambassador Roth when
                    Ambassador Blumenthal headed our delegation in Geneva. And, of course, early on
                    special interests don't want to tip their hand too much or make too many
                    concessions eveinternally until they see what they're going to get from other
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were gathering statistics was everybody sort of
                        lookinover the shoulder of these other groups to see what was coming
                        up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: You mean other countries?</p>
                <p>Q: I mean you have different groups within the State Department and other
                    agencies dealing with Japan or with Canada or Latin America. Were you all
                    working out your thing and just getting together?</p>
                <p>LORD: That's right. I mean, you would work out your strategy versus your
                    counterpart, in my case the EEC, but you had to relate this and talk to the
                    other teams about how they were going to approach Japan and Canada and the
                    others. If you made this concession to the EEC what would it do to your leverage
                    vis-a-vis Canada and Japan, for example. So you had to meld this. I don't
                    believe we did too much of that in Washington. I think the pace just hadn't
                    picked up enough, it was more getting a lot of the statistical background and
                    objectives with other countries in mind. I don't recall that we had detailed
                    strategies at that point. It was probably somewhat premature.</p>
                <p>Q: I must say that just thinking about the thing, it seems impossible just to get
                    everybody to come on board. What was the trade-off?</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, the American market is a big target for other countries in terms of
                    our leverage, even more so today, but in those days as well we were a huge
                    market for countries and therefore they wanted to get into our market. That, of
                    course, was the trade-off we had with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Congressional side of things, was that taken care of
                        adifferent levels?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. I don't recall myself getting involved in that. And again, it wouldn't
                    have been too frantic in the early stages while we were in Washington. Indeed,
                    that would be done at higher levels, and particularly as we went down the home
                    stretch it was done in Washington at high levels.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Q: Did you get any feel for the operation of the Department as far as the
                    contributions of the various bureaus, all of the geographic bureaus, the
                    Economic Bureau, for what you all were doing?</p>
                <p>LORD: I don't recall right now great precision. Certainly there were no
                    information problems. Whenever we needed information we could get it. But I
                    don't have a clear recollection of exactly what we did day-to-day frankly,
                    except as I say get a sense of all the negotiating areas, the barriers that we
                    faced abroad, what our priorities were, and some sense of what we'd be willing
                    to do and a lot of statistical stuff about trade patterns, and projections, etc.
                    The overall team consisted of people seconded from other agencies. It wasn't
                    just the State Department. So we drew heavily on Commerce and Agriculture, as
                    well as the State Department bureaus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your team sit down and say how are we going to get the
                        French, how are we going to work with the French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, again, this heated up more when we got to Geneva, but yes, a lot of
                    it was how do we work in individual capitals to try to influence them. So we'd
                    go with circular telegrams to the British and the Dutch, and the Italians and
                    the Germans as well as the French tailoring our positions either to encourage
                    liberalization by some, or try to encourage the French to be more forthcoming.
                    But as I said, it's rather difficult because they felt that they had to sort out
                    their own position before they could really talk seriously to us. So my clear
                    recollection, particularly as we got to Geneva, was one of frustration that we
                    couldn't speed up the process in the EEC. Every time we thought there was
                    movement there would be some EEC meeting and the French and perhaps others would
                    once again kill the possible compromise.</p>
                <p>Q: Sometimes, of course, the French may have been almost a stalking horse because
                    the Germans certainly have had a highly subsidized agricultural sector too.</p>
                <p>LORD: It wasn't just agriculture that they were dragging their feet on. It was
                    the industrial area as well, and I'm sure there were certain areas that the
                    Germans or even the more liberal members of the EEC wanted to protect and
                    sometimes they would conveniently hide behind the French. So I don't want to put
                    this all on the French. But I distinctly remember, and I'm sure it's accurate,
                    that the French were the real culprits.</p>

                <p>LORD: We went in January of '65, I remember in those days we had the luxury of
                    going by ship, it was wonderful and I love boats. I remember I was crushed the
                    U.S. shipping line, I guess it was the United States had a strike. So I said, oh
                    my God we don't get to go on a boat. Well, it turned out to be a plus because we
                    were then authorized to take a foreign ship. So instead of speeding across in
                    the United States, the United States would cross the Atlantic in five
                    days...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The United States was our fastest ship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's right. We had to take an Italian boat, Leonardo da Vinci, which took
                    ten days. So we had twice as much fun, and twice the time, it was wonderful.
                    Wonderful food, and very pleasant. On that ship I met Bill Buckley, the famous
                    Bill Buckley, a conservative commentator, TV, a Yale person. I expected him, by
                    reputation, to be pompous and not to listen and to be didactic, and to be cold.
                    He was just the opposite of all these things. He and his wife were extremely
                    friendly and warm, and we have had a lifelong friendship with them ever since.
                    Anyway, we went over there with our young daughter. My parents went with us, so
                    we had a lot of fun. We had a terrific time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: January 1965 until June 30, 1967. So when I first took the job in
                    Washington I figured at most I would be there six months or maybe a year. Even
                    as we went over we thought it would be about a year or so, and it turned out to
                    be two and a half years with very little happening frankly until about the last
                    year, and only then because of the impending deadline of the U.S. legislative
                    authority running out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It does point out this thing in negotiations that at a
                        certaipoint you really have to say after this no more.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's right, and I don't know if these ever would have been concluded
                    without this deadline. Obviously we were crucial to the whole operation.
                    Everyone knew that we couldn't go back to our Congress and get new authority.
                    That we had to wrap it up by then, particularly after so many years of
                    negotiations. And thus it was this deadline that was used by the two heroes at
                    that negotiation to complete it. One hero was Mike Blumenthal, who did an
                    extraordinary job. The other hero was the Director General of the GATT, a man
                    named Eric Wyndham White. And the two of them really pulled this off down the
                    home stretch. We can get to that in just a minute.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Q: Can you talk about developments from your perspective of this extremely
                    important set of negotiations, because almost everything from now on was with
                    built on that.</p>
                <p>LORD: That's correct. There has been subsequent rounds, and the Tokyo Round, and
                    then the Uruguay Round patterned after that. They always take time because by
                    definition it's complicated. You've got all the major trading partners, all the
                    interests at work, and we were trying not only get tariffs reduced, but begin to
                    take a crack at non-tariff barriers. But this was the last negotiation where the
                    tariffs were the overwhelmingly important item, and the end result was very
                    successful. At the time we thought it was somewhat less than ideal. It was good,
                    but we'd hoped to have even more. But looking back on it was a remarkable
                    achievement what was finally pulled off. I was again the secretary, or executive
                    secretary for the EEC negotiating team up until the last year, so the first year
                    and a half. For maybe the last nine months, I don't remember exactly, I switched
                    jobs with Tom Simons, another distinguished Foreign Service officer who had been
                    in my A-100 course, and has since has gone on to be ambassador to Poland and a
                    very high ranking Soviet expert and ambassador to Pakistan right now. So he came
                    over and took my job on the EEC team, and I went over and took his job as
                    special assistant to Mike Blumenthal for the last nine months. But before that
                    from early '65 until toward the end of '66, it was very slow moving. Terrific
                    for my tennis game, and a lot of skiing and traveling. I worked eight hour days
                    but no longer than that, and often we had to make work. We were sitting around
                    running statistics, waiting for the EEC essentially to get its act together.
                    Every now and then I would write a memo to Pappano sort of suggesting, here's a
                    way we might break the deadlock. I once suggested, for example, that rather
                    inching along with gradual trading off with the EEC, why don't we put all our
                    offers on the table at once, conditional on getting a major response from them.
                    It was probably a wrong approach, but I just wanted to try to think of things to
                    try to get things moving, and what might speed up the process. So occasionally
                    I'd write what I thought were some interesting memos like that, but most of the
                    time we were doing statistics, and it was very hard to keep busy throughout the
                    day. Very frustrating.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: The overall delegation was, of course, but our job really was with the EEC
                    and obviously in Geneva. I don't think I ever traveled to Brussels. Our job was
                    to deal with the EEC. There would be long periods of time we didn't even have
                    meetings because they didn't have a position. So socially we would run into
                    Japanese, Canadians, Latin Americans, and others. But the other teams were doing
                    the negotiating with them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's correct.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: He was extraordinary. I've been fortunate in working for very dynamic
                    leaders of very different styles, that includes Fred Dutton that I mentioned.
                    Jeff Kitchen and Alexis Johnson were very impressive in their own way. Mike
                    Blumenthal was extraordinary. Then I worked for Henry Kissinger at one point and
                    many others, George Shultz and Warren Christopher. So it has been a real
                    variety. Blumenthal was a Jewish emigree from Nazi Germany through Shanghai, a
                    little ironic since my wife was born in Shanghai. He had taught at Princeton, a
                    Ph.D., and a distinguished education background in economics. He had been head
                    of Bendix Corporation.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: I don't remember who would have appointed him - Kennedy being assassinated
                    in '63, I think he must have been appointed by Johnson. I just don't recall
                    exactly. Ambassador Roth was the other special trade representative, and then
                    became number one, I believe after Christian Herter died. He sat in Washington
                    but occasionally would visit Geneva for negotiations, but of course Blumenthal
                    was head of our delegation sitting in Geneva. He was very young for that kind of
                    senior responsibility. At the time he must have been mid-thirties, late thirties
                    at the most. He brought both a business and an academic background. Very
                    dynamic, very courageous in taking on Washington when he wanted to get some
                    concessions for negotiating purposes, very tough with the other countries as
                    well, very demanding of his staff in a good way but demanding excellence, very
                    hard working, and a very brilliant tactician. He realized that he had to use our
                    negotiating deadline to try to finally bring this thing to a close, and worked
                    very closely with the Director General of GATT, Wyndham White to try to do
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>As his special assistant I was responsible for making sure that various cables
                    and other bits of information got to him. I'd be note taker in some of his
                    meetings. I would do occasional think pieces for him. I would be a channel of
                    communication for other members of the staff. I also had access to very
                    sensitive cables, sensitive in the sense of a commercial negotiating position
                    that we didn't want to leak out, so they'd be sent in special channels with
                    special code words. Even then we used NODIS and LIMDIS, but we had a code word,
                    I think was “potatoes” for some reason. I'd be the first to learn that it had
                    come in and only he and maybe one or two other people would see these cables. It
                    meant, for example, you are authorized if you need it to make this concession on
                    this sector, of this area, which would have been dynamite if it went out to the
                    domestic industry. So this sounded like a nuclear secret but it was almost as
                    sensitive. I remember a couple of times I would even get woken at home - we were
                    living at that time at Versoix which is about 15 minutes from our Geneva
                    mission. We first lived in Annemasse on the other side of the lake. I remember a
                    couple of times being woken in the middle of the night by the embassy's
                    communications operator, getting an urgent message from Washington. I didn't
                    mind doing it but I'd go in there and it would be some negotiating position
                    which certainly could have waited until the next day. It had the requirement, if
                    it's NIACT immediate, you've got to open it and act on it right away. Sometimes
                    it wouldn't even be needed for a week or so, so I used to get furious with the
                    White House. Francis Baton, who I have great respect for, was Deputy National
                    Security Advisor in charge of economics and trade working for Walt Rostow at
                    that point. Either he or his staff had the bad judgment in sending NIACT
                    immediate occasionally in the middle of the night and make me drive in and it
                    could have waited for a week let alone a day.</p>
                <p>In any event, this was heady stuff. Finally we were on the move. Finally there
                    was real negotiation of give and take, and of course sitting in the front office
                    I could see all the negotiations, not just the EEC but with all the other major
                    partners. I could also see the equally dramatic negotiations with Washington
                    where Blumenthal was trying to get more negotiating flexibility. He'd often go
                    back to Washington to press the various agencies and the White House to get more
                    flexibility, and the kind of deals he was suggesting. So it was a tremendous
                    education for me on negotiating in general, on economic negotiating in
                    particular, on dealing with Washington on domestic politics, and the play of
                    various interests, and juggling your interest with various interlocutors in
                    Geneva, on how to play off the EEC, Japan and Canada, and other major
                    negotiating partners, and how to gang up with some against others, to try to get
                    movement. So it was a very heady, exciting period and the last nine months in
                    many ways made up for the general drag of the first almost two years.</p>
                <p>Q: Was the United States the driving force the whole time?</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>LORD: I think it's fair to say that, but clearly down the home stretch it was
                    Blumenthal and Wyndham White, the latter, of course, being more neutral but
                    working behind the scenes with Blumenthal. So we clearly were the driving force
                    unquestionably. Blumenthal personally deserves great credit for the deal he
                    brought off. Obviously Ambassador Roth was important sitting in Washington, but
                    anyone would tell you that without Blumenthal on the scene there this never
                    would have happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What brought people together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: First the deadline concentrated the minds. We made concessions, they made
                    concessions. People realized, even the French grudgingly, that it was in
                    everyone's interest to have this thing succeed. And that if we didn't the world
                    probably would have slid back into protectionism, and it would have hurt
                    everyone. Obviously there were some areas like European agriculture, and some
                    other areas, where we never could make a dent. They probably didn't make much
                    progress on textiles. I don't recall the details. So as you got down the home
                    stretch, you began to see what things really had to be excluded from the final
                    negotiations, or where you needed gradual tariff reduction on a much slower
                    pace. And there'd be difficult areas domestically which you finally would make
                    concessions on as long as you got something in return that you could use to
                    justify the concessions you were making. So it was a multilateral process. I
                    think it's fair to say that on the whole Canada was certainly reinforcing us.
                    The free trade area countries in Europe, outside the EEC, the European countries
                    outside the EEC, EFTA, was an important part, also for free trade on the whole.
                    Japan, it's hard to think they were free trade, but I don't think they were as
                    recalcitrant as the French- led EEC. Australia and New Zealand were for open
                    trade. The developing countries had their own problems and generally weren't
                    expected to do as much. So you had a lot of multilateral pressure to get this
                    thing done. There was the combination of deadline, people seeing the gains they
                    would make by opening others' markets and the dangers of failure and sliding
                    back into protectionism if we didn't succeed, as well as the possible political
                    overtones and bitterness among friends. I think all this plus the negotiating
                    skill of Blumenthal and the steering skill and leadership of Wyndham White
                    brought this to a head.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the real negotiation taking place? I would think
                        thathe big table of everybody sitting around would be...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Absolutely not. They usually would ratify things, as you say, and be more
                    be more for propaganda exchanges. So it would take place in small meetings,
                    maybe one-on-one heads of delegations, Blumenthal seeing the head of EEC
                    one-on-one, or maybe with me or somebody else taking notes. Or Wyndham White
                    bringing people together, some key delegate heads, so it would be in small
                    groups and sometimes bilaterally and sometimes small multilateral groups. But
                    you're absolutely right, it wouldn't be a formal thing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, I was although when I became special assistant I sat in on some of
                    those meetings. But it was more apt to be either Blumenthal alone, or the head
                    of the negotiating team, the head of the EEC team or the Canadian team, etc.,
                    that would be sitting in there. So I don't believe I sat in on too many of those
                    but I was in some of them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well at times. Blumenthal, like a skilled negotiator knew how to play his
                    cards, when to reveal his own concessions, when to be tough, when to threaten to
                    walk away. But he would liven it with humor and politeness as necessary. But he
                    could be very tough, and there were times, particularly with the EEC, and
                    occasion with the Japanese as well, there would be table pounding. My
                    recollection would be that the EFTA countries and Canada and the developing
                    countries were easier to deal with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were intellectual rights an issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Not at all. I don't recall it being a major issue. They have become more
                    and more important in American negotiations as we have gotten into the
                    information age, globalization, American competitive edge. Whether its software,
                    pharmaceuticals, or technological and scientific, or literary intellectual
                    property rights, all that has become a major market where we have a comparative
                    advantage in recent years. It has really moved up on our priority list of our
                    negotiations. In fact, in the Kennedy Round it was not, it was more the
                    traditional industrial and agricultural tariff areas that were our main focus
                    then. Machinery, chemicals, grains, these kind of things were the major
                    center-pieces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about on the agricultural side? We had our
                        subsidies,everybody else had their subsidiaries.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>LORD: I don't believe much progress was made. I'd have to go back, I'm sure there
                    are exhaustive records, the EC was not going to move very much in its policy. So
                    I think there were some modest gains in certain areas. Of course, this was very
                    important, not only for us but for Canada, Argentina, and for other countries.
                    So it was hard for some of those countries, in particular. We had very great
                    agricultural interests, but for the Canadians or for Argentina and maybe some of
                    the other free trade area countries (EFTA) agriculture was absolutely crucial.
                    So the EEC was dragging its feet, but agriculture was not only frustrating for
                    us, but it threatened the overall negotiations. So there was some modest gains,
                    but as I recall, the Kennedy Round did not make much progress on agriculture
                    compared to the industrial side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a last minute thing, or were you beginning to see
                        light athe end of this particular tunnel as the negotiations
                        progressed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, again, this goes back as you say and this is 30 years, but you had
                    ups and downs. It was a roller-coaster for the last nine months where there were
                    days where you felt, well we're going to make it. And other days, how the hell
                    are we going to make it by June 30, 1967. And I recall that it really went down
                    to the wire. Even a week before the deadline we weren't sure we were going to
                    make it, and it got very dramatic and very exciting the last few weeks, and I'm
                    sure there have been memoirs by Blumenthal and others that will detail this. But
                    I do know it was a roller-coaster for several months. There were times when we
                    were very worried that we were not going to pull this off. Other times when we
                    felt we had momentum. It really went down to the wire.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought this would have been a difficult thing career-wise since
                    there are Foreign Service cycles where you get assigned, and to be in something
                    sort of open-ended as this you really couldn't feel you could bail out. I mean,
                    most Foreign Service assignments come up in the spring and people move in the
                    summer.</p>
                <p>LORD: That's a very good point. That was an additional frustration in not having
                    an awful lot to do and waiting for the EEC. There was the feeling that this was
                    supposed to be a two year assignment. In those days in the Foreign Service your
                    first three assignments generally were about two years each, and you rotated
                    even within an embassy, and they tried to expose you in many areas. So I had a
                    feeling that three and a half years on trade negotiations was more than I wanted
                    to invest, and as a general principle early in my career. It was slow moving.
                    Two years of economics and trade would have been perfect, but three and a half
                    years in any job at that point was really slowing me down. After nine months in
                    Congressional Relations, a year and a quarter in Political-Military affairs, I
                    felt like the clock had stopped. Now having said that, I was very fortunate on
                    promotions although I like to think I earned them. But I got three promotions in
                    the first five and a half years. So I was moving as fast as you possibly
                    could.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were beyond the threshold at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I forget what the system was then. I started as what they called a FSO-8, I
                    remember my first salary I think was $5200 a year. I went to 7, and then to 6,
                    and then to 5. By the time I left Geneva I was an FSO-5. Which brings me to a
                    career decision at that point, unless you have other questions on the Kennedy
                    Round, this might be a good place to end it up at this point. We knew we would
                    be finished one way or another by June 30, 1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At least you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: For my next assignment I asked for a job that would be first political, and
                    secondly in Asia. Looking at it in retrospect, the Foreign Service was
                    forthcoming. My assignment was Malaysia in the political section. However, I was
                    not that enthusiastic. First, I had, despite the excitement of the last nine
                    months, the frustrations of the year and a half or two years before that. There
                    was also my general observation of how slow it was to get real responsibility.
                    Now, this was perhaps unfair. After all I'd been promoted three times, I'd
                    gotten first Congressional Relations, then Political-Military, then economics
                    and I had gotten the Seventh Floor, I had avoided the Canada assignment. So
                    really objectively I really couldn't complain except for the slowdown in Geneva.
                    And I ended up being Special Assistant there and one likes to think Blumenthal
                    chose me because he thought I was doing well in my other jobs. So I was right in
                    the center of affairs and it was very exciting the last nine months. So
                    objectively you'd think on the whole I'd be pretty happy.</p>
                <p>But here I was just about 30 at that point, just short of 30. I always said when
                    I went in the Foreign Service that I would give it roughly three assignments,
                    maybe one at home and two abroad, roughly six years, when I would be 30 and then
                    I would make a strategic decision because I was determined not to just stay in
                    out of habit and out of security, but to make sure I was getting responsibility
                    and being intellectually and professionally challenged. And I knew when I went
                    in there was some grumbling about it took a long while before you did anything
                    but stamp visas or you had real responsibility. And I was determined not to get
                    bogged down.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>So I faced a decision in June of 1967. The Malaysia political assignment looked
                    like it was responding to my request, and I'm sure the Service felt so. On the
                    other hand, it was the number four position in a political section. I was a
                    little naive, the chances are that at least two of those positions above me were
                    CIA. But I looked at it and said, wait a second. I've had three promotions, I've
                    been in almost six years, I'm almost 30, and what is my next job? The fourth
                    person, not in the embassy in Malaysia, but the fourth person in a political
                    section in embassy Malaysia. With all due respect to Malaysia, how much
                    political work could there be? This is back in 1967. So what's the number four
                    guy going to do? Plus, it meant studying Malaysian, a relatively easy language,
                    but taking a year or two out to study Malaysian. I wouldn't have minded Chinese,
                    or French, or something that I felt was going to be useful, but I figured
                    Malaysian was not going to be something I'd use throughout my career. So I
                    figured I've already spent a couple of years in Geneva treading water. I've got
                    to spend another year or two taking language, then I'm going to be the fourth
                    person in a political section at a small post. I said, now wait a second, is
                    this what I want to do? I was somewhat undecided.</p>
                <p>And here's where my wife comes in. We've had a fantastic marriage and just for
                    the record, we've been very lucky. Among the reasons it has been fantastic in
                    addition to the emotional side is the professional side; at key moments in my
                    career she has steered me in the right direction. I'll name three before I
                    forget it. This was the first one. She said look, you're in danger despite the
                    success you've had and this last assignment as Special Assistant, you are not
                    gaining great intellectual advancement. You're in danger of becoming blunted in
                    your enthusiasm and your intellectual maturity and even becoming a vegetable.
                    She didn't put it quite that dramatically. You really ought to think whether
                    this is the time to get out or not, and for all the reasons I've mentioned, the
                    language training, for a non-useful language, the number four in the political
                    section. And she had seen a lot of the frustrations in Geneva. So she was a
                    heavy influence on me.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>By coincidence, I believe it was literally the last day we were there, June 30,
                    1967, when I was still debating what to do, I got a phone call from Les Gelb.
                    Les Gelb is now president of the Council of Foreign Relations. He was also in
                    the Foreign Service as a political appointment, head of the Political-Military
                    Bureau under President Carter. He has been a New York Times columnist. He had
                    worked with Senator Javits. He was calling me because he was about to go into
                    the Pentagon in the Policy Planning Staff in International Security Affairs
                    under Mort Halperin, who was in his late twenties and the youngest Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary almost in the government. He asked me would I be interested
                    in going in as a civil servant into this new exciting office. I was debating it,
                    my wife urged me to take it and leave the Foreign Service. I was half ready to
                    leave. I had affection for the Service, I had no complaints about how I had been
                    treated, in promotions, or for that matter even assignments. But the inherent
                    frustrations of the slow moving up the ladder to real responsibility faced me
                    with a stark choice, and I had told myself that at the age of 30, after six
                    years and three assignments, I would make a strategic decision. My wife held me
                    to it, and whether I would have had the guts to do this move at that point
                    without her encouragement, I don't know. But she certainly was decisive. I
                    temporized on these points as I thought about it, and then as I went back on the
                    boat again with my parents we decided I should do it. So I left the Foreign
                    Service the summer of 1967.</p>
                <p>Before I forget. The other two moments, and we'll get into it later in our
                    history making here, that she steered me in my career. The obvious right courses
                    that anybody else in their right minds would have pressed. One is when Kissinger
                    asked me to be his Special Assistant in 1970. I was sitting in the Executive
                    Office Building and Al Haig relayed the invitation and I turned it down because
                    I didn't want to work that hard. And she said I was out of my mind to miss an
                    opportunity like this.</p>
                <p>And then the other one was when I was offered by the National Security Advisor,
                    Bud McFarlane, and Secretary of State George Shultz to become ambassador to
                    China in 1985. And I said I preferred a job in Washington. My wife said, you're
                    crazy not to be ambassador to China. So in leaving the Service, then becoming
                    Special Assistant to Kissinger, which was the turning point in my career, and
                    then going to China as ambassador, in each case my wife was very influential in
                    helping me.III. DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (1967-1969)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you resigned from the Foreign Service. How was this
                        done?Was it a problem going from a past service to the civil service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>LORD: No particular problem. I submitted my resignation, made it very clear that
                    I had great respect and affection for the Service and thought I'd been treated
                    well but wanted to take this opportunity to strike out on a new path. And as I
                    said, privately my real reason was to try to be challenged more quickly. Plus,
                    what I'd heard about the office being set up in the Pentagon made it sound like
                    a very exciting place. The lead was going to be Morton Halperin, who was a
                    brilliant young academic, had been at Harvard, worked with Henry Kissinger. At
                    the time was only about 27-28 years old. Les Gelb, to be Mort's deputy, was a
                    very good friend of my wife from Tufts University and was to become a friend of
                    mine. I knew how bright he was, and he was telling me about other people who
                    were going into the office. This was in the era still of the McNamara hot-shots,
                    although he had been in office for some time. And along with systems analysis,
                    the bright young people were going into this policy planning staff. So for all
                    these reasons I decided to take a chance. I don't recall the details. I just was
                    appointed as a GS-level, relatively low. I had to take the equivalent to what I
                    was as a Foreign Service officer, and I think it was probably about GS-11 or 12,
                    I don't recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was called ISA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: International Security Affairs which is in effect, and it still is today,
                    ISA, in effect the State Department of the Pentagon. It is the interface with
                    the State Department and the White House, and anything having to do with
                    diplomacy, Political-Military Affairs. It had been the counterpart of
                    Political-Military Affairs in the State Department, a sort of semi-Pentagon of
                    the State Department. So I had seen it from the other end. This was a policy
                    planning staff set up reporting to the Assistant Secretary for International
                    Security Affairs who was a man named John McNaughton, a brilliant person who
                    died in an aircraft accident just as I was coming in. His place was taken by
                    Paul Warnke. His deputy was a man named Townsend Hoopes who later went on to
                    become Under Secretary of the Air Force. They wanted a policy planning staff. I
                    don't know whether there had been one before, or whether this was a new
                    organization being set up that could look ahead, that could challenge
                    conventional wisdom, and it had a global mandate although it turned out to be
                    heavily involved in Vietnam. And indeed, Les Gelb, the deputy to Halperin was
                    the director of the Pentagon Papers which of course became quite famous a couple
                    of years later.</p>

                <p>LORD: Technically I left June 30th from Geneva, went back on a boat with my
                    parents, a couple of things intervened before I started actually after Labor
                    Day. We took a little vacation, visited my brother and his wife in Guatemala
                    where he was on business and both my wife and his wife were pregnant at the same
                    time. My son was coming along and was born October 19, 1967. Then I had an
                    operation. So I didn't start until Labor Day.</p>

                    Vietnam. But using Labor Day of '67, one, did it intrude into the GATT
                    negotiations. What was your feeling towards Vietnam when you arrived in the
                    Pentagon?</p>
                <p>LORD: While we were in Geneva from the beginning of '65 to the middle of '67
                    obviously America's involvement in the war under Johnson and generally the
                    controversy was growing. I think still by '67 the majority of the American
                    people and even the Congress was behind what we were doing. This was as you
                    recall pre-Tet. It was becoming more and more controversial. I recall distinctly
                    in Geneva debates at dinner parties and cocktail parties about Vietnam. So it
                    had already started and the debates were quite heated. My attitude at the time
                    was I would say moderate hawk. I felt that our objectives were correct in the
                    sense that we had to worry about the spread of communism in Asia. And certainly
                    our motives were noble. I was well aware that the South Vietnamese government
                    was not a pure Jeffersonian democracy. But I was also aware that North Vietnam
                    and the Viet Cong were hardly model citizens either. And I felt that whatever
                    our tactics, that our motives at least were enlightened both in terms of the
                    self interest, and in terms of trying to protect people from invasion.</p>
                <p>Therefore, like the administration and the President I was in favor of a somewhat
                    middle course which in retrospect people all said was a big mistake, namely, we
                    either should have gone all out to win, or we shouldn't have gotten involved in
                    the first place. The President kept doing just enough to keep us going and stave
                    off the defeat but never enough to bring it to a conclusion. And I certainly was
                    not critical of that. So my position was generally defending our intervention. I
                    felt it was essentially an invasion of the south by the north, not a civil war.
                    And on geopolitical and even moral grounds our position was correct. But I was
                    not an all-out hawk, win at any price. That's basically where I was in Geneva. I
                    was as an American concerned about the growing controversy in our society, the
                    growing drain on our attention in terms of our other global responsibilities. I
                    was also concerned about the emerging racial problems. I've always been
                    concerned about that issue. So that domestic dimension was bothering me. But I
                    went into the Pentagon essentially as supporter of the administration
                    policy.</p>
                <p>Q: When you went in there, there had been probably something else, sort of the
                    equivalent but not of the same stature or structure as the ISA, I assume the
                    Pentagon had to have something to deal with State.</p>
                <p>LORD: ISA had been around for some time, I believe. I don't knoabout the policy
                    planning section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were coming in...it was policy planning?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>LORD: It was the policy planning staff of the International Security Affairs
                    division which is an Assistant Secretary-led division in the Pentagon. So the
                    Assistant Secretary, who I've named, would report to the deputy and the
                    Secretary of Defense. The deputy at that time I believe being Paul Nitze, and
                    the number one person, of course, being McNamara. While I was there, of course,
                    Clifford took over. So the ISA perspective on Vietnam was diplomatic, the
                    negotiations such as they were, our relations with other countries, again
                    working with the State Department and the White House. Whereas the Office of
                    Systems Analysis in the Pentagon, which had a lot of the whiz kids, would be
                    more responsible for how are we doing in the war, casualties, the effect of air
                    power, strategy. Of course, you had other parts of the Pentagon that were also
                    relevant. But as the name suggests, it was Systems Analysis, analyzing the
                    objective progress or lack of it in the war, while we were more on the
                    negotiation side, and the international dimensions.</p>
                <p>Let me immediately point out that this was not the only thing that Policy
                    Planning staff did. This was a global mandate. It so happened that since that
                    was obviously the overwhelming foreign policy issue at the time, that
                    particularly the leadership in our office, Halperin and Gelb, would be spending
                    a great deal of their time on this issue. There were some very able people on
                    the staff, both colonels and other military officers, academics who had come in.
                    Professor Richard Ullman who is a distinguished professor at Princeton was
                    there, a historian, many other names which I won't try to resurrect at this
                    point. But we had a global mandate. I was asked to do essentially - I don't
                    believe this is the only thing I did - but I essentially followed Asian policy
                    in general which meant some work on Vietnam, but work on our alliances out
                    there, our general Asian policy, and what our strategy should be for the
                    region.</p>
                <p>Q: As you looked at Asia when you came on board, did you have any ideas thinking
                    back in your mind about different approaches we might take? Leaving Vietnam
                    aside.LORD: Well, I thought even then that Asia was of great importance to us. I
                    don't think that even I could foresee how important it would emerge by the
                    1990s. But I was never guilty of being Eurocentric, I felt that Asia deserved a
                    greater slice of our attention and our engagement. I've already said that I
                    supported our general posture in the war, not only for our global position but
                    for our position in Asia, and to give the countries in the region time to
                    develop. I'd have to say that I was not vigorously in favor of an opening to
                    China at that point, which is important to state given the fact that I was so
                    involved later in my career. I was not Joe McCarthy-like in my dislike or my
                    distrust of China. I must have been aware of Nixon's article which included
                    China in Foreign Affairs magazine in 1967. I don't think anybody realized he was
                    going to carry it to such a dramatic extent but he did indicate that we had to
                    do business with China in that article which coming from him was quite
                    interesting. But it would be dishonest for me to say that in the late '60s I was
                    saying we should open up to China, that will free up our diplomacy in general. I
                    was open to new approaches but I didn't envision the dramatic opportunities of
                    the China opening at that point.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Taking a little tour of the horizon. Asia, did that
                        includIndia at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No. Again, I didn't work just on Asia. I want to make that clear. But I
                    recall that was mostly what I worked on, and I did some think pieces on Asian
                    strategy in general. But we traditionally in the State Department, as you know,
                    and that is also true in the Pentagon, we don't include the sub-continent in our
                    definition of Asia, or specifically, East Asia and the Pacific. So I don't
                    recall doing much work on India, it was basically east of India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Indonesia by this time was sort of considered a safe
                        area.Suharto had been in for about two years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, again as I've told you, I want to be very careful not to try to
                    pretend more than I do remember about specifics and where we were on different
                    issues and policies. I recall thinking that Indonesia was underappreciated given
                    its size and potential importance. I don't recall how much we thought it had
                    stabilized. Obviously, Indonesia together with the rest of Southeast Asia was a
                    major concern for us as we engaged in Vietnam. I would have thought I'm sure
                    that if we lose in Vietnam, if not an automatic domino impact there would
                    nevertheless be an unsettling impact on Indonesia and the other countries in
                    Southeast Asia. It is one of the reasons I generally supported our Vietnam
                    policy. We'll get into this in much more detail as we go along, but in
                    retrospect as one calculates the benefits and the losses of the Vietnam
                    experience, clearly the losses outweigh the benefits. But on the plus side you
                    have to say that we did buy time for Indonesia, for Southeast Asia in general to
                    develop their economies with our having established a buffer against communist
                    influence. And I do believe that the buying of time for Southeast Asia and Asian
                    development generally is one of the pluses of our engagement. If we had never
                    become engaged, and Hanoi had overrun all of Indochina without any opposition in
                    the course of the '60s, I do think without having to subscribe to automatic
                    domino theory, there might well have been other countries falling under
                    communist influence. Our Asian friends agree that we bought them time to develop
                    independently.</p>
                <p>Q: I think it's easy to underestimate the very possible effect, and later of
                    course seeing these other countries strengthening themselves; they no longer had
                    the same momentum later. What about the Philippines, was this a problem? Do you
                    remember anything about Marcos?</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>LORD: I remember at that time, probably having a fairly high opinion of Marcos, I
                    forget when he came into office. And indeed, Marcos did some good things early
                    in his tenure. But like so many Asian leaders, or so many leaders in the world,
                    he didn't know when to quit when he was ahead. So whether its the Shah, or
                    whether its Marcos, or whether its other world leaders, sometimes they do good
                    work for a while, and then greed or corruption, or ego, sets in and they begin
                    to pay for it. So I imagine at that time the Philippines were one of our allies
                    in Vietnam, along with Thailand, Australia, Korea, I forget who else was
                    helping, and we had a pretty positive view of them. But again, it's hard for me
                    to reconstruct 30 years later precisely how we felt about each country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the other two major powers, Japan and Korea?
                        Werthere problems at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No, I think we felt Korea was a pretty good ally in Vietnam. At that point
                    we were nervous about North Korean strength versus South Korea. Today, in the
                    late '90s it's very clear who has won that race, South Korea has just
                    dramatically outstripped and outperformed the North, its gone ahead and the
                    North has gone backwards. But, we tend to forget, that in the '60s in many
                    respects the North not only posed a major military threat to the South, in some
                    respects it looked like it was proceeding economically, at least on pace with
                    South Korea. Maybe we were misled because it was an opaque society even then. So
                    there was that concern, and this is before the miracle in terms of the South
                    Korean economy taking off. But against that backdrop, they had been a good ally
                    in Vietnam. As for Japan it was supporting our effort in Vietnam in terms of
                    bases, etc. It was somewhat nervous. It wasn't an economic power, yet.</p>
                <p>Q: Moving back, you say you had Asia and you had other things, but were you
                    looking at the Soviet Union and how it was dealing with both China and
                    Japan?</p>
                <p>LORD: I just don't recall. I'm sure in the context of Asia I looked at all those
                    countries. I believe I did some work on NATO and Europe but I don't have a
                    precise recollection. Basically, being a Policy Planning Staff, it was more
                    think pieces, or comment on ongoing policies, than it was operational. So our
                    job was to provide information and possibly policy recommendations. Having said
                    that like myself when I was head of Policy Planning in the State Department
                    later, the heads of our office knew that we had to have policy relevance, that
                    if was just a white tower academic operation the leaders in the Pentagon weren't
                    going to pay any attention. There was no question, and it wasn't just on
                    Vietnam, but including Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Halperin and Gelb, often with my support, or supporting paperwork, would get
                    involved in some of the policy debates in the Pentagon on our Vietnam policy.
                    And Halperin and Gelb were of the moderately dovish persuasion, probably
                    somewhat more than I was although these were not major differences, we all
                    wanted a negotiated settlement if it were possible. Nobody wanted immediate
                    withdrawal, there was no radical view there. But there was a skepticism even
                    before Tet that Halperin and Gelb had, I think, about how well we were doing. I
                    had some of that and I must say once I got home from Geneva picked up more of
                    it, both by working in the Pentagon and because, I had access to classified
                    materials. I began to judge what we were saying versus how things were going.
                    And then I had around me American society and the controversy hitting me full
                    blast, and we were insulated from it sitting in Geneva. That was a major
                    cultural change when we returned home having left the beginning of '65 and
                    coming back in the middle of '67. This was a major change in how Americans were
                    thinking and talking about the war. It hadn't reached the proportions of the end
                    of the '60s and the early '70s, but it was clearly a change from very wide
                    support when I left, and some controversy but under control essentially, to a
                    major domestic division and trauma by the time we got back. So for all these
                    reasons I began to get somewhat more skeptical but still basically was in the
                    position of supporting the administration in what it was trying to do.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your feeling about the information that was coming in, through both
                    State and military sources and other places? I mean, were you beginning to view
                    with a certain amount of suspicion?</p>
                <p>LORD: A certain amount. I don't want to say that I was totally disillusioned or
                    that my view changed suddenly or completely. Just that I felt somewhat more
                    discouraged and somewhat more seeing this as a long term problem than I had
                    sitting in Geneva. So I was already edging toward - this is oversimplified - a
                    somewhat more dovish position, but still supporting the administration,
                    certainly hoping we could negotiate our way out of it. The traumatic impact on
                    me came from a telegram from Westmoreland after Tet asking for 150,000 more
                    troops. And that really tipped me. It didn't suddenly make me into Jane Fonda,
                    first of all because I always felt our motives were correct. I always respected
                    critics of the war who thought it was a geopolitical mistake, or even those who
                    felt we should get out in terms of the national interest and in terms of healing
                    of our society. But I never respected those who attacked our leaders as
                    murderers and who felt that our motives were wrong, or who glamorized the
                    Vietcong or the North Vietnamese. That to me was a clear difference among the
                    critics. So I never moved even close to the latter camp, and I continued to
                    believe that we couldn't get out without losing credibility in Asia and around
                    the world, and forfeiting the sacrifices that had already been made in human
                    terms and financial terms. I felt we should stick with it but try to find a
                    reasonable negotiated end.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>However, I do remember a dramatic reaction reading Westmoreland's actual request,
                    the actual cable saying in effect - and I forget whether he was saying we're
                    doing fine, or what he said in front of it - but the fact is he said, I need
                    150,000 more. So this was dramatic at the time. Of course the Vietcong knew that
                    it was military devastation for their side. But the political impact on the
                    United States was tremendous - we thought things were secure, we're making
                    progress, and suddenly everything was up for grabs, including attacks on our own
                    embassy. This really was a dramatic revelation. In those first few days we
                    didn't recognize certainly what a military defeat it had been for the other
                    side. This was almost irrelevant compared to the psychological and political
                    impact on us. And right then I became much more skeptical, frankly close to
                    cynical about how well we were doing, what our prospects were, how much we had
                    hurt the enemy, how soon this thing might end. Because as I said, after all this
                    time and these rather optimistic reports our military is now saying we need
                    150,000 more troops. What's going on here? So this had a tremendous impact on
                    me. I want to hasten to add it didn't suddenly turn me into a unilateral
                    withdrawal person, but it did bring home to me the need to really search if we
                    possibly could for a negotiated solution, and to be much more skeptical of
                    claims by our people in the field.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the press? Were media reports - how were they treated? Let's say
                    before Tet and after Tet. I mean were they treated with skepticism?</p>
                <p>LORD: There are many other observers at the time that could be much more
                    scientific about this. I had the impression that everybody sort of moved in
                    unison, there was a shift as we went along in all quarters. And as each year
                    went by, certainly until Nixon came i- just to take the '67 to '69 period - this
                    was a dramatic period generally in our society. Then after Tet there was much
                    more cynicism and skepticism among the press and therefore there tended to be in
                    both television and print reporting more skepticism. Certainly the body politic
                    felt the same way. Congress was beginning to turn. I'm sure that debates began
                    to heat up within the administration, certainly when Clark Clifford took
                    McNamara's place. He was strongly in favor of a negotiated settlement. McNamara
                    asked for the Pentagon papers to be drawn up. I forget when that request was
                    made, whether it had anything to do with Tet or not. But he asked the Policy
                    Planning Staff, headed by Gelb in this case, the deputy, to put together the
                    Pentagon papers which of course were leaked some years later. But basically the
                    Papers were quite critical about our analysis and conduct of the war, and how we
                    had misled ourselves.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>So, to answer your question, I think the media was shifting, public opinion was
                    shifting, and everyone was having somewhat more doubt. Not everybody
                    unanimously, and there wasn't a seismic shift overnight although Tet had a major
                    immediate impact, but I think everyone was moving in that more skeptical or
                    weary direction. That clearly was brought out by the fact that it became such a
                    volatile issue by '68 that Johnson withdrew from running again for the
                    presidency, that you had anti-war candidates like McCarthy, and I guess Bobby
                    Kennedy and others, cropping up. And you had Clifford taking over from McNamara.
                    You had riots in the street, and 1968 was probably the single worst year that I
                    can remember in American society. The assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin
                    Luther King, the race riots in that year, and the growing controversy on the war
                    and Johnson being called a baby killer and withdrawing from the presidency. It
                    was a very painful period for all of us.</p>
                <p>Q: After the Tet offensive and the request from Westmoreland for 150,000 more
                    troops, did Halperin or somebody walk into your Policy Planning, and say, well,
                    let's take a new look at this, how the hell we're going to get out of here, or
                    something?</p>
                <p>LORD: There's no question that this had an impact on all of us. For someone like
                    myselmy skepticism took a quantum leap. I think for the people like Halperin and
                    Gelb, who were already fairly skeptical, this just reenforced their opinion. So
                    there's no question in my mind throughout this period we were doing papers at
                    least suggesting what might be done on the negotiating front. I'm sure Halperin
                    in particular, and maybe Gelb would weigh in at higher levels verbally on
                    certain matters. And Gelb by this time was fully immersed in the Pentagon
                    papers. So there must have been immediate reaction after this telegram when
                    Halperin in effect said something like you said, or we did it on our own. With
                    his guidance, but self-starting. But I just don't recall the details.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of options were you looking at in Policy
                        Planning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Again, I don't want to have false precision here. I'm sure it would include
                    what you would do militarily as well as what you do on the negotiating front.
                    Because you couldn't really separate them. There were undoubtedly some joint
                    efforts with Systems Analysis so that the combined strengths of the offices
                    could be used to send papers forward. Although Halperin and Gelb had total
                    confidence in me, and relied on me in many ways on Asian policy, they may well
                    have made some suggestions verbally or close held papers that I wasn't aware of.
                    I think if there was any paper work I would have seen it. But I don't recall
                    specific proposals, I'm sure it had to do with trying to get negotiations
                    started in Paris. It probably had to do with possible bombing halts to try to
                    encourage negotiations which of course Johnson did do in '68. So the whole
                    question of how you relate our military pressure, or the temporarily holding
                    back of that pressure versus the possible start of negotiation I'm sure was one
                    of the avenues that was explored.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Q: One is struck by our use of bombing halts, reducing pressure, increasing
                    pressure. About how we thought we could fine tune an approach to an intractable
                    enemy who wasn't paying any attention to any of this. It sounds almost as though
                    we were getting run by academics, who were trying to figure out how to send
                    signals and this same sort of stuff that we got into at other times, at least in
                    theory about nuclear exchanges, how many million people can be killed to make
                    the other side...</p>
                <p>LORD: I wouldn't draw that analogy, but I would agree with you certainly in
                    retrospect. It sounds almost naive to think that you're going to get Hanoi to
                    negotiate by letting up the pressure. In fact, it's just the opposite. They're
                    more apt to negotiate as we found in later stages, if you keep the pressure on.
                    Part of the bombing halts was aimed at domestic public opinion in order to show
                    the American people we're trying to find a peaceful way out, and if in fact the
                    war continued and negotiations didn't start despite our restraint, then it was
                    Hanoi's fault, not our fault. That our President wasn't a war monger, he was
                    trying to be reasonable but he's dealing with unreasonable people who wouldn't
                    even respond to a bombing halt. So I'm sure those in favor of bombing halts had
                    different motives, and some of them may have been a little more sophisticated as
                    you suggested rather than thinking this would necessarily get Hanoi to the
                    negotiating table. They figured it probably wouldn't work but it would shore up
                    domestic support by making the president look reasonable, and would respond to
                    international pressures. And he could say to the French, or to our European
                    allies or to others, I've tried to be reasonable, I've given Hanoi an opening
                    and they won't respond. So on that level you could certainly make a case even in
                    retrospect, but in terms of the psychology in Hanoi there's no question that
                    when you let up pressure on them, they get more unreasonable, and when you
                    increase pressure they are apt to get more reasonable.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in consultation or in synch with the Policy
                        Planning athe Department of State? Or were they even in this mode?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>LORD: We did some work over there. I remember going to some Policy Planning
                    meetings over there on other issues completely. I mean, I talk about working on
                    Asia, but I remember working on a Cuban study in conjunction with the State
                    Department Policy Planning staff, and some other issues which now escape me. But
                    I don't recall continual close collaboration. It was more sporadic depending on
                    the issues involved, and I don't recall their being ever involved in the Vietnam
                    policy debate. I could be wrong on that. I will say that the planning and the
                    activity of the Policy Planning office in ISA on the Vietnam issue really took
                    off when Clifford came in, and Halperin and Gelb and the rest of us saw an
                    opportunity to move the policy. I can't recall all the details, but I do know
                    that Clifford obviously was wanting to move us toward a negotiation. I'm sure
                    that our Policy Planning staff was right in the center of the decisions Johnson
                    made on his efforts in '68 to get negotiations started. There was a speech also
                    where he promised economic aid to Indochina if we had a peaceful settlement. So
                    for moving it in a reasonable and moderate dovish direction, Clifford turned to
                    the Policy Planning staff generally, as well as I'm sure Systems Analysis, to
                    engage in a debate and try to move the President as well as Rusk in a more
                    negotiating dovish position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the ISA, particularly Policy Planning, fairly well
                        integrateinto the Pentagon war machine?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Absolutely. It was a very influential office. ISA consisted of other
                    components, but the policy planning staff was very influential. The Assistant
                    Secretary and ISA as a whole, including Warnke who was there at the time I was
                    there, McNaughton___ having died just before I arrived, was very important with
                    Clifford in particular, but also McNamara before that, on issues in general and
                    Vietnam in particular. So ISA in general and Policy Planning clearly was
                    sufficiently operational on policy, it wasn't just some ivory tower think tank.
                    But we had the luxury of worrying about policy and being devil's advocate, and
                    questioning assumptions because we didn't have to do day-to-day operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Paul Warnke? What was your impression of
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Very favorable, extremely bright. He was a lawyer. Very articulate,
                    courageous, quite dovish but not in an irresponsible way. Very dynamic. I dealt
                    with him quite a bit including working on some speeches that he gave, as well as
                    some speeches that the Secretary gave. I would contribute to some of the
                    drafting of that. I don't want to exaggerate that, they would be modest
                    contributions that many others would massage and expand. So my interaction with
                    him was relatively frequent, usually in the company of Halperin and/or Gelb. I
                    was very favorably impressed with him as someone who could get to the nub of the
                    question very quickly, and he was very articulate, dynamic and courageous.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>Q: Was there an impressionable move on the part of the Pentagon regarding our
                    role in Vietnam during the early years you were there, before Nixon came in?</p>
                <p>LORD: Policy Planning was always the most forward leaning about trying to get
                    negotiations going, being skeptical about the progress of the war, and trying to
                    push a responsible more centrist position, if you will. I would say in the
                    Pentagon it was the most in that direction. The building as a whole under
                    Clifford's leadership shifted in that direction certainly, although there were
                    probably people who still had different views and holdouts but they clearly
                    weren't wrestling with the Secretary for his soul, so to speak. Clifford was
                    looking for help to move in the direction essentially that Policy Planning
                    wanted to go. So the decisive shift came after he came in, and after Tet.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there a feeling after Johnson made his speech in which he said he would
                    not accept the nomination, which came as sort of a shock, this was in the spring
                    of '68 - did that send signals to you all about how things were probably
                    moving?</p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, that gave further encouragement to the responsible doves. These are
                    not people who wanted to pack up and pull out, but they wanted to test the
                    negotiations and they were concerned about domestic opinion, concerned about the
                    lack of progress in Vietnam. So I don't know when Clifford arrived exactly, but
                    certainly Tet and Clifford's arrival and then Johnson's withdrawal all added
                    momentum to looking toward negotiation.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: Not really. I don't recall much interaction with the people who had just
                    come back. There were some colonels in our office, or adjunct officers, who had
                    been out there. But I don't recall sort of an avalanche of cynicism or
                    discouragement or disillusionment, if that's what you're getting at. It didn't
                    have a major impact on me as much as the cable traffic.</p>

                <p>Q: Were these different wars that you were hearing reporting on?</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>LORD: I looked at it with a much more jaundiced eye after Tet than before. I want
                    to emphasize again that by no means was the bulk of my time spent on Vietnam. I
                    did get involved quite a bit but I spent probably more time on Asia in general.
                    In a way Halperin and Gelb were focusing on Vietnam, and I was supposed to sort
                    of look at the context and the other aspects of Asia, including what our policy
                    was going to look like after Vietnam, keyed to various contingencies, etc. So I
                    didn't spend all my time just worrying about Vietnam. However, working in the
                    Pentagon, and being in Washington in the late 1960s it had a tendency to
                    dominate your attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that much of your other activities dealing

                </p>
                <p>LORD: I think there was some of that, military assistance, diplomatic relations,
                    shoring up support from our allies, but also looking ahead as was the province
                    of Policy Planning - what kind of presence, what kind of policies we ought to be
                    pursuing, including beyond Vietnam.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: Honestly, now I just can't recall with that kind of precision. I'm sure my
                    views would have been that this was an area of great interest to America, that
                    we should stay engaged, that how we came out of Vietnam would either make our
                    job easier or harder. I'm quite sure I wrote papers on that ithere was an
                    ambiguous outcome in Vietnam, here are the likely implications and what we ought
                    to be doing. If we clearly prevail here's what is apt to unfold. And if we
                    suffer defeat here's how we do damage limitation and stay engaged as best we
                    can. I think I was doing those kinds of papers.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the things in any government anywhere is the difficulty of writing a
                    paper saying, well, in case we lose this one, this is what we should do. If this
                    gets leaked or something all hell is going to pay and you're tabbed as being
                    defeatist. Did you feel you could write something of that nature?</p>
                <p>LORD: Absolutely. Again I can't recall precisely what I was writing and I'm sure
                    it would be in the context of options or various alternative scenarios, that
                    kind of thing. But Halperin and Gelb were the kind of people who encouraged
                    total free thinking. Like most of my bosses I'm happy to say they would never
                    stand for yes men, wanted to be challenged, wanted people to be unconventional
                    if necessary, be devil's advocate, to think freely. So they would encourage
                    that. So I never felt any inhibitions despite the tensions and the controversy
                    at the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>Q: Did you have the feeling that Policy Planning was getting a little more direct
                    line to Clark Clifford? He was brought on really to bring about a change.</p>
                <p>LORD: That's a perceptive observation. It was always important because it had
                    very high quality people, and it was always the key engine for Warnke and his
                    deputy Townsend Hoopes, etc. And respected by McNamara and Nitze. But there's no
                    question when Clifford came then it was really direct together with Warnke.
                    Warnke was very close to Clifford, in fact they were law partners afterwards. So
                    it would be together with and through Warnke, but the Warnke, Halperin and Gelb
                    influence on Clifford was extraordinary, and I think was probably the key policy
                    influence, certainly on Vietnam. To the extent that policy was turned around in
                    '68 with the bombing halt, the launching of public negotiations, and the
                    emphasis on negotiations, the general scaling down of where we thought we could
                    go, I think all of that was attributable in large measure to the advent of
                    Clifford and the Policy Planning staff reporting to Warnke and Clifford.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your reaction? I mean here you had been dealing with all sorts of
                    things, but again, you couldn't avoid the Vietnam question when Johnson in the
                    spring of '68 said he wasn't going to run again. You had the rather acrimonious
                    primary campaigns which pitted Bobby Kennedy and Gene McCarthy, and Humphrey,
                    no, Humphrey was out of it.</p>
                <p>LORD: They were there running against Johnson. I think Johnson won in New
                    Hampshire but McCarthy was very close. It was close enough so he saw the
                    handwriting coming, and he was just discouraged. So I don't know when Humphrey
                    was actually running in the primaries. Obviously Bobby Kennedy was campaigning
                    when he got killed in California. So there was competition between them. He may
                    well have overtaken Humphrey if he had won California. McCarthy never really had
                    a chance to win but he was a troublesome factor.</p>
                <p>To answer your question, I was very torn at this time as most of us were living
                    in Washington in the late '60s, but on the Vietnam issue I still felt our
                    motives were noble. I still felt that there was domestic support and there were
                    geopolitical reasons not to sell out, or unilaterally withdraw, undercut our
                    friends. But my skepticism had gradually evolved and then took a quantum leap
                    because of Tet. So by the end of '68 as I was about to go to the White House, I
                    really had become much more dovish. Again, not unilateral withdrawal but a real
                    effort to wind this thing down if we possibly could, and to negotiate a
                    settlement if we possibly could.</p>
                <p>Now against that backdrop, however, I had very complicated feelings about the
                    political process. I have great sympathy for LBJ still, felt sad for him, both
                    his visions of the Presidency, and what was happening because of the war. I
                    greatly admired what he had done on the racial issue, and on education and some
                    other matters. I thought he was tremendously able and shared a sense of tragedy
                    that the war had brought him down. Therefore, I had little to no sympathy for
                    the McCarthys, and even the Bobby Kennedys, and certainly the Jane Fondas, or
                    the McGoverns who came along later.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about sort of peace at any price.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's correct. I don't want to lump everybody together here but the Jane
                    Fonda types were certainly different from some of the others. She's a good
                    actress, by the way. But, first I had no sympathy for those who attacked
                    American soldiers. Who said that Johnson was a baby killer. Who glorified the
                    Vietcong or the North Vietnamese, who saw this as a strictly civil war, who
                    didn't recognize the invasion by North Vietnam, not only in South Vietnam but
                    Laos and Cambodia. Who didn't recognize any of the geopolitical dimensions. And
                    basically who saw this as black and white with the good guys being the Vietcong
                    and Hanoi, and all the bad guys being American. So that whole crowd stirred my
                    resentment. I'm not lumping all the candidates in that corner, I want to make
                    that clear, but that extreme and the protests along those lines, and the burning
                    of the American flag, and the insulting of the president, etc., I had no
                    sympathy for even though I had become more skeptical and more dovish.</p>
                <p>I respected those who felt we should cut our losses, get out. Who felt that our
                    objective was desirable perhaps, but that we just didn't have the wherewithal to
                    pull it off, and then what it was doing to us as a society, and what it was
                    doing to us in terms of our responsibilities around the world, and the impact on
                    our efforts and reputation around the world was too expensive and that therefore
                    we should make a real effort to get out. I respected those who said we ought to
                    make some concessions in the negotiations, etc. I would disagree with those who
                    would go too far, in my view, in terms of undercutting our credibility as a
                    world power, and bugging out too quickly. But as long as they didn't attack our
                    motives, and didn't call us the bad guys, I could see, given a tremendous cost
                    in human lives, given the skepticism I increasingly acquired, given the
                    tremendous financial costs, and the other costs, why reasonable people could
                    certainly disagree. So I always felt, let's have a vivid debate on policy, but
                    let's not have a debate on motives or morality. Nobody has a monopoly on wisdom
                    or morality. So therefore I was more sympathetic to Johnson than to McCarthy or
                    Bobby Kennedy. And basically I respected Hubert Humphrey from what I knew about
                    him. However, as Nixon came along I felt that he was a good alternative. I
                    thought he had matured since the '60 campaign. I remember I had some difficulty
                    making up my mind who to vote for. It gives you a sense of my conflictive nature
                    at the time. To the extent I was for Humphrey, it would be that I thought that
                    he would be about where I was on the Vietnam question, and that he was a very
                    decent, honorable man, a little bit too liberal on domestic issues for my taste
                    although he had my full sympathy on the racial issues. To the extent I would be
                    for Nixon it would be that maybe a new party, a new administration could make a
                    clean sweep of this thing in a sense of a new approach, that Nixon had
                    tremendous foreign policy experience, and that therefore he would be
                    helpful.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>I was torn. One day I'd be fighting at a cocktail party or at a dinner with
                    somebody who was attacking American morality, and painting the Vietcong as
                    heroes. And the next day I'd be telling the hawks they're crazy. I mean if we're
                    doing so well why does Westmoreland need another 150,000 troops, and we've got
                    to somehow find a way to get this thing over with. So I was in the middle, and
                    it was a very painful time for all of us, and you throw in race riots and
                    assassinations, it was the single worst year that I can recall.</p>
                <p>Q: When the election of Nixon came about, I assume that the Pentagon saw this...I
                    mean most of the people who were involved, the military side of it, viewed this
                    with a certain amount of relief.</p>
                <p>LORD: I don't recall there was any opinion across the board. I guess in principle
                    the military thought Nixon being a staunch anti-communist would be firm. But you
                    have to remember that Nixon was promising a secret plan to end the Vietnam war.
                    So on the one hand he had hard and tough anti-communist credentials, but on the
                    other hand he was taking advantage of weariness with the war and suggesting he
                    had ways he was going to end it. He never had a secret plan. To the extent he
                    had a plan, it was basically figuring he could use the Russians and maybe the
                    Chinese to pressure Hanoi, to bring the war to an end by trying to improve
                    relations with them, and cornering Vietnam in that way. But he didn't have any
                    secret plan. Moreover the military wasn't all hard-line because some of them
                    were dovish or at least disillusioned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...when does one get the hell out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: In my own office, interestingly enough, although Halperin and Gelb were
                    Democrats and relatively liberal, although both hard headed geopoliticians as
                    well, Gelb had actually worked with Senator Javits who was a liberal Republican,
                    and Halperin had worked with Kissinger at Harvard. So the victory of Nixon
                    probably was - you'd have to ask them and others in my immediate entourage -
                    greeted with ambivalence I would imagine.</p>
                <p>Q: After the election, before Nixon came in and even shortly thereafter, I would
                    have thought you would have been back in your early GATT mode waiting for a new
                    group to come in.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>LORD: Well, here's what happened. It was obviously the serenity and slowness of
                    Geneva and this had no relationship to the controversy and pace and emotions of
                    Washington, so I didn't have any danger of getting into the GATT mode. The first
                    person, I believe, that Kissinger turned to after he was chosen by the President
                    to be National Security Advisor, was Mort Halperin. This was certainly as early
                    as December 1968, I believe it was probably November 1968. It would have been
                    within days when Nixon to everyone's surprise chose Kissinger, having only met
                    him once casually at a party, I believe, certainly not knowing him very well.
                    And Nixon deserves great credit for choosing Kissinger. After all here was Nixon
                    from California, conservative, anti-communist Republican from the grassroots of
                    America, coming in with the Haldemans and the Ehrlichmans, the California crowd.
                    Distrustful and disdainful of the elite, the establishment, the northeast Ivy
                    League, and frankly with a heavy dose of anti-Semitism. And who does he pick as
                    his National Security Advisor but Henry Kissinger, a Jewish immigrant from
                    Harvard who had worked as a close advisor to Nelson Rockefeller, Nixon's
                    strongest opponent. So it was an amazing choice, and a brilliant one.</p>
                <p>Anyway, as soon as Kissinger was chosen he asked Halperin to join his staff.
                    Halperin immediately accepted. He also asked Halperin to start devising an NSC
                    system so that he, Kissinger, on behalf of the President could control American
                    foreign policy out of the White House. Halperin was a genius at this.</p>
                <p>To get back to my situation, Halperin therefore decided early to go over to the
                    White House from the Pentagon. These were civil service appointments but at the
                    pleasure of the Secretary of Defense obviously. And Gelb was therefore going to
                    be acting head of Policy Planning, it wasn't clear how long he would stay on. He
                    was willing to stay on if the next Secretary of Defense wished him to. As for
                    Halperin, the first person he asked to join him with Henry Kissinger was me.
                    Gelb came to me and asked me to stay with him at the Pentagon. So I had to make
                    a choice. I respected both and I didn't know Kissinger, I had hardly even heard
                    of him frankly, and I had never met the man. So I took a hard look and as always
                    consulted with my wife. I don't remember it as an agonizing choice although I
                    was closer to Gelb as a friend, and greatly respected him. But I think it was
                    pretty clear to me - the opportunity to work in the White House as a general
                    proposition in one's career at the NSC, and with someone as bright as Halperin
                    and what I had heard about Kissinger and his brilliance, and frankly the first
                    inklings that Nixon was going to run foreign policy out of the White House. For
                    all these reasons it was a relatively easy choice, although it was a little
                    painful to leave Gelb. He was very understanding. He wanted me to stay because
                    he saw me as one of the more able people in the office but he understood. So I
                    decided to go with Halperin. I actually went over, however, in February 1969,
                    but not before I was interviewed by Kissinger. At the Pentagon, I was given an
                    Outstanding Performance Award.</p>

                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Q: I think it particularly important for the historian to capture sort of the
                    birth pangs of anything. The Kissinger time and the NSC, this is a real earth
                    change in foreign policy at that time, of the system. You know, you're the new
                    boy on the block, you'd never met the man, can you talk about your interview
                    with him and then about the staffing.</p>
                <p>LORD: First, once I told Halperin I would go with him to the White House, then
                    he, of course, recommended me to Kissinger. Kissinger insisted, as he should and
                    I think with everyone else, on interviewing each of his staff. At that point it
                    was only about 30 people on the substantive side, maybe it was less than that as
                    he came in. So I went over there, it was probably February of 1969, it might
                    have been late January, to be interviewed by Kissinger and I'll never forget the
                    total chaos I saw. He was sitting in the West Basement of the White House. This
                    is before he had his office upstairs. He was about to go see the Secretary of
                    the Treasury, Connally. It was still very early and it was sort of his first
                    courtesy call on the Secretary of the Treasury, so he was impatient. He was
                    running late, I had to wait, and the usual tension and dynamism, and urgency and
                    chaos of the Kissinger front office was well in evidence.</p>
                <p>He finally came, I went into his office. We had about a 15 minute conversation.
                    He basically, as I recall, indicated that obviously Halperin was very high on me
                    and that was very important to him but he always wanted to check people out. And
                    the dominant questioning I recall was on loyalty. Not in a cynical way, not in a
                    preview of wire-tapping, but it was basically, if you're working for the
                    President of the United States, there will be times when you will disagree with
                    his policy. In effect, I'm sure he said, you have every right, and I want you to
                    argue your point of view, but recall that you're serving this President and you
                    have to be loyal to him and be comfortable with it. Again, I'm reconstructing
                    now, but I must have said in effect, I certainly want to put forth my point of
                    view and argue my case. I'm in general agreement with what I know of the
                    President's policies, and of course I will be loyal in the sense that if I lose
                    an argument I'll carry out the policy. I don't think we got to this point in the
                    conversation, but certainly my own view would have, been, even if I didn't
                    articulate it, that if I get to a point that a policy is fundamental to me in
                    moral and/or geopolitical terms and I think it is wrong, then of course I'll
                    leave rather than being disloyal. And I've always felt very strongly that that
                    ought to be one's approach.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>Your obligation is to argue your point of view on policy issues and do it as
                    vigorously as possible, even at the risk of being a pain in the neck, being a
                    nag, and irritating your superiors. That is your obligation. You should do it
                    intelligently, and not hysterically, but you have to put your point of view. On
                    the other hand, you've got every obligation if you lose the argument, to
                    faithfully carry it out on the understanding that generally you're going to be
                    comfortable with policy lines. There may be some individual battles you lose.
                    However, if you reach a point where a policy is so fundamental to you, and of
                    course Vietnam could certainly be that in terms of our moral, geopolitical and
                    emotional investment, then if you lose a battle, and you're really uncomfortable
                    with implementation, your obligation is to leave. You can choose whether to do
                    it quietly, or to try to make a splash. But what you cannot do is subvert that
                    policy by leaking to the press, or going around bad mouthing the President or
                    the policy.</p>
                <p>So this was my approach and it's important as we get to later events because I
                    felt very strongly. It's my strong conviction, and I knew it was an emotional
                    time, that you press your case, fight for your point of view, but faithfully
                    carry out policy if you lose, and leave before leaking.</p>
                <p>Now I don't know how I articulated all this to Kissinger at the time, but that
                    would have been the general posture I would have conveyed, and it was clearly
                    what he was looking for. But people have to remember, we'll get into Kissinger
                    later. The thing about Kissinger that people don't always understand is that the
                    last thing he wanted was yes men. Very few people survived him as long as I did,
                    Eagleburger and Sonnenfeldt and a few others, and these were people who would
                    talk back to him, and whom he respected. As long as you mounted an
                    intellectually respectable argument. What he didn't like was people who rolled
                    over. He could intimidate you with his intellectual prowess, so people often,
                    because of his temper, or because of the strength of his mind, would recoil or
                    would not engage him. These people he didn't respect. For a variety of reasons
                    we'll get into, a good many of his staff resigned and left and the people who
                    stayed on were those who could put up with him, and who would argue back. So it
                    was about a 15 minute rather rushed conversation in which essentially he wanted
                    to establish my loyalty. Then he left and I was immediately hired and I went
                    over there by February of 1969.</p>
                <p>Q: I was wondering, you talked about leaks, but was this part of the working
                    atmosphere when you were in Policy Planning over at the Pentagon?</p>
                <p>LORD: Not really that I recall. This became a major issue in the Nixon White
                    House as I needn't add. I don't recall this being a problem in the Pentagon,
                    certainly nothing that really touched me, or anybody in our office. I just don't
                    recall that being a problem. Now, maybe I've got a faulty memory, but I just
                    don't remember that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the Pentagon that wouldn't have been particularly part
                        of thmodus operandi.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>LORD: I want to make clear, I don't think Kissinger specifically said I don't
                    want you leaking, or I don't want you betraying the President. I would have been
                    insulted if he came at me in an obnoxious way. So it was a respectable
                    presentation, in which in effect he said, this is an emotional time, we're going
                    to have some tough issues, it's going to be hard work. I want your point of
                    view, but I also want a sense that you feel you can carry out policies for this
                    President whom you are serving even if you disagree with him. So that was the
                    thrust. I didn't take it in any negative way. I thought it was a legitimate
                    inquiry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the staff that you were meeting there and the
                        people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: One of the attractions of going there was, it was clear, as I said, that
                    Kissinger's reputation, Nixon's experience in foreign policy and clearly wanting
                    to run foreign policy from the White House, and the quality of the staff being
                    assembled, all this meant that the NSC was where the action was going to be. I
                    have been fortunate in my career that I've generally been where the action is.
                    Certainly Policy Planning in ISA in the late '60s was one of the two or three
                    key areas of U.S. government in foreign policy at that time. Certainly the Nixon
                    White House was the central area of foreign policy when I was there in the early
                    '70s. Then the State Department, under Kissinger, when I was head of Policy
                    Planning, clearly was where the action was in the mid-1970s. So, in this early
                    part of my career I was where the action was, and that was obviously important
                    to me.</p>
                <p>This was quite possibly the most brilliant staff ever assembled in foreign policy
                    in the post-War era. Now, people will disagree with that. I'm sure George
                    Kennan, and his very small first State Department Policy Planning staff was very
                    impressive. I happen to think my own Policy Planning staff which we'll get into
                    later, was clearly quite extraordinary too. It's the only one that I would put
                    up against the Nixon-Kissinger White House. Certainly the staff I had just come
                    from, Policy Planning in ISA, was a very able staff. So I've been fortunate to
                    bwith some very able people, and dynamic and ambitious people, and where the
                    action was.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>As for the staff, I can't reconstruct every name, but they included people like
                    the following. Al Haig, the military assistant who would eventually would become
                    NSC deputy, who went on to become head of NATO and Vice Chairman of the Army and
                    also chief of staff to Nixon and the one who helped ease him out and make the
                    transition during Watergate, and later Secretary of State, and Presidential
                    candidate. You had Mort Halperin directing the NSC interagency system and policy
                    planner who I have already mentioned, one of the brightest people in government,
                    probably the youngest Deputy Assistant Secretary in the history of the Pentagon.
                    Hal Sonnenfeldt on Soviet, European and arms control issues, who already had a
                    reputation, knew Kissinger at Harvard, had a complicated relationship because
                    they were both Jewish immigrants from Germany and although Sonnenfeldt never had
                    the visibility or stature of Kissinger, he was very bright, very tough in
                    talking back to Kissinger. They had a very complicated, mutually respectful, but
                    also mutually prickly relationship. Bill Hyland, who was also a Soviet and
                    European expert like Sonnenfeldt, who went on to be director of Intelligence and
                    Research in the State Department, and editor of Foreign Affairs among other
                    areas. Dick Sneider on Asian policy who was eventually ambassador to Korea, and
                    a very able Foreign Service officer. Also, John Holdridge, on China and Asia,
                    who became our ambassador and Assistant Secretary. Tony Lake who was special
                    assistant to Kissinger in 1969 when I was sitting across the way in the
                    Executive Building with Halperin, a bright Foreign Service officer who had been
                    in Vietnam, went on to be head of the State Department Policy Planning staff and
                    National Security Advisor. Roger Morris, another special assistant, an extremely
                    bright, young person who went on to be a major historian and writer. William
                    Watts, who also was a bright young officer. Jonathan Howe, only a naval
                    commander then, went on to be a four-star admiral and actually headed our
                    ill-fated operation in Somalia, and also was head of Political-Military Affairs
                    in the State Department. John Negroponte, who worked with me on Indochina one of
                    our outstanding Foreign Service officers, went on to become ambassador in
                    several places. He wasn't there at the very beginning. Fred Bergsten, who has
                    gone on to be one of the top economists in this country, Assistant Secretary of
                    the Treasury and now head of the International Institute of Economics, Robert
                    Hormats, who went on to become an Under Secretary as well as Vice Chairman of
                    Goldman Sachs. Pete Vaky, another outstanding Foreign Service officers in charge
                    of Latin American affairs. Peter Rodman, a close, personal assistant to
                    Kissinger who went on to be head of State Policy Planning as well as a senior
                    person in NSC staff. Hal Saunders who went on to be a top person on the Middle
                    East, both the NSC and at the State Department. Others who came from Systems
                    Analysis at the Pentagon were outstanding, such as Larry Lynn, Jan Lodal, and
                    Phil O'Deen who worked on arms control and Vietnam.</p>
                <p>In addition, Larry Eagleburger was there briefly in the front office and went on
                    to become Under Secretary of State, ambassador, Deputy Secretary of State, and
                    Secretary. Also, Brent Scowcroft, who served as NSC advisor to Ford and Bush. So
                    what you had was a combination of some of the best Foreign Service officers
                    drawn from State, some of your brightest academics from Harvard and elsewhere.
                    Some key people already in the government besides the State Department, like the
                    Defense Department, or the CIA and top military people.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>The list goes on and on: Robert Gates (became Director of CIA), John Lehman
                    (Secretary of the Navy), Robert Oakley (ambassador), Walt Slocombe (Under
                    Secretary), Stepen Hadley (Deputy NSC Advisor), Bud McFarlane (National Security
                    Advisor), and Andrew Marshall (Pentagon guru). Some of these served when I was
                    at State, 1973-'77.</p>
                <p>What was also generally true, if you could generalize here, is that on the whole
                    this was a fairly liberal crowd. Certainly from the standpoint of Haldeman,
                    Ehrlichman and Nixon. And there was always some suspicion and tension between
                    the conservatives, the Californians, and the domestic political types, versus
                    the academics, Jewish intellectualls, the elite, always suspect to Nixon. But to
                    Kissinger's credit, he didn't worry about reputation, just tried to get the best
                    people. He wanted them to be loyal within general parameters, but aside from
                    that he didn't care about their ideology, he just wanted the best minds. And he
                    got them. He also got some of the most skillful and dynamic bureaucratic tigers
                    knowing how to operate the system. Nixon wanted to run foreign policy out of the
                    White House. That's why he chose Kissinger. That's why he chose Bill Rogers to
                    be Secretary of State, a close friend of Nixon's, but low key, little experience
                    in foreign policy, a lawyer. His job was to be loyal to Nixon, keep the State
                    Department running, handle secondary issues, keep things quiet, not cause any
                    problems while Nixon, Kissinger and the NSC staff ran foreign policy.</p>
                <p>This was particularly the case for the three priority issues as Nixon came into
                    office from his standpoint, and Kissinger's standpoint - ending the Vietnam War
                    on an honorable basis; opening up to China; and improving relations with Russia.
                    In effect, taking care in his first term of the communist world, as well as the
                    inherited war, clearing the decks so that in his second term he could build a
                    structure of peace, if you will, on the momentum of the first term, and shore up
                    other alliance relationships, although he worked on that in his first term as
                    well, work on the Middle East, and attack some of the new issues including the
                    developing world. That was the master plan. He was poised to do it, of course,
                    after his landslide victory in 1972 and then along came Watergate. So that's the
                    general staff. I could get into the system if you'd like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we talk about the system.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>LORD: I've already given the priorities, obviously Vietnam was a priority, plus
                    China and Russia, and in all three of those there was a heavy dose of secrecy
                    and clearly running it out of the White House. So from the very beginning you
                    had control out of the White House, and that was accomplished in several ways.
                    First, Nixon himself had tremendous strategic conceptual strength, a lot of
                    experience as Vice President and since he was defeated in 1960 he had traveled
                    around the world and met a lot of foreign leaders, gained a lot of capital and
                    brownie points and respect around the world by his travels. He did a lot of
                    reading and thinking and writing including his Foreign Affairs article on Asia
                    which gave the suggestion that he might open up to China. So you had that
                    strength coming from the President himself and his grasp of policy.</p>
                <p>Then you had Kissinger with his brilliant approach and we'll get into him later
                    but even though he had spent his life in academia he immediately had an instinct
                    for the juggling and bureaucratic infighting, a good sense of what to do in a
                    bureaucracy, as well as later on with the press and the Congress. Then you had
                    underneath them this brilliant staff. Then you had Kissinger willing to work
                    really hard as well as being brilliant and tough, and frankly Rogers not working
                    that hard. Then you had Nixon insisting that Kissinger be in charge, and of
                    course Kissinger not at all resisting.</p>
                <p>As a result you had the makings of White House dominance. This was then cemented
                    even before the inauguration. This is all in Kissinger's memoirs and other good
                    works including Walter Isaacson's study of Kissinger. Kissinger asked Halperin,
                    before the inauguration, to devise a NSC system, how do you run a foreign
                    policy, with the White House in charge. He worked with General Goodpaster, who
                    was in effect Eisenhower's NSC advisor.</p>
                <p>As you look back, a quick segment here, different presidents have approached
                    foreign policy in different ways bureaucratically. It depends on their style,
                    their relative interest in foreign policy, their relative experience in it, the
                    relative priority they give it versus domestic policy. So oversimplified, you
                    have a couple of systems. One system is where the President, although in
                    ultimate charge, essentially delegates day-to-day responsibility to foreign
                    policy to his Secretary of State. And that pattern was certainly Eisenhower
                    delegating to Dulles. This is not to denigrate Eisenhower's key decisions, and
                    he was terrific on foreign policy. And this is not to say which system is
                    better, it's just a different style. So he was an Army staff man, and he
                    basically felt he would make the key decisions, but he did delegate and he
                    trusted Dulles. He also had an elaborate NSC system, the forerunner essentially
                    of the NSC with a lot of staff papers and bringing up to him single
                    recommendations agreed upon as much as possible before it got to him. That was
                    his style.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>Also, in this general mode I would say Truman and Marshall to a certain extent,
                    and Acheson, although Truman obviously was heavily involved in foreign policy as
                    well. But again, he let Acheson and Marshall have a lot of the lead. This was
                    also certainly true of Ford delegating to Kissinger when he was Secretary of
                    State. The same was true of Reagan delegating to Shultz, with less powerful NSC
                    advisors.</p>
                <p>Now you have the other extreme where the President wants to dominate foreign
                    policy. Nixon is the clearest example of that. And there are others where there
                    is a balance where you had strong NSC advisors, but you also had fairly strong
                    Secretaries of State, and therefore there's more equal balance. And there are
                    several examples of that. With Kennedy, you had Bundy and Rostow, but Rusk was
                    no shrinking violet. And you also, of course, had McNamara. With Johnson you had
                    Rostow in the White House and you still had Rusk. So these presidents were more
                    heavily involved than say, Eisenhower and Ford, but not dominate as Nixon and
                    his National Security Advisor. Certainly with Carter you had pulling and tugging
                    between Brzezinski and Vance; but as time went on the White House dominated
                    more, but not because Carter had great experience in foreign policy. With Bush,
                    you had Baker very important but also Bush heavily involved in foreign policy
                    with Scowcroft, and even criticized for spending too much time on that and not
                    on domestic policies. Clinton basically early on focused on domestic policy with
                    Christopher and Lake fairly balanced. The same is true of Albright and
                    Berger.</p>
                <p>But to step back for a minute, on the whole you often have presidents with strong
                    NSC advisors who want to run foreign policy, and spend a lot of time on it, and
                    Secretaries of State that are more caretakers. Or you have Presidents with a
                    National Security Advisor who is more of a technician coordinating the agencies,
                    and the Secretary of State is in the lead.</p>
                <p>So against this backdrop and coming before some of the examples I've given, Nixon
                    clearly was the most decisive running policy out of the White House. Kissinger
                    knew this, turned to Halperin and said devise a NSC system. Halperin was the key
                    guy. He worked with some others including Goodpaster to devise a system before
                    inauguration day so it would be launched immediately. It basically set up a
                    series of committees all of whom, the key ones, were chaired by the National
                    Security Advisor. And, of course, in the government if you chair a committee,
                    you generally have the power. I won't go into elaborate detail now. There were
                    one or two committees that were chaired by State, but the key ones on crisis
                    action, or on arms control, or the higher groups in general were chaired by the
                    National Security Advisor, or at lower levels by his deputies with State,
                    Defense, CIA and, as appropriate, economic agencies represented, but the NSC in
                    the chair.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>This system was set up with two series of memoranda type operations. One called
                    National Security Study Memorandum, NSSMs, which would be signed by the
                    Assistant to the President, Kissinger, and ask agencies to prepare studies and
                    options. Then you had NSSDs, National Security Study Directives, which were
                    decisions by the President, signed by him or Kissinger. So this elaborate series
                    of committees was set up; the details can be found in Kissinger's other books.
                    But the main point was the NSC advisor or his deputies would chair.</p>
                <p>Now the other part of this system was that this President, unlike e.g.
                    Eisenhower, wanted options. So he would ask for options which in effect would
                    say, here's our objective, here's two-three-four-five ways you can go about it.
                    Here are the pros and cons and the assumptions of each of these approaches. And
                    here's how the agencies choose in terms of the options. Nixon liked to know
                    different points of view. He wasn't against consensus, but he didn't want to
                    fudge real disagreements by making people come up with a consensus when they
                    should show up in the intellectual debate.</p>
                <p>We used to joke because of this, since we always had to have options, that we
                    would normally prepare a paper for the President, with three options. Option one
                    would be go to nuclear war. Option two would be, surrender unconditionally. And
                    option three would be, continue current policy. But on the whole the
                    intellectual content of these papers that were turned out, was very high.</p>
                <p>Within hours, I believe, of the inauguration of Nixon, Kissinger started issuing
                    the first of these papers. The very first set up the NSC system as I've
                    suggested. There was consultation with Rogers but he was somewhat naive
                    bureaucratically, and with both the pace of events and Kissinger's skill, he
                    didn't realize how much power he was giving away. So within a day or two the
                    system was set up that was going to put Kissinger in charge.</p>
                <p>Q: It sounds like this was a reflection on Al Haig when he became Secretary of
                    State. He issued a directive really having learned his lesson, gratefully
                    accepting all power to him.</p>
                <p>LORD: You're absolutely right. He directly remembered this Kissinger movement
                    right at the outset of the Nixon's administration and tried the same in the
                    Reagan administration. But he came up against Jim Baker and others, Ed Meese I
                    guess, whereas Kissinger was up against Rogers. Haig overreached and he was made
                    to back off immediately. So he moved too quickly and too boldly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He never really recovered.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: He never really recovered from it. But you're absolutely right, it came
                    directly out of this experience. Al Haig was not that important at this point in
                    1969 in a transition period. It was really Halperin and probably Sonnenfeldt was
                    involved as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>Just to review a bit here. You have a strong President, experienced and
                    conceptually strong on foreign policy. A strong NSC advisor, and
                    bureaucratically it turned out, not just in conceptual terms, a very hard
                    worker. A brilliant staff. And then a system that locked in the supremacy of the
                    NSC. The other thing that was done in the first days in addition to issuing the
                    decision memorandum setting up the system was the issuing a flood of study
                    memorandums asking the bureaucracy to study all the major issues in front of it,
                    certainly Vietnam but also arms control, and Europe, and I'm sure the developing
                    countries and foreign aid, and CIA, whatever it was. It was a genuine effort to
                    say, look, we're a new Administration, let's review the bidding intellectually,
                    to set our strategy for the next four years, and let's do this systematically
                    and give everyone a chance to weigh in. And I think that was a genuine motive
                    here. There was another motive, however, and that was to keep everybody so busy
                    in the State Department, Defense Department, and elsewhere, that Kissinger and
                    his staff could immediately get on with Vietnam, China, Russia, etc, while
                    everyone was buried in this paper flow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One usually hears the motive was just the second one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I talked to Kissinger, and for some reason we got on this subject just a
                    couple of weeks ago. And he said that's the conventional interpretation, and I
                    admit there's an element of truth there. But he emphasized - and he is right -
                    that we were looking for intellectual answers. We did exhaustive studies on
                    Vietnam, for example. Every kind of analysis on how things were going, various
                    options. Ironically, one of the people brought in as a consultant was Dan
                    Ellsberg. He helped to prepare the questions on Indochina for the agencies. We
                    worked closely together. I was in charge of collating, summarizing all the
                    responses and drafting memos to Kissinger and, I believe, the President. I
                    probably did this on other issues, or at least worked with the staff
                    specialists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk about leaks, Ellsbey made the leak of all leaks</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's correct. So this was a very dynamic, exciting productive time where
                    a very lot of good work was done intellectually, even as Kissinger was grabbing
                    the system, a lot of good intellectual work done on what we ought to be doing in
                    the next few years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're going to go to the issues next time around, but when
                        yocame on board were you told what area you were going to be doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes. Let me explain what my job was. I wore two hats essentially. I was
                    working for Halperin. We were sitting in the Executive Office Building, not the
                    West Wing of the White House. The West Wing on the bottom floor was where
                    Kissinger was before he moved upstairs to where the National Security Advisor
                    has always been since. The basement had room only for him and whoever was going
                    to be his deputy, and his special assistant and his secretaries. At that point
                    he had two special assistants, Tony Lake and Roger Morris. He didn't have a
                    deputy at that point, and all these bureaucratic jungle fighters on the staff
                    were beginning to aim to be deputy, particularly Halperin, Sonnenfeldt, and
                    Lynn. Al Haig aced them all out, and ended up being the deputy, because
                    Kissinger felt as a military man he would be loyal, and he thought very well of
                    Haig who had done some tough things for him already. This was well into the
                    first year. So it was an amazing performance by Haig who was a rather obscure
                    colonel, to beat out some of the bureaucratic and brilliant giants, to end up
                    being the deputy, partly because Kissinger saw him as less threatening, which is
                    rather ironic given their relationship later. He saw with more concern someone
                    like a Halperin or a Sonnenfeldt hanging around him.</p>
                <p>So most of the staff was over in the Executive Office Building, and that's where
                    I was and Halperin was. Our basic function was to run the NSC system, namely all
                    the issues. The paper work of the system, as well as some of the substance
                    working with the key experts.</p>
                <p>Our job was not any particular region, but to run the NSC system which meant we
                    were in charge of the paper work, getting ready for these meetings, whether it
                    was subcommittees, whether it was Kissinger's level, or whether it was the
                    National Security Council itself with the President. So it was a fascinating
                    place to be. We would be responsible, working with the experts depending on
                    issues, for putting papers in front of Kissinger or the President collecting the
                    views of the various agencies that had come in, setting forth the agenda and his
                    talking points and what he wanted to get out of each meeting. Whether it was a
                    crisis meeting of the WSAG, or whether it was a verification panel meeting on
                    arms control, whether it was just a regular regional issue. We would be
                    responsible for making sure that the agencies knew about the agenda, that their
                    views got in and were presented to Kissinger, or one of his deputies running the
                    meeting, and that his objectives for the meeting and his talking points on the
                    agenda were in front of him. And then Halperin would go to these meetings, or I
                    would go to the meetings, or we'd both go, and we would be responsible again
                    working with the relevant experts to prepare decision memorandums if a decision
                    had been made, to be issued by the NSC advisor, or in rare cases by the
                    President himself to the bureaucracy. Or to prepare a memo to the President
                    summarizing the result; maybe there was a consensus and no meeting would be
                    necessary. Or we would begin to work again with the experts to prepare the
                    options paper and the agenda for the President's meeting along the lines we'd
                    done for Kissinger. This, of course, was fascinating stuff and a lot of hard
                    work. So the running of the NSC system and the paper work was one thing that
                    Halperin and I were responsible for.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>The other hat I wore, with Halperin was to be mini Policy Planning Staff, and to
                    the extent we had time and initiative, to play devil's advocate, challenging
                    assumptions, giving policy alternatives, looking ahead - the type papers that
                    you get out of Policy Planning whether it's at State, Defense, or the White
                    House. So Kissinger looked to Halperin and me, particularly Halperin, he didn't
                    know me that well, to write some of these papers which we did. I wrote some and
                    to Halperin's credit, it wouldn't be just his taking over my name. He would make
                    clear to Kissinger that I had written the memo, either it would be from me to
                    Halperin, or Halperin would say, here's an attached paper by Lord. I don't think
                    I ever directly sent a memo; either it would certainly be unvarnished or
                    Halperin would edit or we would draft it together for his signature. I wrote
                    several. Often critical of our policy, and this again was why I admired
                    Kissinger because as long as it was well argued he didn't get mad. He might
                    stomp around and challenge you and attack you, etc., but he welcomed this.</p>
                <p>I distinctly remember writing a memo on Laos. It was very critical on what we
                    were doing, I don't remember the details; others on Vietnam, at least some
                    adjustments in our policy. I even wrote one on African policy and tried to make
                    the case, somewhat naively with Kissinger frankly, that in addition to
                    geopolitical reasons we should do some shifting of our policy towards South
                    Africa, we owed it to our domestic audience.</p>
                <p>Some of the papers I wrote, plus the work I did on this NSC system with Halperin,
                    caught his attention. So when Tony Lake indicated he wanted to leave the job as
                    special assistant in February 1970, Kissinger asked me to come over. That was a
                    year later. But that's what I did the first year and it was pretty exhausting
                    although not as exhausting as when I became special assistant.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we go the next time into the issues that came up, were the meetings for
                    decision-making getting people together, with either Kissinger or his deputy, or
                    somebody sitting there? I've been to so many meetings when people get together
                    and things don't really happen.</p>
                <p>LORD: There were plenty of times, particularly early on, where you were just
                    reviewing things and not necessarily trying to come up with a conclusion. Maybe
                    saying, okay, we've brought the issue this far now let's go back and do some
                    more work on it. There were other times where you'd have disagreement and we
                    need more work, bounce it back and come back again. Other times where you would
                    have enough to go forward to the President. Other times where decisions were
                    made. Sometimes there were crisis meetings to react, e.g. to the downing of an
                    American plane by North Korea, or a quick meeting when there was a border clash
                    between the Chinese and the Russians in the summer of 1969, a very important
                    event which really brought home to Kissinger and Nixon why the opening to China
                    would make sense. So there were different kinds of meetings; we didn't always
                    have decisions.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>The other thing I should point out is the advantage Kissinger had in his control
                    of the system, in addition to brilliance, hard work, staff and the process set
                    up, was proximity. This is always an advantage a National Security Advisor has
                    over a Secretary of State, not that Nixon's door was always open but Kissinger
                    could get in there although Haldeman tried to control him a little bit. He could
                    pick up the phone and go in and see Nixon on a daily basis; he briefed him every
                    morning. This is crucial before NSC meetings. In addition to the papers with the
                    options and maybe tabs with the actual details, with State, Defense, and other
                    agency positions. Kissinger always had the opportunity, and generally took
                    advantage of it - and Halperin or I, or the expert on the staff did it - to put
                    his own views on top. In fairness he would make sure the President knew other
                    peoples' views. He had to, otherwise even he would be in trouble. He owed it to
                    the President and he owed it for his own protection so it didn't look like he
                    was cutting people off. But he would get the last word in, either verbally
                    before a meeting, or in his covering memo saying, well look, Secretary Rogers
                    thinks you ought to do this. Secretary Laird thinks you ought to do that. Here's
                    why I think you ought to go this direction for the following reasons. He would
                    even say on paper or verbally, here's how you ought to play it at the
                    meeting.</p>
                <p>Now I want to make clear Nixon in the NSC meetings generally did not make
                    decisions in the meetings. I don't think he ever did. He basically would listen,
                    give people a chance to present their points of views. It was usually led off by
                    a CIA briefing and an overview of issues and options by Kissinger. Nixon would
                    let everyone weigh in, and then go back and weigh his decision. And, again,
                    Kissinger would have a crack at him after the meeting. Whether it's right after
                    or the next couple of days, he could go in there. So he had tremendous access
                    and influence.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, another strength Nixon and Kissinger had for foreign policy, and for
                    the system being dominated by the White House, was the fact that they thought in
                    generally similar terms. They both believed in strategic approaches, not just
                    tactical day-to-day approaches. They both had a conceptual framework they were
                    working in, they were both hard headed geopoliticals who clearly put an emphasis
                    on what countries did in their foreign policies, not their domestic policies,
                    who were clearly attracted to balance of power. And they usually shared views on
                    specific issues. Each independently, for example, saw the imperative of opening
                    up with China. They both deserve credit.</p>
                <p>Finally, there was a shared strength because Nixon and Kissinger had a good
                    division of labor. Nixon as President had to make the tough decisions. He had a
                    strategic framework. He was knowledgeable, but he didn't get mired down in
                    details. So he was a general strategist, and he kept informed and on top of
                    things.</p>
                <p>He generally left to Kissinger the actual negotiations, the tactics, a lot of the
                    backgrounding of the press, the promotion of public perceptions, the
                    bureaucratic chairing of committees, the infighting, and the traveling.</p>

                <p>So I think that President Nixon of all of the presidents that I worked for struck
                    the best balance between not getting into too much detail and not being
                    sufficiently involved. Nixon was in between, say, the practices of Ford and
                    Carter. President Ford was quite removed from foreign policy, although Ford had
                    great confidence in Kissinger as Secretary of State. In fairness to President
                    Ford he had to heal the nation after the Watergate Affair. The other extreme was
                    President Jimmy Carter, who arguably got into too much detail. I think that
                    President Nixon struck a good balance and had enough confidence in Kissinger,
                    who held views parallel to his, and was sufficiently brilliant as a diplomat and
                    tactician that President Nixon could leave the daily work to him.</p>
                <p>Q: One also has the feeling, from what I gather, that President Nixon really
                    didn't like confrontations. Obviously, Henry Kissinger didn't exactly shy away
                    from confrontations.</p>
                <p>LORD: That is a very good comment as well. You are absolutely right. President
                    Nixon hated confrontations. And if there was dirty work to be done, such as to
                    tell somebody that their policy recommendation wasn't going to be accepted, or
                    tell someone that they were fired, or tell someone that they were going to be
                    left out of a trip or a negotiation, or pass on any bad news or any tough
                    message, President Nixon would give it to Bob Haldeman or Kissinger, or Al Haig,
                    as time went on. So President Nixon avoided confrontation. There's no question
                    about that.</p>
                <p>There's a lot more to be said about the Nixon-Kissinger relationshiat some point.
                    We don't have to do it now.</p>
                <p>Q: We won't talk about it now, but I'll make a note about it. I realize that you
                    were below the top level there, but did you pick up a feeling, early on, of
                    Haldeman as being part of the problem? You already had had that confrontation
                    with him. You had worked for him as a volunteer. He was a pretty cold cookie.
                    How did you feel about him?</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, we felt very segregated from the domestic staff at the White House.
                    As I look back and particularly at Watergate, how thankful I am that this was
                    the case. However, I have to be fair here. Bob Haldeman was never insulting to
                    me, personally. Nor was John Ehrlichman or any of the others. And certainly not
                    Ron Ziegler or Dwight Chapin who were friendly. I had cordial relations with
                    many of these people. I had to travel with them on presidential trips.</p>
                <p>Equally, there is no question that Haldeman and Ehrlichman and the others came
                    from a different culture and political background from Kissinger and the rest of
                    us. They were, of course and above all, preoccupied with domestic politics and
                    the domestic base of President Nixon. As time went on, they distrusted
                    Kissinger, to a certain extent. They, like Nixon, felt that Kissinger was often
                    going around, portraying himself as moderate and dovish, warming up to the
                    Georgetown crowd, the Washington Post and the New York Times and painting
                    President Nixon as a mad man. Or, Kissinger was getting credit for policies
                    which Nixon should have gotten credit for.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>Their concern was loyalty to President Nixon, making sure that the President kept
                    control of things, that his political bases were covered, that he got credit in
                    the history books, and so on. On top of that, their view was that the staff
                    being assembled or suggested by Kissinger seemed pretty liberal, East Coast, and
                    elitist. They had some suspicion of this.</p>
                <p>So, for all of these reasons, they purposely set out to keep the NSC staff and
                    the domestic staff of the White House pretty well separated. I don't know all
                    the actual facts on this, because I'm not sure that Kissinger in fact went out
                    of his way to help us on this. However, the NSC staff, except for Kissinger and
                    then Al Haig, when he became Kissinger's deputy, never had access to the White
                    House mess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was very important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: It was very important. It was not so much a matter of prestige. It was a
                    matter of convenience. Particularly when I was a Special Assistant to Kissinger,
                    my average work day literally ended at about 10:00 PM. I would have to go into
                    the White House mess, order a sandwich or something, and take it out and eat it
                    at my desk. I would do this at about 7:00 or 8:00 PM. So we had carry out
                    privileges, as it were, but never any real access to the White House mess and we
                    never fraternized much with people on the domestic side of the White House.</p>
                <p>None of us, except at the very top, had parking privileges, which were also
                    important. Often I would finish work at 11:00 PM or midnight. I'd have to walk
                    about 15 minutes to the place on the Ellipse south of the White House where I
                    had parked my car. This didn't involve a security problem, but it certainly was
                    a pain in the neck.</p>
                <p>Now, I am told that Kissinger never really went to bat that much for NSC staff
                    members to be admitted to the White House mess, for example, because he
                    allegedly didn't want us mingling that much with the domestic staff. I don't
                    know how much truth there is in this, but certainly Haldeman and his team gave
                    us second billinin terms of access, privileges, and perquisites. Actually, they
                    were the people who got Nixon elected. They were the ones who had done the hard
                    work and were the Nixon loyalists over the years. Whereas most of the people on
                    the NSC staff were probably Democratic Party sympathizers or liberals from the
                    State Department. They were somewhat suspect. There was always that kind of
                    feeling.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>Now, of course, Haldeman and Ehrlichman recognized the extent that Kissinger and
                    his staff helped to pull off major diplomatic successes for President Nixon.
                    They approved of what had been done, but there was always the feeling that we
                    were not to be totally trusted and integrated in the operation. As I say,
                    looking back, I would like to have had access to the White House mess and
                    parking privileges, but I don't regret not having been further involved with
                    some of these White House characters.V. NSC - NIXON, KISSINGER. (1969-1973)</p>
                <p>Q: I always put at the end of a segment where we finished up to help in picking
                    up the narrative later on. We've talked about setting up the NSC staff under
                    Nixon and a bit about relations with Bob Haldeman and others. However, we
                    haven't yet talked about the issues. We haven't really talked about your
                    observations on Kissinger and President Nixon...</p>
                <p>LORD: You mean individually and the relationship between them?</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. And particularly we haven't talked about any of the issues which were
                    outstanding early in 1969. So we'll pick up the interview at that point.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is May 14, 1998. Let's talk first about your impressions oPresident Nixon,
                    particularly early on in his administration.</p>
                <p>LORD: Sure. I had worked for Nixon as a volunteer in the 1960 presidential
                    campaign, as we discussed earlier. I knew his dark side, of course, but also
                    felt that he was very well equipped to be President, particularly as far as
                    foreign policy matters were concerned. Therefore, I went to work for him with
                    considerable enthusiasm, and I was also enthusiastic about Kissinger, his
                    brilliance, and his potential.</p>
                <p>I think that the best portrayal of Nixon that I've seen remains Kissinger's
                    portrait in the first volume of his memoirs, in which he captures the complexity
                    of Nixon. First, regarding Nixon's strengths, I should say that in terms of my
                    exposure to him it was considerable but not intimate and certainly not on a
                    daily basis. Kissinger generally liked to meet with Nixon alone, as opposed to
                    having NSC staff people with him. This was both a reflection of Kissinger's ego,
                    on the one hand, and his not wishing to have others there, which reflected
                    Kissinger's insecurity. Kissinger sought to control access to President Nixon in
                    many ways. This was true in the case of briefings, meetings, or, for example, at
                    decision-making sessions after meetings.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>However, I sat in on a great many meetings with President Nixon and some strategy
                    sessions with him, as well. As we discussed previously, I was with Nixon on the
                    plane to China. I sat in on all of the meetings Nixon had with Mao Zedong and
                    Zhou Enlai. I was with him at the Moscow Summit Meeting. I traveled with him as
                    we went beyond Moscow on that trip to Romania, Iran, etc. I once went up to Camp
                    David, Maryland, at a crucial moment, before the May 1972 Summit Meeting in
                    Moscow, when Hanoi launched a new offensive in South Vietnam. So I had
                    intermittent access to President Nixon. At San Clemente, CA, I was out there at
                    New Year's, working on Nixon's annual foreign policy reports. There would be
                    some interaction with the President on these occasions. Then, of course, I also
                    had considerable exposure to Nixon, through Kissinger, in terms of his comments
                    and his relationship with President Nixon. Occasionally, I would be listening on
                    the phone with Kissinger when he'd be talking with Nixon, often in the evening.
                    Sometimes, Nixon would be swearing in his special language, either because he
                    was tired or he had had a few drinks. So that's just to give you a feel for my
                    exposure to him.</p>
                <p>Now, regarding the man himself, not only based on the previous evidence but on
                    the observations of others, which reinforced my impressions. The good side of
                    Nixon, in terms of sheer strategy and conceptual strength in foreign policy, was
                    very good, indeed. He had had considerable experience in terms of travel and
                    meetings as Vice President. He had done a lot of thinking and reading, and
                    indeed writing, including his famous article in 1967 in “Foreign Affairs.”</p>
                <p>So he had a very clear strategy when he came into office as President. In
                    particular, he had some basic goals. I want to add quickly that his strategy was
                    very close to Kissinger's, but they came at it independently. They hadn't really
                    known each other very well. I think that they had only met once or so before
                    Nixon became President. They hadn't really discussed much, so Nixon had some
                    courage in choosing Kissinger, despite this lack of personal contact and the
                    fact that Kissinger was in direct contrast with Nixon. Kissinger was a Harvard
                    educated intellectual, of Jewish immigrant origin, and an establishment,
                    Rockefeller type person, whereas Nixon was from an anti-communist, California,
                    modest income, American family background.</p>
                <p>Clearly, what Nixon and Kissinger had in mind was first, and as the highest
                    priority, to deal with problems involving the communist world. They wanted to
                    have good relations with our allies and to get to issues like the Middle East.
                    However, the three overriding challenges were to: end the war in Vietnam, open
                    up a new relationship with China, and try to improve the relationship with the
                    Soviet Union. These issues were, of course, interrelated. By improving relations
                    with China and Russia they could put pressure on Hanoi to negotiate, since they
                    were Hanoi's two major patrons. So Nixon had a clear feel for geopolitics. He
                    had a sense, and we will get into greater detail on this, that by opening up to
                    China he would loosen up our diplomacy generally and that he wouldn't have to
                    deal with only Moscow in talking with the communist world.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>Nixon obviously had a sense by then, and many Americans were slow to come to this
                    appreciation, that the Sino-Soviet split was real. This became very clear after
                    the clashes on the Sino-Soviet border in the summer of 1969. Nixon saw other
                    advantages in establishing contact with China as the world's most populous
                    nation. Above all he wanted to put pressure on the Soviet Union to get them to
                    be more forthcoming toward us, by showing that we had an option by going to
                    China. This was the so-called “China card,” a term which was exaggerated. Nixon
                    wanted to have good relations with Russia as well. He wanted to have better
                    relations with each of these large, communist nations than they had with each
                    other.Nixon also hoped, and here he put more emphasis than Kissinger ever did on
                    this point, that Russia would help him end the war in Vietnam. During the
                    presidential campaign of 1968 Nixon talked about having a secret plan to end the
                    war in Vietnam. He didn't really have a secret plan. I think that his main
                    emphasis was that improving relations with the two communist giants, and
                    particularly the Soviet Union, would help to bring pressure on Hanoi to end the
                    war.</p>
                <p>So Nixon's greatest strength was his conceptual approach to foreign policy, his
                    geopolitical feel, and his sense of strategy as he entered office.</p>
                <p>Q: There you were, often the note taker. Were these points articulated by Nixon
                    and Kissinger, or is this something that you are putting together later?</p>
                <p>LORD: It's a combination of both. Certainly, these views were articulated by
                    Kissinger in my presence. They were also articulated in annual, Presidential
                    reports, which hold up very well in retrospect, by the way. Nixon put them out
                    every year, usually by early February. We would draft them at President Nixon's
                    home in San Clemente, CA, in late December to mid-January. They were highly
                    conceptual statements of U.S. foreign policy. They often gave some sense of the
                    direction in which we were heading, including the opening to China if people
                    read these statements carefully.</p>
                <p>So this version of Nixon's views is partly derived from secondary sources but
                    partly from conversations in my presence. Certainly, they reflected the way
                    President Nixon conducted himself in meetings.</p>
                <p>I would like to add somewhat to the strengths of President Nixon, and then we'll
                    get to the weaknesses, particularly during the White House years. During the
                    early years of his Presidency, and while I was in the White House, President
                    Nixon did his homework before meetings and conducted himself extremely well at
                    them. Later, it became noticeable, as the Watergate affair began to overtake
                    him, that he was less meticulous about his preparations for meetings and so
                    on.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>The strategy papers that we helped to write for him reflected Kissinger's views.
                    However, we knew that they were also consistent with the President's views. I've
                    come to these conclusions, given my exposure to him in meetings and what I had
                    read at the time and since. I think that most observers, including even harsh
                    critics of Nixon, would say that this strategic approach was one of his great
                    strengths.</p>
                <p>Also, I think that one of his strengths, compared to other Presidents, before and
                    since, was that he delegated just enough in the foreign policy field. He was a
                    strategist, along with Kissinger, and they reinforced each other. But Nixon made
                    the crucial decisions, whether they involved the opening to China, whether it
                    was bombing Hanoi and mining the harbor at Haiphong, thereby jeopardizing the
                    Moscow summit meeting, or whether it was the Middle East alert a little bit
                    later on, at the beginning of his second term. He made a lot of courageous
                    decisions. He was the conceptual thinker behind these decisions. However, he
                    would not get bogged down in details. He had confidence in Kissinger to do the
                    basic negotiating and moving forward. He clearly was in general charge of the
                    strategy. Therefore, he was on top of it in a way that, say, President Ford
                    never was in terms of detailed, strategic grasp. He didn't get bogged down in
                    minute details, as President Carter tended to do. Nixon's involvement, on the
                    one hand, but his willingness to delegate, on the other hand, were about in
                    balance. He steered between micromanagement, on the one hand, which no President
                    really has time for, and detachment and lack of strategic impact on the other,
                    which a President shouldn't have either.</p>
                <p>In this sense Nixon and Kissinger worked well together. Of course, as time went
                    on, this balance changed, particularly as Kissinger began to develop a higher,
                    public profile, achieved more spectacular successes, and made more frequent
                    trips and undertook dramatic initiatives. There was a real, mixed feeling or
                    rivalry between the two men, and I'll get back to that. Nixon became somewhat
                    jealous of Kissinger for getting some of the credit which Nixon thought he,
                    himself, deserved.</p>
                <p>So these were his basic strengths. Now, his weaknesses obviously include
                    paranoia. Nixon always felt that the liberal press and the establishment were
                    out to get him and didn't respect him. This is also reflected in the complex
                    relationship similar to that which President L. B. Johnson had with the Kennedy
                    legacy, and so on. Kennedy was the polar opposite of Nixon's style. This also
                    fed into his suspicions, including all of the manifestations of the Watergate
                    affair, which came to cripple Nixon's presidency.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>Nixon had some unattractive elements, for example, of anti-Semitism, which
                    Kissinger has recorded. I heard these a couple of times when I was listening in
                    on the telephone. However, Nixon would often do this in front of Kissinger, so
                    you wonder just how profound it was. I can't judge the degree of Nixon's
                    drinking problem. I don't think that it should be exaggerated. It was clearly
                    exaggerated in the Oliver Stone movie on Nixon. However, there is no question
                    that he had a problem. I was on the phone a couple of times, taking notes for
                    Kissinger, when President Nixon clearly had had a few drinks. But I believe he
                    only indulged at night, not during the day. I do not think that this problem
                    affected his presidency in any significant way. That is my clear understanding
                    of the matter.</p>
                <p>Nixon also could be devious. These are some aspects of Nixon's dark side, which
                    have been well documented by others, and I really can't add much to it. He was a
                    shy person, not particularly gifted with small talk. If you were standing around
                    with him, it could be somewhat awkward. This is not necessarily a negative
                    aspect of his personality, in point of fact.</p>
                <p>As I said before, Nixon didn't like direct confrontations and so he would have
                    Haldeman in particular to handle them as his hatchet man. If he had bad news for
                    Secretary of State Rogers - cutting him out of something or a decision going
                    against his recommendation - or against Secretary of Defense Laird or another
                    member of the cabinet, the chances are that he wouldn't convey it directly to
                    the cabinet officer concerned. He would have Haldeman do it or, somewhat later,
                    Al Haig, as he became the First Deputy NSC Advisor and eventually Chief of
                    Staff. There are more issues that I could get into, but I'm sort of giving you
                    an overview now.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you mention, particularly early on in his administration, how Nixon
                    treated his Secretary of State, William Rogers? He was an old friend of Nixon's.
                    We'll get to Kissinger later on. Did you have any feel for how Nixon treated
                    Rogers?</p>
                <p>LORD: Again, Nixon would never be directly rude with Rogers or anybody else. I
                    have to stress that I obviously would not have been in very many meetings where
                    there were just Nixon and Rogers. A good many of the meetings I attended with
                    Nixon were just with Kissinger. For example, during the Nixon summit meetinin
                    China, Secretary of State Rogers was off with the Chinese Foreign Minister. As
                    has been discussed earlier, Nixon hired Rogers because he knew that he would be
                    loyal, someone whom he looked to take care of the secondary issues while he and
                    Kissinger focused on the big three issues which I mentioned before of Russia,
                    China, and Vietnam and, to a certain extent, the Middle East. This doesn't mean
                    that Nixon and Kissinger weren't heavily involved in Berlin, Europe, and many
                    other issues. However, whether it involved Latin America, Africa, or perhaps
                    economic issues, Nixon felt that Rogers could handle those while he and
                    Kissinger dealt with the more urgent and cosmic tasks.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>Nixon clearly wanted Rogers excluded from the discussions at times. I don't think
                    that he was personally against Rogers, but it was a combination of his wanting
                    to direct major policy areas without a lot of interference and because of his
                    suspicion of the State Department, a flashback to his resentment of bureaucrats
                    and what he thought of as their liberal bias. So Nixon would often exclude
                    Rogers from a lot of the secret negotiations and trips.</p>
                <p>Every now and then Nixon would feel a little concerned about this exclusion of
                    Rogers. For example, and we'll get into this later, when Kissinger went on his
                    secret trip to China, Rogers did not know about the trip when Kissinger took
                    off. Nixon made it clear to Kissinger, even though Kissinger was worried about
                    leaks, that Rogers had to know about this trip as it was taking place. I don't
                    remember the exact sequence, but he conveyed the information about the trip to
                    Rogers, through Haldeman, Haig, or someone else. Rogers was told that this
                    invitation had come from the Chinese, sort of at the last minute, while
                    Kissinger was traveling, and Kissinger was going to go on into China. There was
                    the usual duplicity in the treatment of Rogers.</p>
                <p>I would have to assume, from everything that I saw, that Nixon was perfectly
                    polite to Rogers at meetings. He wouldn't humiliate him. That wouldn't be his
                    style. But clearly, the outcome was to cut Rogers out of things.</p>
                <p>Q: I was just wondering whether, while you were there and Kissinger was talking
                    with Nixon, the President said: “Oh, Rogers. Forget about him.” Did he say
                    something like that?</p>
                <p>LORD: It's hard to remember precise instances. However, that was the consequence.
                    I don't think that Nixon would open up like that in front of other people. He
                    might do it when he was alone with Kissinger, Haldeman, or Ehrlichman. However,
                    if a member of the NSC staff, like myself, were there, I doubt that he would do
                    that. I don't recall specifically his doing that. You could argue that he would
                    not do that for reasons of decency.</p>
                <p>The classic example of cutting Rogers out, and we'll get to it, was the Mao
                    meeting with Nixon, which Zhou Enlai announced soon after Kissinger's arrival in
                    Beijing. Nixon wanted just Kissinger to go with him to the meeting. Kissinger
                    said in his own memoirs that, even though it was Nixon's desire, Kissinger now
                    felt that it was irresponsible on his part in not telling Nixon that Secretary
                    of State Rogers should be included in the party. In that meeting with Mao, and
                    we'll come to it, they were at least sufficiently sensitive to Rogers' feelings
                    that, even though I was at the meeting, I was cut out of the photograph and any
                    reference to me in the communique. The reason for this - and the result was that
                    although Rogers was already humiliated that Kissinger, as National Security
                    Adviser, was with the President at the meeting with Chairman Mao, (and he was
                    not) he would not be further humiliated by not only having the National Security
                    Adviser with him but a member of the NSC staff as well, while the Secretary of
                    State was not present.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>I don't think that Nixon wanted to go out of his way directly to humiliate
                    Rogers. However, the net result was that he did. Nixon wanted to control foreign
                    policy. He wanted to keep it so that it wouldn't be complicated by the
                    bureaucrats in the State Department, and Kissinger, of course, did not resist
                    this, to say the least.</p>
                <p>Q: We've been talking about how Kissinger set up his staff and so forth. What was
                    your interpretation of the relationship between Kissinger and President
                    Nixon?</p>
                <p>LORD: It was very complicated and has been well described in Kissinger's memoirs
                    and, to a certain extent, in Nixon's own memoirs. On the one hand, there was
                    obviously some mutual respect for each other's geopolitical savvy and conceptual
                    strength. Nixon and Kissinger generally saw things the same way in terms of how
                    to approach foreign policy issues, including a greater emphasis on geopolitics
                    rather than on matters like, say, human rights, trade, and other problems. They
                    agreed on the broad lines about ending the Vietnam War, how to go about the
                    opening to China, how to go about dealing with the Russians, using sticks and
                    carrots, incentives and pressures. So there was general agreement between them
                    and genuine, mutual admiration.Nixon appreciated the way Kissinger carried out
                    his policies, as well as his conceptual ideas. Nixon realized that Kissinger was
                    brilliant as a tactician and negotiator. Even if Kissinger would get a lot of
                    the credit, this would also redound to Nixon's Presidency and to Nixon
                    personally. If Kissinger could end the Vietnam War, open up relations with
                    China, make progress in det�nte with the Russians, and make progress in the
                    Middle East, even though Kissinger was the day to day tactician and would get a
                    lot of the credit, this would also help Nixon. So all of this was the plus side
                    of their relations.</p>
                <p>The minus side of their relations presented a totally different side of Nixon's
                    personality, as I've already said, whether it involved anti-Semitism, the
                    distrust of Harvard intellectuals, and so on. There was cultural tension between
                    Nixon and Kissinger. There was never any intimacy on that side of things. As
                    time went on, Nixon was increasingly resentful of the credit which Kissinger
                    would get. Sometimes Nixon would take responsibility away from Kissinger or even
                    supersede him on some matters. Nixon deeply resented the fact that he and
                    Kissinger were chosen jointly as Men of the Year by “Time” magazine. Kissinger
                    claimed that he was sufficiently nervous about that that he tried to talk “Time”
                    out of it and give credit to Nixon only. I never quite decided whether to
                    believe that or not.</p>
                <p>Nixon also felt, and frankly with some justification, that Kissinger would go
                    around to the press and to Georgetown parties and, at times, portray himself as
                    the reasonable, moderate, dovish, liberal influence in the Nixon administration.
                    He portrayed himself as trying to rein in this hawkish and unpredictable
                    President. It would be done subtly, but there was no question that Kissinger was
                    very skillful with the press. As time went on Kissinger gave the impression that
                    he was more restrained and moderate than Nixon. Kissinger was equally good with
                    hard line conservatives and right wingers, making it clear that he, Kissinger,
                    was a very tough guy as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>Kissinger was very good at talking to different audiences, using different
                    nuances, and we'll get into that. So you couldn't catch him in actually
                    contradicting himself by comparing transcripts of interviews and speeches. When
                    people talked to Kissinger, they had the feeling that he empathized with their
                    point of view, even if they were ideologically at different poles. Whether they
                    were conservatives or liberals, each one felt that Kissinger at least understood
                    their point of view and may have been sympathetic with it. This was a tribute to
                    Kissinger's brilliance as well as his deviousness.</p>
                <p>Anyway, to return to the relationship between Nixon and Kissinger, when there
                    would be columns, perhaps by Joe Alsop, James Reston, Joe Kraft, or others,
                    which were favorable to Kissinger, and sometimes, by implication, they would be
                    critical of Nixon. Nixon suspected that Kissinger was burnishing his own image
                    at the expense of the President. I don't think that this was necessarily
                    misplaced paranoia on Nixon's part.</p>
                <p>Having said that, I must note that it worked the other way at times. When they
                    got down to the home stretch of the Vietnam agreement, I believe that Nixon,
                    with the help of Al Haig and probably some of the White House staff, were giving
                    the impression that Kissinger had made some tactical mistakes, and there was
                    some doubt about the agreement. So this process worked both ways. You had this
                    very complicated mix of egos and so on. Each man had recorded tremendous
                    achievements and had great self-confidence, on the one hand, but also
                    insecurity, on the other hand. This made for a very complicated
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>Kissinger would claim, and again, I think, with some justification, that there
                    were times when he would receive orders and instructions from the President
                    which he considered really crazy. He would feel, at times, that these were
                    influenced by the President's alcoholic intake, especially in the evening.
                    Kissinger would often sit on such instructions and ignore them. He thought that
                    Nixon would come to his senses or forget about them or wouldn't come back to
                    them. Kissinger said that he would let these instructions die of their own
                    weight. At other times Nixon would keep coming back to them, and Kissinger would
                    have to implement them. However, he did it in a way that he thought would
                    moderate the damage.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, Kissinger, in private, in public, and in his memoirs, gives
                    Nixon full credit for his geopolitical grasp and his courage in making the
                    difficult decisions.</p>
                <p>Q: At the time of the Vietnam War Nixon himself seemed to be deliberately playing
                    the madman at the helm who was capable of doing anything. Did you see anything
                    like that?</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>LORD: That was more calculated. Nixon himself wanted to get that impression out.
                    He wanted Hanoi, in particular, to figure that they couldn't count on Nixon
                    being restrained in terms of military action or any other way. That kind of
                    image tended to be put out in collusion between Nixon and Kissinger. That wasn't
                    an image which Nixon necessarily objected to. I think that it was of tactical
                    benefit to him, actually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there was this late night impression of irrationality
                        thawould come out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever see any of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I heard a couple of conversations where Nixon was making comments on some
                    people. In any case, I didn't hear that many conversations between Nixon and
                    Kissinger. NSC staffers were just asked to listen in on some telephone calls and
                    to take notes for action purposes. In retrospect, I think that Nixon kind of
                    assumed that someone was listening in, but it probably would have been better if
                    Nixon had been told that Kissinger had one of his staff persons taking notes on
                    the phone call. In all honesty, it was not meant for any devious purpose.
                    Kissinger was extremely busy. When he received instructions from Nixon, he
                    wanted to be able to follow up on them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In these conversations that you were aware of, did Nixon
                        ask “How will this play in Congress or how will this play with the media?”
                        In other words, Kissinger was supposed to be the foreign affairs expert.
                        Nixon was obviously the politician. You can't get anywhere in the U.S.
                        Government unless you figure out how you're going to make something work
                        with Congress, the press, and all of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: It's fascinating to talk about that, but I don't want to exaggerate the
                    number of times that I heard Nixon and Kissinger on the phone or even in person.
                    These phone conversations I listened in on wouldn't have occurred more than a
                    handful of occasions.</p>
                <p>I want to make it clear that I was not privy to the overwhelming majority of
                    Nixon-Kissinger conversations, either bilaterally or with other persons present.
                    But one can assume that they would talk often about how to handle Congress,
                    particularly on issues like Vietnam and what levels we could authorize for
                    troops, foreign aid, support for bombing, and, as the war continued, heading off
                    damaging resolutions restricting our military activity in Vietnam.</p>

                <p>I think that, probably in terms of domestic politics more generally, and the
                    press and media, Nixon would talk more to Haldeman, Ziegler, and others.
                    However, he would certainly discuss these kinds of things with Kissinger. No
                    question about that.</p>
                <p>I believe that Kissinger himself never gave any press conferences on the record
                    until his famous, peace is at hand press conference in October, 1972, when Hanoi
                    released the details of the agreement we were negotiating with them. This was
                    the first press conference he gave on the record, instead of on a background
                    basis. For an academic like Kissinger who had never previously served in
                    government he showed an amazing understanding, not only of bureaucratic
                    infighting but of handling the press. That was one of his strengths.</p>
                <p>In some ways this helped Nixon because it helped explain to the press the
                    conceptual framework for Nixon-Kissinger policies and also helped build support
                    for what we were trying to do on various fronts. However, to the extent that the
                    press began to praise Kissinger and he got more attention and profile, at times
                    this began to feed Nixon's paranoia and sense of envy.</p>
                <p>In terms of substance one of the main disagreements that I can remember between
                    Nixon and Kissinger was that Nixon wanted to extract more from the Russians on
                    Vietnam, as opposed to other issues in the Russian-American relationship. There
                    were times when Kissinger would be moving on SALT [Strategic Arms Limitation
                    Talks] or some other, bilateral matters with the Russians. Nixon would want to
                    slow things down unless the Russians did more to pressure Hanoi. Kissinger was
                    clearly in favor of the Russians leaning on Hanoi, and the Chinese also, for
                    that matter, but I think that Kissinger felt that we had very important business
                    to handle with the Russians, whether this involved negotiations on Berlin, arms
                    control, or other matters. Nixon wanted to hold the Soviet-American relationship
                    somewhat more hostage to the Soviets providing help on Vietnam. So that was one
                    area of difference between Nixon and Kissinger.</p>
                <p>At times, in the home stretch, the hectic home stretch of the Vietnam talks,
                    there were some differences between Nixon and Kissinger. However, I think that
                    some of this was fed by Al Haig, who was somewhat more hard line on Vietnam than
                    Kissinger was.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>There were certainly other, tactical disagreements. However, I think that it's
                    fair to say that Nixon and Kissinger were generally on the same wave length on
                    the broad outlines of policy. This was certainly the case on China. There were
                    never any significant disagreements there. On Vietnam I think that it's fair to
                    say that Nixon was generally more suspicious than Kissinger as to whether the
                    North Vietnamese were negotiating seriously to end the war. Kissinger, without
                    being naive about North Vietnamese intentions, tended to see more hope in that
                    secret negotiating process than, I think, Nixon did. I think that Nixon felt
                    that the North Vietnamese would dig in. In retrospect, I think that Nixon was
                    right, up until the break-through in October, 1972. Every time that Kissinger
                    and I thought that we were making some progress, Nixon tended to be more
                    skeptical. In retrospect, I think that Nixon was entirely right. The North
                    Vietnamese did not come around until they saw that Nixon was going to be
                    re-elected over Senator George McGovern.</p>
                <p>The basic point that I am making is that on substance, conceptually, and even in
                    terms of tactical execution, Nixon and Kissinger were pretty close in
                    outlook.</p>
                <p>One other thing that I should say is that Kissinger genuinely, and he said this
                    in his memoirs, believed that Nixon deserved lots of credit for the successes
                    that were achieved and his courage in making lonely decisions on major issues.
                    After all, Nixon sent Kissinger into China alone, and really without anybody
                    else knowing about it, risking a tremendous backlash from our allies and, above
                    all, from his conservative base in the Republican Party and elsewhere at home.
                    In retrospect, historical revisionists like to say that the rapprochement and
                    opening with China was inevitable, that it made Nixon popular, and so forth.
                    However, in all fairness when he authorized this opening to China, he couldn't
                    be sure of that in advance.</p>
                <p>Nixon took courageous decisions in bombing Hanoi and mining Haiphong, risking the
                    1972 summit meeting with Moscow, where there were a lot of agreements lined up
                    and ready for signature. I think that Kissinger always felt, despite his mixed
                    feelings toward Nixon, that the President deserved credit for making these tough
                    decisions, which only a President could make. Kissinger admired Nixon's
                    strategic grasp and the fact that he generally backed up Kissinger. Of course,
                    Kissinger liked the fact that Nixon wanted to run things out of the White House
                    and cut out the bureaucracy. Kissinger had no objection to that.</p>
                <p>At the same time Kissinger tended to reciprocate Nixon's views toward him.
                    Kissinger was suspicious as to whether Nixon was bad mouthing him to Haldeman
                    and Ehrlichman, behind his back. In fact, Nixon was doing this. He was
                    constantly doing this, as we know now from the White House tapes. He told
                    Haldeman and Ehrlichman to keep their eye on Kissinger. I don't think that
                    Kissinger thought that Nixon was reflecting any profound anti-Semitism which
                    some of his comments suggest. I think that Kissinger always admired Nixon for
                    having the courage to choose him, Kissinger, even though Nixon hardly knew him
                    and even though he knew that Kissinger was very different from the rest of the
                    White House staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>Nixon also gave Kissinger wide discretion in choosing his own staff at the NSC,
                    although over time I think that Nixon began to suspect that this staff was a
                    little too liberal for his taste. He suspected that some of the White House
                    leaks were coming from that NSC staff. Kissinger had genuine admiration for
                    Nixon's strengths but, of course, he saw Nixon's dark side as well. There is no
                    sense in my going into great length on this subject because I think that
                    Kissinger has described this very well in his own memoirs.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, let's move on to you. When you were first hired to be on the NSC staff,
                    what was your role, and how did it evolve? Then, we'll move...</p>
                <p>LORD: During the first year of the Nixon first term [1969] I was sitting in the
                    Executive Office Building. I had two jobs: helping to run the NSC system and
                    writing policy planning memorandums, including some that were critical of
                    policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">[Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: You talked about some of it. You
                        didn'discuss the transition...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, I will do this at the risk of some repetition. I know that we talked
                    about my initial interview with Kissinger and his emphasis on loyalty, and so
                    on. I believe that I mentioned that the one thing he never wanted was yes men.
                    He could intimidate people, and we'll get into that in a minute, with his
                    intellectual brilliance and even his temper. However, he genuinely wanted good,
                    counter arguments.</p>
                <p>During the first year I was working for Mort Halperin, sitting in the Executive
                    Office Building. We had two, basic roles: one was to help to run the NSC system,
                    that is, the various meetings and how they were run, with the National Security
                    Adviser chairing almost everything and then putting decision memoranda together.
                    I was responsible for helping to prepare the agendas, talking points, and
                    strategy for those meetings, as well as following up on their results. I helped
                    to package the memoranda from the various agencies, plus our memoranda for the
                    President, looking toward NSC meetings and Presidential decisions.</p>
                <p>The other role we played was that of a mini Policy Planning Staff, in which
                    Halperin or I would write memos to Kissinger, pointing out issues that would be
                    coming up and which he ought to be thinking about. We would also play devil's
                    advocate on some current policies which we thought might need adjustment.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>It was particularly in the latter role of devil's advocate that I caught
                    Kissinger's attention. Of course, I had been sitting in on many of the meetings
                    in the NSC system. He had seen the work I had done with Mort Halperin in
                    preparing material for Presidential speeches on Vietnam and sending ideas to
                    Kissinger. I think that what particularly caught Kissinger's attention was the
                    fact that I had written some memos which Halperin passed through directly,
                    making clear that they came from me, including some which were critical but
                    well-reasoned enough to earn Kissinger's attention. I remember in particular a
                    memorandum on Laos. I remember another one on Africa, regarding which, I felt,
                    we should be more responsive to the racial dimension there, both because it
                    would help us geopolitically, vis-a-vis the Soviets, in terms of influence in
                    the African continent, and because it would respond to domestic concerns and
                    constituencies toward which, I felt, we weren't sufficiently sensitive.</p>
                <p>The point I'm making is that Kissinger welcomed challenges, even if he didn't
                    agree with the thrust of these challenges. I think that these memoranda which I
                    had written caught his attention.</p>
                <p>The role of Special Assistant to Kissinger was generally played by Tony Lake and,
                    to a certain extent, by Roger Morris as well, who were sitting over in the West
                    Wing basement of the White House. These people were privy to the most sensitive
                    material, which I was not, such as the beginnings of the opening to China, the
                    secret Vietnam negotiations, the Cambodian bombing, and so on. These were some
                    issues that I wasn't quite cut in on. I can't remember which issues I knew
                    nothing about and which issues I only knew something about. I was exposed to a
                    very great deal, through running the NSC system with Mort Halperin, but I didn't
                    know everything.</p>
                <p>However, Tony Lake made clear to Kissinger that, mostly because of exhaustion,
                    and not so much out of substantive disagreement, he was planning to leave the
                    NSC staff in early 1970. It is true that the incursion into Cambodia, which took
                    place in the spring of 1970, was the proximate cause of Lake's resignation,
                    along with those of several others. The fact is, he was going to leave the NSC
                    staff anyway. This event speeded up the process and also gave it a certain
                    cachet. I'm not challenging Lake's sincerity in leaving out of disagreement with
                    this policy. I also disagreed with this policy, but Kissinger liked to point out
                    that Lake was going to leave the NSC staff anyway.</p>
                <p>So when Lake was leaving, he needed a replacement. Al Haig came to me on behalf
                    of Kissinger. I don't remember the exact date, but it must have been in January
                    or February, 1970. Haig said: “Would you like to take Lake's place as Special
                    Assistant to Kissinger?”</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>I still can't believe that I did what I did. For some reason I at least strongly
                    indicated to Haig that I would decline, before checking with my wife. I have a
                    terrific marriage and I consulted her on all major issues, because I genuinely
                    value her opinion. I feel that this should be a matter of principle in a
                    marriage. I just dreaded the office hours I would have to keep if I replaced
                    Tony Lake. I knew what he had gone through. Not that my office hours were all of
                    that relaxed, but I was working from about 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM. I knew that Lake
                    was working from 7:00 AM to 10:00 or 11:00 PM and spent most of his weekends on
                    the job. I am enough of a family man that I knew that I just didn't want to keep
                    those hours.</p>
                <p>I went out to have dinner at a restaurant with my wife, which was somewhat of an
                    unusual occurrence, given my work schedule. I told her what I had done.
                    “Exploded” is too strong a word, but she said that this was absurd. It wasn't so
                    much that she was mad that I hadn't consulted her, although she must have
                    considered that puzzling. She thought that this was a stupid decision. She told
                    me, in her usual, straightforward way, that I had an opportunity to be a close
                    associate of Kissinger, whom she considered the most brilliant man at the time
                    on the Washington scene and someone who was on the verge of accomplishing great
                    things. So just from the point of view of my own, personal exposure, career, and
                    learning curve, she thought that I had made a crazy decision. Beyond that, in
                    terms of public service and trying to help my country, she felt that I had an
                    obligation to take this job, work with Kissinger, and do great things, including
                    ending the Vietnam War. She handed me a quarter - or was it a dime?- to get
                    right back on the phone to Haig and say that I had changed my mind and would
                    accept the job.</p>
                <p>By the way, this also reflected the fact that, despite the incredible hours and
                    everything else, she was totally supportive of me. There was a pattern
                    throughout her comments that she thought that this was an historic opportunity
                    for a young person, barely 30 years of age, to be exposed to great issues and
                    great men, as well as her feeling that this was an opportunity to serve my
                    country.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, I'm sure that I must have said to Haig that my answer was probably
                    “no” but that I wanted to talk over the offer with my wife. After talking it
                    over with her, I realized that I had made a rather impetuous decision. I called
                    Haig back later that night. I can't remember whether I said that I wanted to
                    think about it further or whether I immediately accepted the offer. In any
                    event, I accepted very quickly. Of course, this was the wisest thing I ever did.
                    I would have missed an historic opportunity to be in the middle of dramatic
                    events and help to advance what I think were positive causes. Even though things
                    didn't always turn out the way I liked, I at least had a chance to make my case.
                    Also, of course, I was stretched incredibly, both intellectually, emotionally,
                    and in every other way. It was a breakthrough for my career, and we did
                    accomplish some major goals, so it was clearly the right decision.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>Without jumping forward at any length, I should say that this happened on
                    several, other occasions, where my wife steered me in the right direction. I had
                    been a Foreign Service Officer but left the Foreign Service in 1967, despite my
                    affection for the service. I had been well treated by it, on the whole, but
                    basically my wife considered that I was on a very slow road to real challenges
                    and responsibilities. After five and one-half years in the Foreign Service, she
                    urged me to leave and take a job in the Department of Defense [in 1967]. There
                    was a later time, in 1985, when I was offered the ambassadorship to China. We'll
                    get to that. My initial reaction was: “No, thank you, I'd rather have a job in
                    the State Department, say on the seventh floor,” [where the Secretary of State
                    and his principal assistants have their offices]. There really wasn't a good
                    opening then, and she said that she thought that I was wrong. I had turned down
                    the ambassadorship partly for family reasons and so on. She again corrected my
                    course.</p>
                <p>So at each of these crucial junctures in my career she was verinfluential in
                    steering me in the right direction.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, I accepted the job of Special Assistant to Kissinger, knowing what I was
                    in for. Of course, it was the best thing that I ever did. So I moved into the
                    West Wing of the White House, in the basement, right near Kissinger's office, in
                    what used to be the men's room.</p>
                <p>I don't think that the hours have ever been matched, certainly in my career, and
                    probably in very few careers. I didn't start the day ofall that early. I got
                    into the office at 7:30 to 8:00 AM, because I insisted on having breakfast with
                    my young children and at least see them then. I knew that, by the time I got
                    home again, they would be in bed, and I wouldn't see them. I sort of made it a
                    point that I wouldn't arrive at the office at an ungodly hour. It might well
                    have been 8:00 AM or even 8:30 AM when I got in. On the average, I left the
                    office somewhere between 10:00 and 11:00 PM, and sometimes at 1:00 or 2:00 AM.
                    On Saturdays I would say that I arrived in the office roughly at 8:30 or 9:00
                    AM, getting home in time for dinner, and then usually spending half a day in the
                    office on Sunday. This was in addition to about 13 secret trips to Paris and
                    elsewhere for Vietnam negotiations as well as all the public trips with Nixon
                    and Kissinger. It involved weekends and holidays when I would pretend that I had
                    time off, when I actually had been out of the country. This is not to complain.
                    It is simply to give you a sense of the pace and demands of the job. It was an
                    exhilarating and a fantastic experience.</p>
                <p>My job was essentially to be Kissinger's global sidekick in the following sense.
                    He had experts on the NSC staff for every major issue and region. He wanted one
                    person who had the overview to put this all together for him. Therefore, I would
                    pair up on China with John Holdridge. I would pair up on Vietnam with Dick
                    Smyser and later with John Negroponte. I would pair up on Russia with Hal
                    Sonnenfeldt and Bill Hyland. I would pair up on the Middle East with Hal
                    Saunders. So there would be a regional expert and then a person who had a more
                    general view. I was more of a generalist. I would help Kissinger integrate these
                    issues, so that in devising overall strategies he had someone who could relate
                    these various issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>For example, one question was how could we use Russia and China to put pressure
                    on Hanoi to negotiate an end to the Vietnam War? This meant, of course, that it
                    was a fantastic opportunity for me because I sat in on the strategy meetings and
                    helped to write the memoranda, together with the experts, on all of these
                    issues. I went on every one of the trips related to these issues involving
                    Russia, China, and Vietnam. So my job was to work with the experts to make sure
                    that Kissinger was ready for these meetings and/or trips. I would help to write
                    the memos to the President, setting out the strategy for these meetings and/or
                    trips, policy meetings, or NSC decisions related to them. Then I helped to
                    implement the decisions, I would sit in on meetings as a note-taker. I would
                    help write reports to the President after the meetings, whether in Washington
                    or, more usually, when we were traveling. I would also help to prepare the
                    transcripts of the meetings. All of this was completely the case for China and
                    Vietnam, much less so on other issues. On some occasions I was instructed to
                    prepare two versions of reports or transcripts of meetings, leaving out some
                    material for the other agencies.</p>
                <p>By the way, Kissinger liked verbatim transcripts, including his jokes. It was
                    easier to do this when a translation was involved, as there was in the case of
                    meetings with the Chinese, Vietnamese, and Russians. There were pauses for
                    translations, and you could keep up a verbatim transcript. I would also sit in
                    when Kissinger was meeting with European leaders, who spoke English. Then
                    keeping up a verbatim transcript was really a frantic job. I was of course more
                    than a note-taker, and others shared this task. I helped to devise strategy and
                    to prepare policy papers and analytical reports to the President afterwards, as
                    well as to suggest where we go from here, especially on China and Vietnam. Of
                    course, I would work closely with the various experts on the NSC staff who knew
                    more about many of these subjects than I did.</p>
                <p>The bulk of my time was spent on China and Vietnam, although there was quite a
                    bit of time spent on Russia and on some of these other issues. Then the other
                    main area that I worked on was drafting in general, including memos, reports,
                    transcripts, and recommendations. If the President were giving a speech, whether
                    at the UN, on Vietnam, and so on, Kissinger would turn to me and some others,
                    including the experts, and ask us to give him either the raw material for the
                    speech or some rough drafts.</p>
                <p>He would then turn this material over to the speech writers. Our job was to get
                    the substance in there, and their job was to package it, as speech writers do,
                    and give it a lift. Nixon had three, very effective speech writers. Each of them
                    fit a certain, ideological mode. The more liberal of the three was a man named
                    Ray Price. If the President wanted an inspirational speech at the UN, for
                    example, chances are that Ray Price would take it on. The most conservative by
                    far was Pat Buchanan. If the President wanted a hell raising or tough speech for
                    the silent majority or attacking the press, he had Pat Buchanan. Then in the
                    middle was Bill Saffire, who is certainly conservative in outlook but in this
                    spectrum of speech writers was sort of in between Price and Buchanan. All three
                    of them were really accomplished wordsmiths, and all of them would greatly
                    improve the rather leaden prose that I would pass up to them.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>I helped to get Kissinger ready for press backgrounders. I would help to prepare
                    sample questions and answers, suggest lines of attack or defense, often working
                    with the other NSC staff experts.</p>
                <p>We turned out annual Presidential Reports. There were four of these for 1970,
                    1971, 1972, and 1973. They were generally composed in San Clemente, California,
                    at Nixon's vacation White House, but sometimes also in Washington. These were
                    drafted in the December-January time period, with the final product coming out
                    in February. These were really quite remarkable documents. However, almost
                    invariably, when they came out, the only questions at the press conferences when
                    they were released were about Vietnam. The press would ignore rather important
                    stuff on what we were doing with China or with our allies, in the Middle East,
                    or even with Russia. So it was exasperating that the focus would always be on
                    the immediate problem of Vietnam, as opposed to all of the other elegant,
                    conceptual stuff that was in them.</p>
                <p>At some point we'll get into these because, as I went on, I became a speechwriter
                    and then I orchestrated speeches for Kissinger when he was Secretary of State.
                    That, in itself, was an exercise in the agony and ecstasy, but mostly agony.</p>
                <p>So these were my basic roles. Most of my time was spent on Vietnam and China. A
                    lot of time was spent on drafting, but some time was spent on Russia and other
                    issues.</p>
                <p>Q: On these memos and notes that you helped draft for Kissinger to go to Nixon on
                    various issues, was there much paper going back and forth on this? Would Nixon
                    come back to Kissinger? Did he have anybody writing for him?</p>
                <p>LORD: We're talking mostly about either strategy memos before meetings or trips,
                    or reporting memos and analysis afterwards. Certainly, on Vietnam or China, I
                    think that it's fair to say that throughout this period in the White House, I
                    certainly did major reporting on the results of these trips. I want to make
                    clear that I did this, in conjunction with the NSC staff experts. It's fair to
                    say that I had a certain flair for drafting, even though I didn't always have
                    the expertise. I had enough of a sense of the substance, when I got into it,
                    that I could do that. I don't want to exaggerate this, but whether it was on
                    Kissinger's secret trip to China, on which we prepared a 40-page, single space
                    report, or the strategy for upcoming, secret talks on Vietnam, I would certainly
                    do these more or less, in conjunction with others on the staff. In reporting on
                    the results of trips, I would prepare the reports in conjunction with them. It's
                    fair to say that I was a dominant drafter, together and equally with them and
                    increasingly with Peter Rodman, as time went on, on the actual transcripts of
                    these meetings.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>Almost single-handedly I did the drafting, in consultation with others, on the
                    1970 Laos statement, on the 1970 report of the President on Cambodia, and so
                    on.In most cases the feed back was probably verbal from President Nixon, that
                    is, from Nixon to Kissinger. The one example that was different was on the trip
                    to China. We'll get into this in more detail, but Nixon did an extraordinary
                    amount of homework. I was in charge of putting the briefing books together. I
                    think that we had at least six huge briefing books covering every, conceivable
                    issue. The President underlined and wrote comments on almost every page of the
                    six books. He kept asking for more information, even as we flew out to China,
                    stopping on the way in Hawaii and Guam. Even as he was flying into China, he was
                    asking for more information. He really did his homework and performed very well
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we approach this thematically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I was just wondering if I should give you a portrait oKissinger. I don't
                    think we've done that yet...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: And my relationship to him. And then, if you like, we can geinto subjects
                    like China...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: It's hard to sum this up. There is no question that Kissinger is the most
                    brilliant person that I've ever met. I was clearly his closest associate in
                    terms of friendship and, along with Al Haig, in terms of substance, during the
                    White House years. Our relationship was still very close and intensive during
                    the State Department years, but there was a much bigger bureaucracy to deal with
                    in the State Department and a much wider circle of people. On a day to day basis
                    during the State Department years, Larry Eagleburger as executive assistant was
                    more closely involved with Kissinger than I was. I was head of the Policy
                    Planning Staff in the State Department. It's fair to say that at least during
                    the early and middle 1970s, I probably knew Kissinger better than almost anyone
                    else.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>Like anybody who's been close to him, I had some mixed feelings about him. Even
                    in these semi-private discussions I don't want to be disloyal to Kissinger but I
                    would also want to give a valid portrait of him for the sake of history. I want
                    to say from the beginning that I'll always be very grateful to him. This is not
                    just for the record. It's a genuine feeling, in terms of what he did for my
                    career and what he did for my intellect in stretching my mind. He was very good
                    at understanding people's strengths and weaknesses. He drove people very hard.
                    He drove himself very hard, in the pursuit of excellence. However, he wouldn't
                    drive someone if he knew that he couldn't do something.</p>
                <p>For example, he knew that I was a good writer. So he would drive me crazy,
                    improving memos and speech drafts, knowing that I was capable of doing even
                    better than I had done and that I could respond. He would not drive others who,
                    he knew, were not that good as drafting officers. They might have other
                    strengths, but he wouldn't hit them that hard because he knew that they couldn't
                    do it. So he had a very good sense of what people were good at and what they
                    weren't good at.</p>
                <p>Of course, other portraits of Kissinger have been made, and so I won't be adding
                    much in this regard. I would say, even though he would be upset at this, that
                    Walter Isaacson's book, although sometimes unfair in certain parts, gives
                    Kissinger credit for his strengths and points out some of the warts. The book
                    has a very nuanced feel for the strategy and tactics and style of Kissinger.
                    That doesn't mean I agree with all of it. Kissinger critics are often given more
                    space than supporters. There are some books on Kissinger which are total hatchet
                    jobs and are really unfair. Then, there are others which are close to a
                    whitewash of him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isaacson's book is called...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: “Kissinger.” It shows a very sophisticated grasp of substance in terms of
                    what Kissinger was trying to achieve conceptually, strategically, and
                    tactically. In terms of personality and operating style as well I would have to
                    say that it is the best book on Kissinger that I have seen, even though I fully
                    understand why Kissinger was upset about this book. If someone wrote a book
                    about me that was 90 percent favorable and 10 percent critical, I would be upset
                    about the 10 percent. In Isaacson's case, the critical percentage was higher.
                    There is no question about that. There are some aspects where his comments about
                    Kissinger are unfavorable and/or unfair.</p>
                <p>Kissinger had the following strengths. In terms of pure intellect Kissinger was
                    absolutely brilliant. He was a tremendous strategist and conceptual thinker as a
                    geopolitician. He was also a terrific tactician in terms of implementing this
                    strategy. He was a superb negotiator, one who was able to adjust his negotiating
                    style to his interlocutors and their cultural history. He didn't know much about
                    China before he started his negotiations with the Chinese leaders. He didn't
                    know much about Vietnam. He was more of a European expert.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>With the Chinese, and I am oversimplifying this, and their style has changed
                    since then, I might add, their basic approach was first to lay out general
                    principles which they felt strongly about. They would set forth what they really
                    needed from their standpoint and stick quite closely to this to the end. This
                    was in opposition to the Russian negotiating style, which involved inflating
                    their objectives for bargaining purposes. Then they haggled like rug merchants.
                    Or the Israeli style, which reflects their sense of insecurity, understandably
                    because of their history, geography, and so on. The Israelis behave like
                    meticulous lawyers, concentrating on every last detail in negotiating documents.
                    They are almost like Talmudic scholars. Kissinger would go to the Israelis and
                    get 10 requests for agreements that the Israelis wanted him to get out of Anwar
                    Sadat [of Egypt]. Then he would go to Sadat and get agreement on nine of these
                    requests. He would return to the Israelis, and they would complain about the one
                    request that he wasn't able to obtain from Sadat.</p>
                <p>With the Arabs he recognized their emotional quality and Anwar Sadat's heroic
                    courage, and so on. With the Vietnamese he understood that they were
                    revolutionaries and really had no instinct to compromise. They were just using
                    the negotiations in an effort to wear us down.</p>
                <p>So Kissinger had a sense of each of these negotiating styles. He was very good at
                    trying to understand what the other side needed, as well as what we needed. He
                    was very good at mixing sticks and carrots, pressures and incentives. He had a
                    terrific sense of humor, which people don't always realize, which he would
                    introduce at meetings at moments of tension. These would leaven the meeting and
                    would make the other side appreciate him more and help the personal
                    relationship. He was never naive enough to base his negotiating style on
                    personal likes or dislikes. He did this in terms of national self interest.
                    However, around the edges you can build up trust in some cases that help you get
                    through some difficult points.</p>
                <p>Kissinger was extraordinarily good with the press. Journalists genuinely
                    appreciated his conceptual discussions on background, when he would explain
                    policy and strategy. It really was an education for the press.</p>
                <p>From the very beginning of his time in Washington he was extremely effective in
                    bureaucratic infighting. This was all the more impressive since he was a scholar
                    and had never served in government, except occasional consultant. Armed with
                    Mort Halperin's memos, he set up the NSC system and established absolute
                    control, e.g. chairing all the key committees. He would engage the bureaucracies
                    by issuing orders for all kinds of studies to keep them busy.One reason that he
                    was so effective is that he worked extremely hard. Kissinger swallowed up
                    Secretary of State Rogers, partly because President Nixon wanted to run foreign
                    policy out of the White House, partly because Kissinger was a lot smarter and
                    more ruthless than Rogers, but partly because he worked a lot harder. Of course,
                    he assembled an extraordinary staff, to help him. The only staff to rival it in
                    my whole career was the one I assembled as State Department Policy Planning
                    Director (1973-77).</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>He was an extremely fast reader; this would have been an advantage to anybody. He
                    could get through things very quickly. Often, I would prepare speech drafts. I
                    would be upset that he would reject them so quickly, and so I would test to see
                    whether he was really reading them carefully. Once, for example, while we were
                    preparing one of the President's reports, we had a 30 page chapter I prepared on
                    Cambodia. On page 15, right in the middle of a paragraph, as obscurely as I
                    could place it, I constructed a sentence that was perfectly grammatical and
                    which consisted of the title of every book that Kissinger had ever written. I
                    mentioned the troubled partnership, the necessity for choice, and I don't
                    remember what else, but I put it all in there. Sure enough, he read the whole
                    chapter in about two minutes and caught that sentence.</p>
                <p>He needed very little sleep. I would say that he slept roughly four to five hours
                    a night. So, since he often worked for 20 hours a day, read very fast, worked
                    very hard, was brilliant and had a wonderful staff, he got results. Even though
                    he mistreated his staff in many ways, he was very good at assembling a good
                    staff which could magnify his influence. Although he lost many staff members
                    because of the hard work he demanded, his deviousness, and his temper tantrums,
                    he kept the hard core of his staff because he inspired them by what he was doing
                    and what they could participate in. He respected intellectual exchange, so those
                    of us who were tough enough and had enough of a sense of security to go back at
                    him flowered under this system, even though there were times when we would get
                    upset. So for all of these reasons, he was inspiring.</p>
                <p>He was very articulate, sometimes in a ponderous way. When he was working on a
                    speech, he was a very good editor in many ways. As one has seen from his books,
                    he was a very good writer. So these are some of his strengths.</p>
                <p>Of course, his down side is well known. Many of these characteristics he would
                    acknowledge, including his deviousness, in that he would at least bend the truth
                    or say different things to different people. These conflicting statements often
                    caught up with him, including remarks he made to members of the bureaucracy. He
                    himself has admitted his sense of secrecy which President Nixon wanted as well.
                    Nevertheless, it was a rather crazy system in 1969-73 and, indeed, was rather
                    humiliating to people like Secretary of State Rogers, who wasn't included, e.g.
                    in the meeting between Nixon and Mao Zedong. You could lose some knowledge and
                    expertise by not being able to draw on the experts in the bureaucracy. I should
                    add quickly, though, that as he would point out, and has done so with some
                    justification, whatever the secrecy and deviousness of those White House years,
                    there were some major accomplishments. This gets into the question of means and
                    ends, perhaps.</p>
                <p>For example, I don't think that the opening to China could have been accomplished
                    without secrecy. I don't think that the negotiations with Vietnam would have
                    made so much progress toward the end without secrecy. There were other major
                    accomplishments such as the Berlin negotiations and the SALT [Strategic Arms
                    Limitation Talks] agreements with the Russians.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>People can disagree whether these would have been possible without secrecy. I'll
                    give you one example, dealing with China. The secrecy certain cost us in terms
                    of our relations with Japan, and that should have been better handled.</p>
                <p>Q: The Japanese called the announcement of the Kissinger agreement with China,
                    the Nixon Shocku.</p>
                <p>LORD: And Japan is a key ally of the United States. However, if Kissinger's going
                    secretly to China had been known in advance, a number of things would have
                    happened, and these were some of the arguments used for secrecy.</p>
                <p>The Chinese indicated that they wanted some degree of confidentiality as well,
                    but I think that the emphasis on secrecy was certainly as much from our side as
                    theirs. If it had been known in advance that Kissinger was going to China,
                    first, you would have had the Washington bureaucracy weighing in with specific,
                    and, in Kissinger's and Nixon's view, second level concerns, that we had to get
                    this aspect of trade, cultural exchanges, or whatever. Or that we had to be
                    careful about Russian sensitivities. This would have hamstrung the early
                    discussions.</p>
                <p>Secondly, we would have had our allies weighing in, in advance, trying to bind
                    us, whether this involved our South Vietnamese allies, the Japanese, or the
                    Europeans making demands and limiting us in our discussions with the
                    Chinese.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, there would have been a firestorm among the conservatives and many of
                    the Republicans domestically in the U.S. about the President's even considering
                    making this dramatic move toward China, causing an uproar and hamstringing him
                    in advance. All of this would also have put off the Chinese.</p>
                <p>Fourthly, all of this would have been exacerbated by thunderstandable anguish of
                    our friends on Taiwan.</p>
                <p>This can be endlessly debated, and we'll come back to it, but there were at least
                    some plausible arguments for the initial secrecy in connection with the China
                    trip. I might just point that out generally, before I get off track.</p>
                <p>There was no question that Kissinger would lose his temper. Isaacson has put out
                    the theory, which may or may not be true, and I think that there may have been
                    some element of truth in it, that Kissinger treated me better than others. I
                    think that this is true, although I got my share of yelling from Kissinger and
                    on many occasions. No question about that.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>However, I always felt that Kissinger was less outrageous with me than with some
                    others. I don't particularly buy Isaacson's view for the reasons he cites. I
                    think that this is rather a case of psychobabble. There is the fact that I came
                    from an establishment background, my mother was a member of the Pillsbury
                    family, and I came from Park Avenue. Kissinger was an immigrant, looking for
                    greater social status. I think that is a little bit too complicated for me.
                    Moreover, Nelson Rockefeller surely gave him all these elements. Without wishing
                    to sound pompous or self-righteous, I think that Kissinger felt that I had a
                    certain degree of integrity and principle. He respected that and thought that I
                    was less devious, even though he himself was devious on bureaucratic matters. He
                    felt that I was a little more open. He may have seen some contrast in my
                    approaches versus others and was somewhat more hesitant to scream and yell at
                    me. Frankly, I did good, hard work for him which, I am sure, he appreciated. So,
                    although I had my share of mistreatment, it was not as bad as some others
                    suffered. And he generally would come back more gently after some outburst.</p>
                <p>I was put off by the way he would yell and scream at others in front of me or
                    just generally. I was put off by his deviousness, although not so much with me
                    because I knew pretty much everything that was going on. I didn't particularly
                    like the extent of deviousness he displayed with others, which I felt was
                    unnecessary.</p>
                <p>Kissinger and I used to joke that when we studied philosophy, as we did in our
                    younger days, he would study logic, and I would study ethics. As was pointed out
                    in one of his books, which he gave me for Christmas, an Andrew Wyeth set of
                    paintings, he inscribed it to my “conscience,” or being his conscience.So
                    Kissinger and I had a complicated relationship. There is no question that, on a
                    personal level, he had high regard for me and my wife, whom he greatly admired,
                    as he liked strong women. My wife is charming and is strong and smart. She
                    talked back to him as well and gave him good advice on China. We were his
                    closest social friends on his staff. He generally didn't socialize too much with
                    people on his staff and never got close to people like Al Haig, for example.
                    Whether at dinner parties, just alone, or at a Chinese restaurant, or whatever
                    the occasion, he saw quite a bit of us. We were one of a small handful invited
                    to his wedding to Nancy. Later on, after Kissinger married Nancy, we saw a good
                    bit of her as well. So it was a good, close relationship.</p>
                <p>Of course, there were times when I got mad at him. There were weeks when I would
                    come home, screaming only half in jest that I was ready to quit. My wife would
                    always say: “Knock it off and go back to work.” At the time of the Cambodian
                    invasion [in 1970] I was very close to quitting, and we'll get back to that. So
                    I did have some mixed feelings about Kissinger. I would get impatient at the
                    hard work and the constant demands and the deviousness in his treatment of other
                    people. However, at the same time, nobody is perfect, everyone has faults, he
                    was under tremendous pressure, he was working harder than anyone else, he was
                    brilliant, and he was doing, on the whole, things that I thought were very
                    important and constructive. Therefore, you tend to get into the whole question
                    of means and ends.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>So I clearly saw Kissinger's warts. Without being condescending, because I have
                    my own faults, I felt that he was someone who was doing very important things. I
                    felt that you had to forgive people, particularly those under pressure, for
                    certain faults. He was an incredible mix of ego and insecurity. On the one hand,
                    he was extremely self-confident, willing to take on all of these negotiations,
                    juggle a lot of balls at once, go off on trips, and do all of these things with
                    a small staff. He had to have an incredible ego to do all of that.
                    Intellectually, he knew how dominant he was.</p>
                <p>However, at the same time he was insecure. He was insecure in terms of President
                    Nixon and the Haldeman crowd, whether they really distrusted him or not. He was
                    insecure in that he did not want people to have direct access to Nixon. We will
                    discuss the phone tapping episode. That clearly was evidence of Kissinger's
                    being in the twilight zone on some of these issues.</p>
                <p>He had a tremendous sense of humor, which also was a saving grace. There were
                    constant examples of that. He was self-deprecating. Often Bill Hyland, Peter
                    Rodman, and I would send false memos to him. For example, we once prepared a
                    memo from Kissinger to Nixon suggesting, somewhat irreverently, a meeting with
                    God. We talked about 12 people being present. Supper would be served. A
                    ten-point plan, and so forth. We prepared phony communiques for Guatemala and
                    for Ethiopia in which we would do parodies of meetings just concluded.</p>
                <p>I once gave him a picture of a big gorilla, inscribed to me from him, saying:
                    “When I want your opinion, I'll beat it out of you,” and that kind of thing. I'm
                    not giving very good examples here, but the point is that this leavened things
                    up and made working for him worthwhile. During meetings, sometimes tense ones,
                    or after them, we would often swap humorous asides.</p>
                <p>As he came from Europe, he had a sense of history and tragedy. In looking at the
                    course of events he never had the American sense of optimism. He always had a
                    feeling that things might go wrong. He was greatly concerned with stability and
                    geopolitics. On the one hand, this was an advantage, because he had a sense, as
                    the Europeans did, and as an historian, of the balance of power. This served him
                    well in dealing with China, Russia, Vietnam, and the Middle East. So he had a
                    strong, conceptual and historical background which served him well and worked
                    well with Nixon.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, it was a weakness because it meant less concern about human
                    rights and values. This got him into trouble with the right and the left, for
                    example, in connection with the search for detente with the Soviet Union. On
                    human rights generally, he never had a full appreciation of the need for public
                    and Congressional support, which might come more naturally to people born in the
                    United States. In many ways he was more comfortable dealing with authoritarian
                    leaders who could make decisions than in dealing with messy democracies and
                    parliaments. And he did not fully appreciate, in my view that democracies
                    elsewhere helps on national security goals</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>On the plus side again, I have to say that he got the best out of his staff. I
                    think I have mentioned that he really stretched me. I learned from him an
                    incredible amount of history, conceptual approaches, and geopolitics, as well as
                    negotiating skills and skill in dealing with the press and the bureaucracy. I
                    will always be grateful to him for that.</p>
                <p>I might add, in passing, that any stories about his being a secreswinger and a
                    ladies' man are totally made up, or exaggerated.</p>
                <p>I should also point out, on the plus side, that he was a very steady friend.
                    There would be times when he would yell at me and so forth. However, there were
                    times, in the crunch, when he stood by me. A good example, and we'll get to this
                    later, is that my first assignment as a Special Assistant in 1970was to prepare
                    a long, White Paper on our historical involvement in Laos. Through misleading
                    reports by one agency or another and for other reasons, a mistake, or an alleged
                    mistake, was contained in that White Paper. There was a phrase in that paper
                    that no American had ever been killed in combat in Laos over the previous 20
                    years or so. There was a lot of controversy about how much we had been involved
                    in Laos secretly. This paper was designed to clearthe record. In fact, we didn't
                    have combat soldiers getting killed in Laos. We had people who went into and out
                    of Laos. One group was ambushed and, in self defense, a few had been killed.
                    This was not really combat. So literally the statement we made was true but, of
                    course, it was somewhat misleading. Given the suspicions about our Laos
                    involvement, the statement that in this 20 year period only six or so Americans
                    had been killed, and it wasn't really combat, people could have said: “that's a
                    lot less than we suspected.” However, on the day this paper was published, this
                    secret was revealed, so to speak, and made it look as if we were being devious.
                    It was hugely inflated - why would we cover up such a small number? But the
                    agencies misled me in providing information.</p>
                <p>Anyway, it was a horrible introduction to being a Special Assistant to Kissinger.
                    The press went crazy, and the White House faced a barrage of questions, day
                    after day. President Nixon was furious at Kissinger and his staff for screwing
                    this up. Throughout that period Kissinger was rock solid personally with me and
                    for me. He said: “It was not your fault. You were just misled by the
                    bureaucracy,” which was basically true, by the way. Secondly, while he said this
                    to President Nixon in my defense, it would have been very easy for Kissinger to
                    have laid the responsibility for this statement on me. He basically said: “Look,
                    we should have double checked this around. That's my fault.” That is, it was
                    Kissinger's fault, not the fault of his staff. It was a very tough moment for
                    me. I hadn't worked for him for that long. I was new to the West Wing and a
                    brand new Special Assistant, so it wasn't as if he owed me for years of hard
                    work. He stuck by me solidly.</p>

                <p>Another good example of his being a good friend, although it was also in his own
                    self-interest, was when Zhou En-lai invited President Nixon to meet with Mao
                    Zedong and said that Kissinger should come along. Kissinger then asked me to
                    come along as well. This was partly so that he wouldn't have to take notes,
                    leaving this task to me. However, in all fairness I had basically done the
                    hardest work on the China visit from the beginning. I had been responsible for
                    overseeing the briefing books. It was obviously an historic moment, and
                    Kissinger included me in on that meeting with Mao, for which I'll always be
                    grateful.</p>
                <p>Also, he has been generous to me in his books in referring to my contributions
                    and my character, as well as in paying tribute to me in public forums.</p>
                <p>The down side is that I know that in more recent years there have been times when
                    he has bad mouthed me for some of the policies that I have been involved in. As
                    always, this was not stated publicly, but you always hear about it.</p>
                <p>There was the wire tapping episode. We can get into that later on, if you like.
                    However, briefly, his argument was that there were serious leaks in our
                    international security structure, and he was right. As I said earlier, my belief
                    is that if you have a disagreement on policy, you should debate it and generally
                    try to force a policy change. If you lose out on that debate, either you carry
                    the policy out loyally and don't leak, or you quit your job, if it's that
                    fundamental an issue. I was always against leaks. I never leaked, in fact.
                    During that period I was very shy with the press because I knew that I could get
                    into trouble, but also because that was my style. Kissinger, in effect, was
                    saying that these were damaging leaks, and Nixon, Haldeman, and others were
                    suspicious of this liberal staff, anyway. They knew that some of these leaks had
                    to come from a very small circle because the information was so sensitive, and
                    only a few people knew about it.</p>
                <p>Therefore, Kissinger said he couldn't say that they could wire tap others but
                    that they couldn't wire tap his staff. He was assured by Attorney General
                    Mitchell and others that the wire tapping was perfectly legal. Kissinger
                    genuinely was concerned about the leaking. A good example of one of these leaks
                    is that just before the secret trip to China, the Pentagon Papers were
                    published, based on selected, secret documents. Daniel Ellsberg, who had been a
                    Pentagon official, put them out without authorization. If anything, these papers
                    were damaging to the Johnson administration, not to the Nixon administration. On
                    purely political grounds you could say that the publication of these papers was
                    all to Nixon's advantage, since they dealt with the Johnson era. However, Nixon
                    and Kissinger went through the roof on the principle that you don't leak these
                    highly classified documents. They were also concerned that the Chinese, who
                    wanted confidentiality in dealings with the U.S. at that point, would feel that
                    the U.S. Government couldn't keep any secrets. So this was Kissinger's reasoning
                    on the wiretapping episode.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>Having said that, I would have to add that you cannot square a personal
                    friendship and total trust and intimacy with his authorizing of tapping your
                    phone, as you go along. I am sure that many people felt, and I can understand
                    that, that my sense of outrage was too much under control. I was unhappy with
                    the wiretapping and I said so. I also thought that it was an ineffective way to
                    run down leakers. However, I understood some of the rationale for it. I myself
                    thought that the leaks were unfortunate, even when they involved leaking
                    material to pursue some policy option that I agreed with. I just think that that
                    isn't the way to operate. You can't run a government that way. I understood that
                    I had access to all of the most sensitive information, so that only a few people
                    could be suspected. I would naturally be one of them, because I knew virtually
                    everything. Very few people in that secretive White House knew everything in
                    terms of secret negotiations and policies.</p>
                <p>It turned out that I didn't know that my phone was being tapped until just before
                    I was about to leave the White House staff in May, 1973. I wanted to take a
                    break because of total exhaustion and wanting to see more of my family and my
                    kids grow up. The Vietnam War was over, we had opened up to China, we had a
                    degree of det�nte with the Russians, and it seemed a good time to leave. I
                    learned about the phone tapping when I had already decided to leave, and I had
                    an exchange about it with Kissinger.</p>
                <p>So that is some of the down side of my experience with him.</p>
                <p>Kissinger, of course, was very disorganized in many ways. He didn't have a clean
                    management style but, nevertheless, got things done. I don't think that I have
                    anything else to raise at this time, but we may pick up other things as we go
                    along. That is pretty much my recollection of this period.</p>
                <p>I want to leave it on a positive note, both in terms of my personal gratitude and
                    my admiration for Kissinger's achievements, his hard work, his brilliance, and
                    his essential patriotism in trying to serve the United States. I'll always be
                    grateful to him and I have affection as well as respect for him. This doesn't
                    mean that there weren't times when I was exasperated or that there were not
                    elements of Kissinger's character that I didn't and don't fully approve of.
                    However, nobody is perfect.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we move to cover the China trip, what about Alexander Haig? I was
                    wondering if you could talk about his role at this time, because he became a
                    major figure later on.</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, Haig rose amazingly fast in the federal bureaucracy. He was
                    recommended by Secretary of Defense McNamara and maybe some other people to
                    Kissinger, who wanted a Military Assistant. He came to the NSC staff as a
                    Colonel with the task of maintaining liaison with the Pentagon and as a Military
                    Assistant to Kissinger. At the time he was no more important than about 15
                    others on the NSC staff, in terms of either rank or access.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>There was fierce competition to see who would be Kissinger's deputy in the early
                    months of the Nixon administration. The major contenders were Mort Halperin, who
                    left partly because of Kissinger's duplicity on various matters and partly
                    because he didn't get to be Deputy National Security Adviser. Another contender
                    was Hal Sonnenfeldt, who had complicated relations with Kissinger. Both were
                    immigrants from Germany. Sonnenfeldt was very smart but was always poking around
                    and making Kissinger nervous. So there was a love-hate relations between the two
                    of them. To a certain extent Larry Lynn was also a contender. He was an
                    assistant to Kissinger from the Defense Department. He did a lot of analytical
                    work, systems analysis work on defense, Vietnam, etc.</p>
                <p>Of course, none of these people became Kissinger's deputy. Al Haig became Deputy
                    National Security Adviser, which was quite an extraordinary achievement for
                    someone who didn't even know Kissinger and who had rather obscure beginnings. He
                    worked his way up, finally becoming Kissinger's deputy. He managed this partly
                    because he was a very hard worker, loyal, and tough. He was willing to take on
                    tough issues for Kissinger. It has also been surmised, by Isaacson and others,
                    that Kissinger felt that Haig would not be much of a challenge intellectually,
                    compared to Halperin, Sonnenfeldt, and so on. I think that Kissinger felt that
                    Haig would be a deputy who could do some tough work on his behalf and make the
                    trains run on time. I think that Kissinger felt that he wouldn't always have to
                    be looking over his shoulder at Haig, although that was rather ironic, given
                    their complicated relationship with President Nixon later on.</p>
                <p>No matter how you look at it, though, Haig emerged as Kissinger's deputy. He
                    managed to do it, certainly in the early days of the Nixon administration,
                    without alienating the rest of the NSC staff. I mean that he not only reached
                    that position but he did so without leaving a lot of bloody bodies behind him.
                    He sort of did this smoothly. I can't speak for others about their views of Haig
                    at the time. However, I have the impression that, at least in the early going,
                    he was respected and managed to become Deputy National Security Adviser without
                    alienating a lot of people. That was quite an extraordinary achievement.</p>
                <p>Now, Al Haig had many strong qualities. No question that he was courageous. He
                    would talk back to Kissinger, which was always important. He was willing to
                    undertake tough assignments, whether this involved giving the bureaucracy bad
                    news or going out to Saigon and trying to persuade President Nguyen van Thieu
                    and the South Vietnamese Government to go along with the Vietnam Agreement of
                    January, 1973. Or going to China in January, 1972, after our secret trip in
                    October, 1971, to help to prepare the final logistics and some of the other
                    details for the subsequent trip by President Nixon. So Haig was someone whom
                    Kissinger could count on to do tough work. He handled some of these assignments
                    very well. He was always outspoken and a very hard worker. He was a genuine
                    patriot, whatever one thinks of all his subsequent views and actions.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>As some suspected, Haig would often play good guy with the NSC staff, in
                    distinction from Mad Man Kissinger. He would sometimes be friendly to the NSC
                    staff and say: “I'm on your side. We've got to keep Kissinger under control.” I
                    wouldn't put too much emphasis on that, but that was the view of some members of
                    the NSC staff.</p>
                <p>On the whole, Haig was more hawkish, if you can put it that way, more suspicious
                    of the North Vietnamese, and more grudging about the Vietnam Peace Accord of
                    January, 1973, although he went along with it. Generally, Haig was on the side
                    of more military pressure in Vietnam, if necessary. He was somewhat more
                    suspicious on how to deal with the Russians. I don't want to suggest any major
                    divergences from established policy. Certainly, he was in full agreement on
                    China. There were no significant differences there. Haig deserves a lot of
                    credit for taking on tough assignments and working very hard. He would cover
                    effectively for Kissinger when he went on secret trips in connection with
                    Vietnam or China. He was very effective in helping to cover up when we were gone
                    from Washington. So he brought many strengths to the job.</p>
                <p>He, of course, didn't lack for his own deviousness at times, which played in with
                    Kissinger's style as well. As time went on he more and more gained the
                    confidence of President Nixon for, as we were traveling, he would be the Acting
                    National Security Adviser to the President. He appealed to some of Nixon's more
                    hawkish qualities, his suspicion of the bureaucracy, and so on. He gave Nixon
                    some sense that, perhaps, Kissinger wasn't being tough enough on the Russians or
                    with respect to pressuring Hanoi; or he was being too anxious for a deal with
                    the North Vietnamese. As time went on, Kissinger felt that Haig was playing on
                    some of these issues and trying to gain President Nixon's confidence at
                    Kissinger's expense. I think that there was some evidence for that. The
                    relationship between Kissinger and Haig became very complicated. This is well
                    documented in Isaacson's book and in Kissinger's memoirs.</p>
                <p>The most classic example is the effort to try to sell the Vietnam agreement,
                    which we had worked out in October, 1972, to President Thieu of South Vietnam.
                    We went to Saigon after the breakthrough in Paris. Thieu was giving us trouble
                    on that. Kissinger and I kept writing cables back to President Nixon and getting
                    tough cables back in return. Kissinger always felt that Haig was influencing
                    these cables, not always showing all of Kissinger's messages to the President.
                    In the home stretch of the Vietnam negotiations after that, there were some
                    unpleasant articles in conservative columns which took cracks at Kissinger. He
                    always felt that that might have been Haig's influence back in Washington. I'm
                    not saying whether these feelings were correct or not, but they did reflect the
                    rather complicated relationship that Kissinger and Haig had.</p>
                <p>There was mutual respect between them. Haig saw all of the strengths of Kissinger
                    that I have enumerated and particularly admired him for those. However, Haig
                    didn't lack for ambition himself. Kissinger saw the value of Haig and leaned on
                    him very heavily, typically in connection with some of the tough work that was
                    needed.VI. NSC - CHINA. OPENING AND KISSINGESECRET TRIP (1969-1971)</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There are three, major themes now: China, Vietnam, and the
                        SovieUnion. Why don't we take the China theme now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you have a wife who was born in China, although China
                        was noyour particular field. Although you were working...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Certainly, the single most dramatic event that I've been involved in had to
                    do with the opening to China in the early 1970s. In my entire career the
                    question of relations with China has been the most important, including not only
                    the work I did in the 1970s but also as Ambassador to China and Assistant
                    Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs. So China has been the single, most
                    important aspect of my career as it has evolved.</p>
                <p>It's been given a special dimension by being married to a woman born in Shanghai
                    who, I think, understands China better than anybody that I know. She has always
                    been very prescient on that, although we haven't always agreed on every last
                    policy prescription.</p>
                <p>There is some irony about the centrality of China in my career, because I was a
                    Foreign Service Officer in 1962, when my wife and I decided to get married. In
                    those days you had to get permission to marry a foreign citizen. Not just
                    because she was Chinese. She could have been Irish or, say, Congolese. I would
                    still have had to get permission to marry her. The State Department gave this
                    permission, but they said that I would never work on Chinese affairs. This was
                    because many of her relatives were still in China, with the exception of her
                    mother and father and second sister. (Her third sister was still in China at the
                    time.) Her father worked for the Taiwan Sugar Company, which is
                    government-owned, so he was close to being a diplomatic representative of Taiwan
                    in the United States. In fact, he represented Taiwan in the international sugar
                    negotiations. So the State Department said that this combination, and my having
                    a Chinese wife, meant that I would never work on Chinese affairs. I, of course,
                    said that I could find other issues to work on but couldn't find another woman
                    like this, so I would go ahead, with this restriction.</p>
                <p>Partly for that reason I never studied Chinese in the State Department. I might
                    never have studied Chinese anyway, given the pressure of time. My wife didn't
                    have the patience to try to teach me Chinese. So I never learned to speak
                    Chinese and never thought that I was going to work on China. Of course, I ended
                    up going with Kissinger on his secret trip to China and was the central support
                    mechanism for Nixon and Kissinger on China throughout that period.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>Then, I wound up being American Ambassador to China. So, to my dismay, I didn't
                    speak Chinese when I went to China as Ambassador. I took lessons, but you can't
                    learn Chinese on the basis of an hour a day. There is some irony in all of this,
                    but China has been a special part of my career and my personal life, for the
                    reasons I have mentioned.</p>
                <p>One amusing footnote which I might mention, in retrospect, is that my wife was
                    interviewed in the course of my obtaining permission to marry her. In one sense,
                    this interview was outrageous. She was interviewed by someone who was about a
                    mid-level GS civil servant, named Mr. Szluc, I believe. I had accompanied her to
                    the State Department, but Mr. Szluc sent me away and said that the interview was
                    going to take some time. In fact, it lasted for about two hours. He asked her a
                    series of incredible questions which you wouldn't expect native-born Americans
                    to be able to answer, let alone someone born in China. She was not a recent
                    immigrant but had come to the United States at the age of eight. In this
                    interview she was asked to name the starting lineup of the Green Bay Packers
                    football team, who is Vardis Fisher, what's a “Death in the Afternoon” cocktail,
                    what's the difference between a minuet and a pavane, and name the original 13
                    colonies in the order in which they became part of the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I couldn't have answered any of those questions!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No, and neither could I. I don't know how many she could answer, but I
                    always told her that Mr. Szluc was just having fun. She had a master's degree
                    from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, not to mention an undergraduate
                    degree from Tufts University. In addition to her academic training she is very
                    smart, so obviously the interviewer was just having some fun. He asked the
                    questions very seriously. If she didn't have self-confidence and ego, this
                    process could really have upset her. At the beginning and at the end of the
                    interview he said: “I have the power to deny your application for marriage.” He
                    said that with a straight face. On the last question he said: “This is the most
                    important one of all, more important than any other that I have asked so far.
                    What will you do if I tell you that this application for marriage is to be
                    turned down and that your husband cannot remain in the Foreign Service?” She
                    said: “Well, that's very clear. He can get another job but he can't find another
                    person like me to marry.” That's what I would have said. So the marriage was
                    approved. It's amusing in retrospect but, in many ways, it was quite
                    outrageous.</p>
                <p>Q: I wanted to say that, as a Foreign Service Officer, I never dealt with China.
                    I entered the Foreign Service in 1955 and always had the feeling: “Damn it. It
                    doesn't make any sense not to have diplomatic relations with China.” No doubt
                    there were reasons, but I just wondered if you were carrying any particular
                    intellectual baggage with you in this respect?</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>LORD: Well, as I've already discussed, in the early part of my career in the
                    State Department I worked on Congressional Relations, political-military
                    affairs, and trade matters. When I went over to the Pentagon, I began to work
                    more on Asia and, of course, thought somewhat about China. I have to say that,
                    as I came onto the NSC staff, I certainly was not like Senator Joe McCarthy or
                    Congressman Walter Judd on China. I was not hysterical about this matter. But I
                    also have to say that I wasn't champing at the bit to have a brand new,
                    revolutionary policy toward China.</p>
                <p>I was rather open minded. I felt that Mao's Communist China was a pretty
                    unpleasant place and had been pretty unfriendly to the U.S. I was certainly
                    receptive to trying to improve relations, but I was sort of in the middle. I
                    certainly wasn't dug in as a hard right, anti-communist. However, I wasn't one
                    who said that we were absolutely crazy about our policy toward China. I didn't
                    ask why we weren't dealing with the population of 800 million people at the
                    time. So I wasn't a real revolutionary then. It's hard to remember what I felt.
                    I'm sure that I read Nixon's own foreign policy piece in “Foreign Affairs”
                    magazine in 1967, which included the need to deal with China. I think that I was
                    receptive to moving toward China and I saw geopolitical advantages to doing
                    that.</p>
                <p>I think that it's fair to say that American analysts, and there might have been
                    some exceptions, on the whole were quite slow to see the Sino-Soviet split. As
                    we look back on it, the Chinese and the Soviets were going through real
                    tensions, certainly by the early 1960s. By the time I joined the NSC staff in
                    the late 1960s to work on Asia, I understood that there were tensions between
                    Moscow and China. I don't think that, even then, we saw how profound they were.
                    We were not under the illusion that the Sino-Soviet bloc was a monolith. Indeed,
                    I am sure that I understood instinctively that what President Nixon and
                    Kissinger intended to do was to attempt some exploitation of the tensions
                    between the two communist states. I would have to say that I didn't appreciate
                    fully the extent of the divisions between Russia and China, even in the late
                    1960s. The border clashes along the Sino-Soviet border were a dramatic event, of
                    course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Along the Ussuri River...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Along the Ussuri River, in the summer of 1969. That, obviously, brought
                    home the reality of this split. Once we began dealing with the Chinese and with
                    the Russians, you could see that there was tremendous tension, so it was very
                    clear, of course, by the early 1970s. I would say that I was very slow in coming
                    to realize this, as most people were. I was not naive about a monolithic
                    approach to the two countries, of course, but I didn't realize the full depth of
                    their hostility toward each other.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>Nixon and Kissinger each came into office placing a high priority on making an
                    opening to China. They had independently come to this conclusion. Nixon had
                    indicated this in his article in “Foreign Affairs.” We know, in retrospect, that
                    he felt that this was a high priority. Kissinger felt the same way, primarily
                    because of the Soviet dimension, but for a variety of other reasons.</p>
                <p>Kissinger's rationale, and Nixon's, included the following. First, an opening to
                    China would give us more flexibility on the world scene generally. We wouldn't
                    just be dealing with Moscow. We could deal with Eastern Europe, of course, and
                    we could deal with China, because the former Communist Bloc was no longer a
                    bloc. Kissinger wanted more flexibility, generally. Secondly, by opening
                    relations with China we would catch Russia's attention and get more leverage on
                    them through playing this obvious, China card. The idea would be to improve
                    relations with Moscow, hoping to stir a little bit of its paranoia by dealing
                    with China. Never getting so engaged with China that we would turn Russia into a
                    hostile enemy but enough to get the attention of the Russians. We'll come back
                    to that. This effort, in fact, worked dramatically after Kissinger's secret trip
                    to China.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, Kissinger and Nixon wanted to get help in resolving the Vietnam War. By
                    dealing with Russia and with China we hoped to put pressure on Hanoi to
                    negotiate seriously. At a maximum, we tried to get Russia and China to slow down
                    the provision of aid to North Vietnam somewhat. More realistically and at a
                    minimum, we sought to persuade Russia and China to encourage Hanoi to make a
                    deal with the United States and give Hanoi a sense of isolation because their
                    two, big patrons were dealing with us. Indeed, by their willingness to engage in
                    summit meetings with us, with Nixon going to China in February, 1972, and to
                    Moscow in May, 1972, the Russians and Chinese were beginning to place a higher
                    priority on their bilateral relations with us than on their dealings with their
                    friends in Hanoi. This might begin to make Hanoi nervous.</p>
                <p>Much less important for Nixon and Kissinger but a longer range consideration was
                    the potential of economic relations with China. This was less important over the
                    near term, but they saw this in long term dimensions, unlike most American
                    policy makers. They could see a day when China could be an important economic
                    partner of the United States, as well as in terms of cultural exchanges and some
                    other aspects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These aspects were more or less spelled out in
                        conversations...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: In conversations, memos, strategies, and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of this was laid on the table.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes. This is not just retrospective recollection. This was clearly laid on
                    the table. We also wanted to promote general stability in Asia as well. We had
                    fought a war with China in Korea. There was the problem of North Korea. We
                    thought that generally if we wanted to see a more stable region in East Asia, we
                    would have to deal with China.</p>
                <p>These were some of the main reasons for opening up relations with China. Nixon
                    and Kissinger each, and independently, had these reasons on their agenda and, of
                    course, they reinforced each other.</p>
                <p>Nixon sent Kissinger a memo on February 1, 1969, approximately one week after his
                    inauguration as President. I can't reconstruct this memo verbatim, but basically
                    he instructed Kissinger to find a way to get in touch with the Chinese. This was
                    one of the earliest instructions that Kissinger got from Nixon. Of course,
                    Kissinger was all in favor of doing this.</p>
                <p>We had the following challenge, among a lot of other challenges. You have to
                    remember that we had had 20 years of mutual hostility and just about total
                    isolation from China. We had no way of communicating directly with the Chinese.
                    A lot of Americans were still very suspicious of China, even of an anti-Russian
                    China, including a hard core of Nixon's conservative base. The American public
                    really wasn't attuned to an opening to China as yet, although there were
                    different attitudes on this possibility. We had allies who would be nervous
                    about such an opening to China.</p>
                <p>So there were many challenges facing us: how would we get in touch with the
                    Chinese and how would we move, when we knew that they would always put the
                    status of Taiwan up front as the dominant issue? There had been some sporadic
                    talks with the Chinese Communists in Geneva and Warsaw, going back to 1955, but
                    Taiwan, as well as other things, had always been the hang up to an improvement
                    in relations. So the question was: how would we get in touch with the Chinese
                    and how would we move past the Taiwan issue? How would we prepare our allies and
                    the American public for this, particularly the conservatives?</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>So with all of the obvious advantages that Nixon and Kissinger saw, there were
                    these challenges in the way. Here's the way Nixon and Kissinger went about it.
                    First, in terms of communications, the only way to get in touch with the Chinese
                    was through third parties. I don't have all of the details at hand, although
                    they are available elsewhere. There were various channels that Nixon and
                    Kissinger tried to use to get word to the Chinese. In a general sense, they were
                    looking for a new beginning. One involved using De Gaulle and the French,
                    another was Romania, and we finally, of course, settled on Pakistan.So we began
                    with indirect negotiations and communications. These warmed up, and we'll come
                    back to that later on. We finally settled, as I say, on the Pakistani channel.
                    Pakistan had the advantage of being a friend to both sides. There was no danger
                    of Russian involvement, as we might have had if we had used Romania. France was
                    a NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] ally of the U.S. and not necessarily
                    the best channel to use to contact China. So, for a variety of reasons we
                    settled on Pakistan. That was one challenge, namely, getting in touch with the
                    Chinese, which we worked out over a couple of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May I interrupt? Why Pakistan? The British had had
                        uninterrupterelations with China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: First of all, we would have been willing to use any of these channels.
                    However, it was clear that the Chinese weren't picking up on any of them until
                    we got to Pakistan. The British, of course, because of the Opium War [1839-1842]
                    and their history with China would have been a bad channel for the Chinese. The
                    Chinese didn't pick up on the British. If they had picked up with France, I
                    think that we might have continued with the French. The Chinese also didn't pick
                    up on the feeler through Romania. There might have been a couple of other
                    intermediaries which Nixon and Kissinger tried out, but those were the main
                    ones.</p>
                <p>Also, under the general heading of communicating with China, another way that we
                    communicated with China was through taking some unilateral steps at home, by
                    relaxing some economic restrictions. This course did not require reciprocity on
                    their part but was designed to show that we were interested in moving ahead. It
                    was also designed to begin to condition our public and our allies that we were
                    moving ahead in this direction. So several things were done. There was a toast
                    which Nixon gave to President Ceausescu of Romania, in which Nixon used the
                    phrase, the People's Republic of China. This sounds unexceptionable now, but at
                    the time no American official and certainly no President ever used that official
                    designation, which the Chinese Communists wanted. We had always said Red China,
                    Communist China, Mainland China, or something like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>Even then we knew that the Chinese were very subtle. The Chinese would take
                    aboard our just using that phrase, the People's Republic of China. I remember
                    that at one point Secretary of State Rogers gave a speech in Australia which
                    contained some positive signals to China. We selectively relaxed some Treasury
                    restrictions and some travel restrictions, I believe, for travelers, academics,
                    and perhaps humanitarian representatives. I don't have the details of this but
                    I'm sure that they are in Kissinger's book. We also ended our regular naval
                    patrols in the Taiwan Strait itself, cut them back at least.</p>
                <p>The Chinese, in turn, quietly let go free the American yachtsman who had drifted
                    into Chinese waters. Previously they would have made loud noises.</p>
                <p>In effect, we signaled the Chinese, in concrete terms, that we were taking
                    certain steps, however modest, and that we wanted to move toward a new beginning
                    with them. These steps were modest enough, and enough in our interest, that we
                    didn't require reciprocity. We didn't want to start to do something which they
                    would have to respond to, tit for tat. We wanted to signal to them, even as we
                    tried to get in touch with them through these indirect channels and messages of
                    a private nature, through these unilateral steps where we wanted to go.</p>
                <p>Finally, in the President's annual reports on our foreign relations of 1970 and
                    1971 we put language on China in them which would suggest to any careful reader
                    that we were moving toward a new kind of relationship with China. By the time
                    the report for 1972 was prepared, this point was quite obvious. So that was
                    designed, not only to send a signal to China and other countries but also to
                    condition our public opinion, which was the other problem, that we were moving
                    toward China. Obviously, all of this, in retrospect, may be clearer than it was
                    at the time. Despite all of these signals nobody was prepared for Kissinger's
                    secret trip to China. A close observer, looking at President Nixon's toasts and
                    statements, statements made by Secretary of State Rogers, as well as the
                    unilateral steps, would surely have seen our tendency, and our goals, but I
                    don't think that anybody could have predicted the dramatic step of Kissinger's
                    secret trip to China and the Nixon trip. However, the fact that we were trying
                    to move toward a better relationship with China was pretty clear.</p>
                <p>The clashes along the Sino-Soviet border in 1969 underlined the urgency of doing
                    this. We saw the clear evidence of tensions between the two countries.
                    Obviously, China's security concerns on that border, vis-a-vis the Russians,
                    ensured that they would be particularly receptive. I don't have the exact
                    chronology of these various moves but I'm sure that we stepped up our efforts
                    after the border clashes.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there also a feeling that things had reached such a point in China that we
                    might be able to open up relations with that country? This is your field, but
                    there had been this tremendous Cultural Revolution, its offshoot in terms of the
                    Gang of Four, and all of that. China really didn't seem to be ripe for an
                    improvement in our relations.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>LORD: I want to be careful here that I don't retrospectively put perceptions and
                    views in place which are now clear to me and say that we held these views at the
                    time. What was clear, of course, was that China, because of the Soviet threat,
                    might well be interested in improving relations with us. The Soviet Union was
                    clearly their biggest security threat, and the border clashes had made that
                    clear. We sensed that already before then, and then those border clashes brought
                    it home. So, in that sense, we figured that China would be receptive to these
                    overtures, and for the same reasons that we were. The Soviet factor applied to
                    both countries, in addition to more esoteric things, like dealing with the
                    strongest power in the world, security considerations, and so on.</p>
                <p>In addition, the proclamation of the Brezhnev Doctrine in 1968, after the Soviets
                    put down the Prague Spring, Czech dissent, had a major impact on the Chinese.
                    Naturally they were very concerned about Moscow's asserting the right to
                    intervene in other country's domestic affairs for the sake of socialist
                    solidarity.</p>
                <p>You have to remember that, although the most extreme manifestations of the
                    Cultural Revolution were in the late 1960s, it really went on, officially, until
                    the end of 1976. So the Chinese were still sorting this out at the time. In
                    addition to the Soviet factor we also thought that the Chinese might think that,
                    if they could improve relations with us, that might open the door to relations
                    with other countries. Japan was certainly holding back on its opening to China.
                    The French had made some movement toward China, but the British and others, such
                    as the Federal Republic of Germany, were generally holding back in developing
                    relations with China because of the U.S. posture, whether this involved
                    admission of Communist China into the UN or just generally dealing with it. We
                    figured that the Chinese would calculate that if they could open the door with
                    us, that would mean that they could break out of their isolation more generally
                    with all of these other countries. Not to mention getting into the United
                    Nations and beginning to establish at least unofficial, if not official,
                    relationships and breaking out of various kinds of embargoes and isolation with
                    Europe, Japan, and elsewhere. So we figured that that would be another incentive
                    for them which would have multiplier effect if they opened up with us.</p>
                <p>I think that we had some sense that China must have felt somewhat beleaguered at
                    this time. You may remember that the Chinese Government recalled all of its
                    ambassadors during the Cultural Revolution, except for Huang Hua, who was
                    Ambassador to Egypt. So they were isolated. However, frankly, we didn't know
                    much about what was going on in China, as far as the full depth of the Cultural
                    Revolution. We couldn't be sure at the beginning of our effort to establish
                    better relations with China that Mao Zedong and Zhou En-lai would have the
                    vision and courage to open up with us. However, the Russian factor and the
                    perceived Chinese need to break out of their isolation more generally by opening
                    up with us were two of the reasons why, we felt, they would be receptive to our
                    efforts.</p>

                <p>Q: These are all oral histories, and we are focusing on the perceptions of the
                    individuals interviewed. You had been doing more general work for Kissinger. How
                    were you clued in on the policy at that point?</p>
                <p>LORD: During my first year on the NSC staff, from February, 1969, until February,
                    1970, I was not aware of the fact that we were doing private things to establish
                    contact with China. We took some unilateral steps, as I have already mentioned.
                    When I say that I was not aware that we were trying to establish contact with
                    China, let me make it clear that I was not aware that we were trying to pass
                    secret messages to the Chinese. I was aware of some of these unilateral steps
                    because they started in 1969. These involved action taken by the Department of
                    the Treasury and the Department of Commerce, maybe USTR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the travel restrictions. Had the ping pong
                        diplomacbusiness started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No, that was later, in April, 1971, and we'll get back to that. It happened
                    just before Kissinger's secret trip to China. When I became Special Assistant in
                    February 1970, I was aware of the fact that we were searching for a new
                    relationship with China. We were easing these unilateral restrictions, and I
                    learned that we were starting to send some signals to China. I sat in on some of
                    the discussions about what to do during the Sino-Soviet clashes along the Ussuri
                    River, how much to intervene, what steps to take, and so on. So I was aware of
                    that and the geopolitical desire to improve relations with China. I wasn't aware
                    of that memo from President Nixon to Kissinger of February 1, 1969. I was not
                    aware of the efforts to get in touch secretly with China. I was already aware,
                    of course, that we had talks going on with the Chinese Communists in Warsaw. At
                    the time those talks were being reported through official State Department
                    channels. They were generally just sort of propaganda exchanges. Once I became
                    Special Assistant I was privy to all these moves, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: These were not actually resumed
                        unti1970. There was an effort to try to get them going again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Then they were broken off again after the incursion into Cambodia by U.S.
                    and South Vietnamese forces in the spring of 1970. When I became a Special
                    Assistant to Kissinger, I was immediately told about the secret Vietnam
                    negotiations and the secret China negotiations. I was more generally aware,
                    then, of our dealing with Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin on the Russian front. I was
                    involved in some of these issues but I didn't become fully involved,
                    particularly with the message passing to China, until I became a Special
                    Assistant to Kissinger in 1970.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: You mentioned that you took part
                        imeetings on the clashes along the Ussuri River.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Was there ever a discussion of the
                        UniteStates taking a clearer position on these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: As I've said from the beginning of this, I don't want to mislead anyone
                    with a memory precision which I don't have. Again, I think that Kissinger's book
                    would be the most detailed on this. There was certainly a feeling by Kissinger
                    and, I assume, by Nixon, that in the geopolitical picture it would be dangerous
                    for America if the Russians were to humiliate China. Also, these clashes gave us
                    an opening with China; they really brought home their concerns and maybe made
                    them more receptive to our overtures. Therefore, the issues were what signals
                    could we send, either by restraining the Russians or what we might say publicly
                    or on background, and how could we get word to the Chinese that we didn't want
                    them to be humiliated? I don't recall the details of any actual debate about
                    whether we would move military assets around, how much we would threaten the
                    Russians, or how much we would say on background.</p>
                <p>Kissinger's main interest was the fact that there was tension on thSino-Soviet
                    border and that this gave us an opening to China.</p>
                <p>So in 1969 and in 1970-1971 there were these public signals and attempts to get
                    through to the Chinese through various channels. Again, the great detail would
                    be in books by Kissinger and others, including Isaacson and so on.</p>
                <p>This effort began to be more pronounced in the spring of 1971, of course. There
                    was the ping pong diplomacy business and there was also an interview which
                    Chairman Mao had with Edgar Snow. This interview indicated some receptivity to
                    better relations with the United States. Nixon, of course...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Edgar Snow was a...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Biographer of Mao and a journalist who had spent many years iChina.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He wrote Red Star Over China.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes. This book spoke admiringly of the Chinese Communists and of the
                    Chinese revolution. We saw this interview as part of a signal back to us. I
                    can't recall the precise chronology. We didn't get much back from some of the
                    channels we opened up through the Romanians and the French. These wouldn't
                    necessarily consist of verbatim messages passed back and forth. There would just
                    be Nixon telling Ceausescu or De Gaulle that the next time they were in touch
                    with the Chinese they might say that the U.S. was interested in better relations
                    with China. It would be at that level.</p>
                <p>I don't remember the precise chronology, but it became clear, certainly by 1971,
                    that the Pakistani channel was the one to follow. We began to do it through
                    Hilaly, the Pakistani Ambassador to Washington, who would come to us with
                    hand-written messages from the Chinese, passed through Islamabad to him. He
                    would bring these messages into Kissinger's office, and we would prepare
                    hand-written messages back. Often, I would draft them, or Kissinger would. Then
                    he and I would go over the draft and send it back through Ambassador Hilaly. The
                    issue became how do we move this relationship forward and how do we get beyond
                    the issue of Taiwan dominating the agenda?</p>
                <p>There was one exchange in Warsaw, in which the Chinese indicated, more or less on
                    the record and through that channel, that they would be willing to see an
                    American emissary come to China. This was phrased in general terms. Meanwhile,
                    we picked up on that in the private messages through the Pakistanis. Again, I
                    can't give you an exact chronology here. There were gaps in the contacts,
                    sometimes lasting for months. Then through the Pakistani channel the Chinese
                    began to talk about a possible American visitor to China.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>There were two issues facing us. One was who would go? Also, what would the
                    ground rules be? These were matters which were dangerous for both sides. So a
                    lot of these messages were designed by us to get Chinese agreement. For us the
                    issue couldn't just be Taiwan. Their initial position was, more or less: “Send
                    someone over here. We can talk to you, but you must resolve the Taiwan issue
                    before we can do anything else.” We wanted to maneuver it so that while we were
                    willing to talk about Taiwan - of course, we would have to do that or we
                    wouldn't get anywhere with them - there would be a broader agenda as well. We
                    finally got to the point in these messages where the Chinese agreed that an
                    American emissary would come and talk about a possible trip to China by
                    President Nixon. The emissary would not only talk about Taiwan but about other
                    matters as well. This was the breakthrough, in the spring of 1971.Once we had
                    established that this was not just a single issue agenda, that they were willing
                    to consider a Nixon trip, and that they were prepared to receive an American
                    emissary first, then we could begin to get concrete. Right about this time, in
                    the spring of 1971, we had the incident of ping pong diplomacy. This essentially
                    involved an American ping pong team in Japan, which the Chinese invited to visit
                    China. The ping pong team agreed. They went to China and had a warm reception.
                    This was a major development. In fact, we hadn't had a group like that going to
                    China throughout this period. We, of course, understood this event, particularly
                    against the backdrop of our secret channel, that this was a clear signal by them
                    to us that they wanted to move ahead and that they were beginning to prepare
                    their own public for some movement on relations with the U.S. The invitation to
                    the ping pong team was a very carefully calculated move by the Chinese.</p>
                <p>So we had the secret channel getting more receptive regarding an American
                    emissary and the fact that the agenda would be broader than Taiwan. We had the
                    public comments by Mao to Edgar Snow, although I forget the date of this
                    interview. Then we had the ping pong diplomacy incident. Meanwhile, we had taken
                    some unilateral steps, so things were beginning to move.</p>
                <p>Q: You were talking about China. You had John Holdridge, who was a China expert
                    in the State Department. Here Nixon and Kissinger were trying to puzzle out
                    China, which they obviously had no intimate knowledge of. Where were you getting
                    the input for the messages you were drafting? Did it come from the CIA [Central
                    Intelligence Agency], Holdridge, or someone else about what the Chinese were
                    probably thinking?</p>
                <p>LORD: That's a very fair question. First, Holdridge knew quite a bit about China
                    and spoke Chinese. I want to make clear that I am talking about my own role, but
                    Holdridge was clearly crucial here and throughout this period. He brought a lot
                    of knowledge on the China issue to Kissinger and, through him, to President
                    Nixon. In addition, we would ask the bureaucracy for various studies on China,
                    not saying what the real purpose was, in terms of setting up a secret or
                    dramatic breakthrough. However, these were legitimate study memoranda about
                    China and they were very useful. Also we were moving ahead with these
                    unilateral, economic steps. We would ask for analysis of the economic situation
                    and other background material, as required.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>Quite a bit of material was submitted by the State Department, CIA, and other
                    government departments, in a legitimate exercise of looking at policy options,
                    generally informing the President and so on. Then, in addition, Kissinger began
                    consulting, on an individual basis, with outside scholars and experts on China.
                    This included Allan Whiting, a Far Eastern specialist, and Andre Malraux, from
                    France, who had written the book, “Man's Fate,” and knew something about China.
                    Malraux saw President Nixon as well. I'm sure that these consultations included
                    others but I just can't recall them all.</p>
                <p>I assume that President Nixon began to read up on China, as well. I certainly did
                    the same. So there was a combination of Holdridge on the NSC staff; official
                    memoranda from the bureaucracy, requested from the White House; intelligence
                    reports in the normal course of events; and consultations with outside experts.
                    I'll get into the preparations for Nixon's trip later. Does that answer your
                    question?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: One of the criticisms of the secrecy of this whole operation was that we
                    couldn't fully take advantage of the people in the State Department, on the
                    China desk. We included them finally, as we went along after the 1971 Kissinger
                    trip. However, for a long while people would say that we didn't have the full
                    advantage of their knowledge. Having said that, I would say that we would often
                    get this knowledge by asking for memos. As we went forward on trips, we began to
                    take this material with us. Kissinger went on nine trips from 1971-76. I was on
                    every one. He brought along with him State Department people like Al Jenkins and
                    Marshall Green, of course [Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs],
                    in addition to others who could provide supplementary information and views.
                    You're right. We didn't have the intimate, day to day exchanges that some of
                    these people might have provided, had they been included.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any idea who was sending the hand-written
                        notes frothe Chinese side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: We assumed that they were prepared by Zhou En-lai personally, after
                    checking with Mao. There was no question that something of this magnitude was
                    probably from Zhou En-lai. We didn't know whether Zhou En-lai personally drafted
                    these notes or somebody who was the equivalent of Win Lord on his side. Clearly,
                    these notes had Zhou En-lai's personal touch.</p>
                <p>Q: One other question on the beginning of this opening to China. In a way,
                    Pakistan seemed like an unlikely choice. Was there concern about a possible
                    leakage? Were there any quid pro quos for the Pakistanis?</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>LORD: Well, as I said, we sort of tried various channels to see which ones the
                    Chinese were most comfortable with. They chose the Pakistanis. I think that they
                    did it because Pakistan had been friendly to them. China was having its problems
                    with India. They had a war with India in 1962, so China had always leaned toward
                    Pakistan, supporting it on the Kashmir issue, for example. The Chinese generally
                    had a solid relationship with Pakistan. In fact, that has continued all the way
                    through to the present day.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, on our side, we also would lean, on the whole, toward Pakistan. First
                    of all, because we felt that India was lined up with the Soviet Union. Although
                    India was head of the Non-Aligned Movement, it kept doing things that annoyed
                    us. Even under previous American administrations, and more especially under
                    Nixon and Kissinger, we tilted, to use the famous word, toward Pakistan. So
                    Pakistan was a country which was friendly toward both sides, the United States
                    and China. I think that's probably the main reason that the Chinese settled on
                    Pakistan. There was little danger of leaks to India or Russia, which were two of
                    the main concerns in terms of the opening to China at that point.</p>
                <p>The other issue, of course, was who was going to go to China? There was some
                    debate, as recounted in Kissinger's book. President Nixon was ambivalent about
                    anybody going because it might take away from the drama of his going to China.
                    Of course, by then he had this complicated relationship with Kissinger in terms
                    of ego and sensitivity. However, he also wanted someone who could handle this
                    trip effectively, and Kissinger was the best person to do that. He also
                    recognized that he just couldn't go to China cold turkey and without preliminary
                    preparations. He realized that it was necessary to prepare the way. We weren't
                    even sure before the Kissinger trip whether the Nixon trip would even be
                    possible. The purpose of the Kissinger trip was to set up the Nixon trip. We had
                    to see whether there was enough to go on, to protect our flanks, and to see
                    whether we could get around the Taiwan issue. So it was a tricky thing.</p>
                <p>There was some debate whether we should send Ambassador David Bruce, Ambassador
                    Ellsworth Bunker, and I forget the other names that were discussed. I think that
                    at one point Nixon just suggested to Kissinger that maybe Secretary of State
                    Rogers should go. I don't think Nixon ever seriously considered that. Of course,
                    from the beginning, Kissinger wanted to go. He thought that he was the best
                    person to handle it, and I think that he was. Not to mention Kissinger's ego,
                    sense of history, and so on.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>Finally, they settled on Kissinger but, even then, there was some debate about
                    where they, Kissinger and the Chinese, would meet. I think that there was some
                    discussion that perhaps they didn't actually have to meet in China and that they
                    could meet somewhere else. I think that there was a feeling that Nixon preferred
                    that rather than have Kissinger go to Beijing, which had a certain drama. Maybe
                    they could just meet over the border in southern China, across the border from
                    Pakistan, or something like that. Again, it wouldn't be the same thing as going
                    to the capital city of the Middle Kingdom [traditional Chinese name for China].
                    It would reserve more drama for Nixon.</p>
                <p>Kissinger, of course, was all in favor of making this trip as dramatic and as
                    central as possible. He also felt that with the Chinese, in terms of psychology
                    and face, a willingness for the American emissary to go to the capital of the
                    Middle Kingdom would be useful. Another consideration was that Kissinger could
                    meet whomever he needed to meet much more directly. This would be no more
                    complicated, in terms of secrecy, than some other place in China. So eventually,
                    and I don't recall the exact chronology or the number of messages that went back
                    and forth, they settled on Kissinger going. They settled on the agenda including
                    issues in addition to Taiwan, and on holding the meeting in Beijing. Then they
                    agreed that, with the cooperation of Pakistan, they would make the trip to China
                    through Pakistan.</p>
                <p>Before getting to the secret trip itself, are there any questionthat you want to
                    ask, as background at this point?</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: I have a question if it qualifies as background.
                    Otherwise, postpone it. You mentioned the Taiwan issue several times. I was
                    wondering if you could say anything about the attitude of Kissinger and Nixon,
                    perhaps, toward Taiwan? What did they think of Taiwan at this time and how
                    significant did they feel that it was as an obstacle?</p>
                <p>LORD: I think that you have to be careful in retrospect. I think that it's fair
                    to summarize their position as being friendly to Taiwan. Their feeling was that,
                    in terms of American national interests however, you have to take some risks in
                    that relationship, in order to move ahead with China. However, this must be done
                    carefully, both out of loyalty to Taiwan and always conscious that, if you
                    mistreat your friends, other allies and friends are going to get nervous about
                    your steadiness. For example, that was a clear motive for our trying to get out
                    of Vietnam honorably, and not undermining our credibility in terms of how we
                    treat our allies. This point applied to Taiwan. Clearly, Nixon and Kissinger
                    wanted to square the circle. They wanted to open up with China without having to
                    go too far in destroying our relationship with Taiwan and, in the course of
                    doing this, not only hurting our international reputation for steadiness and
                    friendship with our allies, but also stirring up domestic opposition to
                    mistreating an old friend.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>So it was a cool-headed, hard-headed, and calculated sense of geopolitics which
                    drove our desire to open up with China for all of the reasons that I've
                    mentioned. We desired to do this with minimum disruption on the Taiwan front,
                    but knowing that we were going to have to do some fancy footwork with the
                    Chinese. From the very beginning, and this is reflected in the Shanghai
                    Communique, the strategy was, in effect, and I think that it was effectively
                    carried out, to postpone resolution of the Taiwan issue, try to appeal to
                    Beijing's sense of geopolitics and fear of the Soviet Union and its desire to
                    break out of it isolation, and to try to override its preoccupation with Taiwan.
                    So we needed to devise an approach, and eventual language, that would preserve
                    Beijing's position and preserve our interests. The idea was to keep working on
                    the Taiwan issue, but we would kick it down the road for later resolution. So
                    that was the basic approach.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: One other factor. You also mentioned relationships
                    with allies and the importance of secrecy prior to this. There have been some
                    suggestions, in some of the books written about this episode, that Kissinger
                    didn't like the Japanese very much and that some of the secrecy involved in this
                    trip was intended to send a message to the Japanese.</p>
                <p>LORD: I wouldn't go nearly that far, because Japan is an important ally, and he
                    wouldn't want to disrupt the alliance. I think that it is fair to say, and this
                    continues to the present day, that Kissinger always had a certain suspicion of
                    Japan, even as he had of Russia, versus a predilection to go easier on the
                    Chinese. I've discussed this with him, and this view still persists. But surely
                    he did not wish to hurt our ties with Tokyo or send any message.</p>
                <p>Kissinger was genuinely concerned about leaks out of Japan, feeling that the
                    Japanese were particularly prone to leaks in their media. He was aware of the
                    Japanese-Chinese love-hate relationship, because of World War II and other
                    matters. So it wasn't as if Kissinger wanted to hurt our relations with Japan.
                    He was certainly too calculating in terms of American national interests to go
                    out of his way to annoy Japan. That wasn't the point. However, he was prepared
                    to run some risks to pull off the China trip correctly and not be pressured,
                    whether by Japan or others, to lock ourselves into a position with the Chinese
                    before we even set out.</p>
                <p>Now Kissinger would be the first to admit that, as we moved to improve relations
                    with China, we didn't handle the Japan side very well. The dilemma we faced
                    about pre-briefing other nations is that we might be pressured by Japan and
                    others to take positions before we even sat down with the Chinese. Kissinger and
                    Nixon had the feeling that this was totally uncharted territory. It may look
                    relatively easy and inevitablin retrospect, but it was very uncertain at the
                    time. Making this trip to China was not without its risks, despite our feeling
                    that the Chinese would be receptive because of their fear of the Soviets and of
                    their isolation. Therefore, we wanted as free a hand as we could get when we sat
                    down with the Chinese.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>I don't know whether Kissinger would agree with me on this, but, in retrospect, I
                    believe what we should have done to square this circle was to have someone, not
                    very prominent or noteworthy, like myself or Holdridge, go to Japan, perhaps a
                    week before the secret trip to China, or something like that. Such a person
                    could have gone personally to Sato, who, I think, was the Japanese Prime
                    Minister then and informed him in advance. In this way, as a minimum, when this
                    news broke, he could have said that he had been informed in advance by the
                    United States. We could have informed him and sworn him to secrecy. I think that
                    it would have been worth taking that risk of a leak to have done this shortly
                    before the secret Kissinger trip to Beijing.</p>
                <p>I don't think any of us proposed this then, and I doubt whether Kissinger would
                    have agreed to this. I think that he would have felt that this wouldn't work
                    because Prime Minister Sato would have to tell his cabinet colleagues or be
                    considered complicitous himself in holding back this information. Then it would
                    leak out, and all the down side of advance publicity I have talked about before
                    would have occurred. We surely gave a shock to Japan, not to mention to some of
                    our NATO allies and others. You could make a case for tipping off Japan more
                    than Europe, since this was an Asian event. We might have informed the Japanese
                    leader so that he could at least say, as a matter of saving face, that he knew
                    in advance, as opposed to admitting that he knew nothing. The fact is that Japan
                    had been holding back in its relations with China, primarily at our insistence.
                    The Japanese were very anxious to move ahead, at least a little bit, in their
                    relations with China. They held back because we kept urging them not to do that.
                    So they felt betrayed when we leap-frogged them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a matter of any debate beforehand in Washington,
                        when yowere making the preparations for the Kissinger visit to Beijing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: It must have been, but I can't recall any vivid debates, believe it or not.
                    We must have talked about whom else to tell about this trip. These arguments
                    about secrecy or not must have been explored. However, I don't recall this as
                    being an ongoing, vivid, and raging debate. I certainly don't recall myself or
                    anyone else, pressuring Kissinger to tell our friends of this trip in advance. I
                    want to be fair about that.</p>
                <p>Q: Particularly because of the impact on Japan, was there anyone in the NSC or in
                    the immediate circle of people dealing with this trip who was really a Japan
                    expert and who would understand the impact on Japan?</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>LORD: I think that almost anybody would understand that. You wouldn't have to be
                    a genius or a Japan expert to realize that this visit to China by Kissinger
                    would have a major impact. In retrospect, I don't think that we fully
                    appreciated the depth of the shock and perhaps, a Japan expert would have
                    brought this home. Certainly, John Holdridge knew enough about Japan to
                    understand this. It's not as if we hadn't been dealing with Japan. We had a
                    recently completed agreement on Okinawa, which was quite significant. We had
                    some sporadic textile negotiations. I want to make clear that Kissinger,
                    whatever his belief that Japan some day may go nuclear or become nationalistic
                    again, certainly, as a friend and ally wouldn't want to go out of his way to
                    cause trouble for Japan. Of course, Kissinger had certain priorities and was
                    worried about leaks.</p>
                <p>So I think that Kissinger and Nixon probably didn't fully appreciate the totally
                    devastating blow which the announcement of the Kissinger visit to China would be
                    in Japan. They certainly were aware that this announcement was going to break
                    some crockery. They weighed carefully these considerations. However, I don't
                    recall any raging debates about this, although I could be wrong. I certainly
                    don't recall my pressing any other course than what we did, even though, in
                    retrospect, I would have done it differently.</p>
                <p>As we got into May and June, 1971 and with messages transmitted through the
                    Pakistanis we settled on the dates, places, and everything else. I know that we
                    had to bring our Ambassador to Pakistan, Farland, into the preparations, and the
                    CIA, about how we would do this. Farland came to the US, I believe California,
                    for consultations. We got some special briefcases from the CIA with locks on
                    them, and we began to get ready for the Kissinger trip to China. Together with
                    Holdridge, I began feeding Kissinger with lots of briefing material, some of
                    which we would get from the bureaucracy in innocent ways and other materials
                    which we produced ourselves.</p>
                <p>Kissinger chose three people to go to China with him. Myself, as a sort of global
                    sidekick, Holdridge as the Asia and China expert, and Dick Smyser, as the
                    Vietnam expert. The Vietnam issue would be a significant factor in the
                    discussions in China. Those were the four, including Kissinger himself, whom he
                    chose to go into China, as well as two Secret Service agents. Kissinger began
                    reading extensively on Chinese history, culture, and so on. I, of course, did
                    the same. I fed him other materials. We began to prepare strategy papers and
                    talking points on various issues or formulations, some of which we would get
                    from past State Department papers. Our famous formulation on Taiwan, that the
                    U.S. acknowledge the view of Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, etc. I
                    believe it drew upon earlier State Department think pieces and so on. Whether it
                    was history, culture, or personal portraits, I'm sure that we requisitioned some
                    of this material from the CIA and the State Department, although carefully, to
                    disguise our real purposes. I can't recall just how much I drew upon my wife at
                    that point, in terms of what she suggested reading.</p>

                <p>So Kissinger began to bone up on this material. I think that we met with the CIA
                    and Farland in California at some point to go over some of the secret logistics
                    of how to get in and out of China secretly. At one point we went down to Key
                    Biscayne, Florida and spent a few days game playing the trip, thinking about it,
                    and preparing memos. So we began to get ready for it.</p>
                <p>Now, as you recall, there was a publicly announced trip that Kissinger took. It
                    included Vietnam, Thailand, India, and Pakistan. Then Kissinger was supposed to
                    return to Washington through Paris. That was the public itinerary. However, the
                    game plan was to go off secretly to Beijing from Pakistan and by pleading
                    illness and the need to go to a Pakistani hill station to spend a couple of days
                    allegedly recuperating while, in fact, Kissinger was secretly going into
                    China.Ironically, Kissinger came down with a real stomach-ache in India, and so
                    he actually was sick in advance of this secret trip. He covered this up as much
                    as possible, because he wanted to save his real illness until he arrived in
                    Pakistan. I should point out that for the public trip the key U.S. Air Force
                    Special Missions aircraft were taken up for one reason or another. We had a
                    rather poor aircraft. It had no windows and was quite noisy, as I recall. [FYI:
                    This was a KC-135 tanker aircraft with fuel tanks removed and passenger
                    accommodations installed. These aircraft have one fairly small window over each
                    wing. END FYI]</p>
                <p>I had the rather incredible job of juggling three types of briefing memos and
                    schedules. There were three groups of people on this flight. In one group were
                    Kissinger, Holdridge, Smyser, and myself, who not only knew that we were going
                    into China but also were privy to the talking points, the strategy, and all of
                    the stuff that we needed to get ready. Not to mention the logistic details on
                    when we would sneak out of Pakistan and how we would do it. This was all on a
                    tightly constricted aircraft, I might add, on which we were going around to
                    these other places. So I would have to keep those briefing memos up to date,
                    including the logistics, the schedule, and the substance. There was the constant
                    harassment by Kissinger of keeping them up to date and in not too gentle a
                    fashion. I had to make sure that only Kissinger, Smyser, and Holdridge would see
                    certain briefing books. I'm talking about people sitting right next to each
                    other on the plane, some of whom knew of the secret trip to China and some of
                    whom did not.</p>
                <p>Then there was another group. I know that it included Hal Saunders, NSC
                    Specialist for Near Eastern Affairs, who was along because we were visiting
                    India and Pakistan. People in this group knew that we were going into China,
                    because they had to help cover for us. However, they had no need to know what
                    our strategy and talking points were with the Chinese. So Hal and a couple of
                    others had another series of briefing books. These were sanitized or excerpted
                    copies of the other memos.</p>
                <p>There was the third group of people who didn't even know that we were going to
                    China. They had to get a completely different set of logistics and
                    non-substantive memos, as well as substantive papers on matters with which they
                    were concerned.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>So there was the usual harassment of Kissinger always looking for excellence and
                    always revising things and asking me repeatedly to update things, complicated by
                    the fact that I had to do three different versions of these revisions. This was
                    one of the more hectic times of my life. Of course, it was so exciting and
                    dramatic that I never begrudged any of this. However, it was a challenge.
                    Kissinger himself has said in his memoirs that it was a rather extraordinary
                    performance on my part. So all of that was quite exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering, what was the take that was coming through
                        thsystem that you were seeing on the leadership in China at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Before answering that, there are a couple of things that I want to recall
                    before I forget them. There are a couple of amusing vignettes. Of course, of all
                    the secret things that Kissinger did, along with the Vietnam negotiations, this
                    was the most secret of all. Kissinger swore me to secrecy, as he always did.
                    However, he also understood that I had a very open relationship with my wife and
                    that I was telling her everything. At least Kissinger suspected that. I never
                    quite admitted or denied it. I just trusted her. That's the kind of marriage I
                    have, and I also wanted to get her advice, particularly on China. She was born
                    in Shanghai and is of Chinese ancestry.</p>
                <p>Kissinger has said in his memoirs something about the agony of preparing for this
                    trip. He recalls that he told me that I couldn't even tell my wife about it
                    because she was Chinese and would be suspected if there were any leaks. She knew
                    a certain amount about our China policies. However, I was careful. I let her
                    know that we were trying to open up relations with China. I wasn't precise with
                    her about the details of the secret trip but I wanted her to know that we were
                    going to go to China. I also wanted to keep my pledge to Kissinger. So the night
                    before we left Washington on the publicly-announced trip, I called her over to
                    the window of our house and said: “Look out there. I think that I see a 'Peking
                    Tom'" and smiled. Of course, she understood what was going on.</p>
                <p>Another thing is that I called her parents, as I always did, to say good-bye
                    before setting off on this trip. I'm very close to my parents-in-law. I'll never
                    know why, but my mother-in-law said: “Hope you enjoy your 'Peking Duck.'” I
                    almost fell off the chair! I don't recall whether there was any public
                    speculation about Kissinger going to China. I don't believe so. In fact, I'm
                    sure that there wasn't. So I don't know how she had this instinct. Certainly my
                    wife had not told her! I was very careful about leakage, of course, and I
                    totally trusted her. Even in this connection I was a little vague, but I know
                    that I wanted her to know where I was going.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>The other point I want to make before we get into your question is that, during
                    this period we were trying to improve relations with Russia. We had a mixed bag
                    of results in this connection in 1969 and up to the summer of 1971. We're
                    talking about July, 1971. We had been suggesting for some time that there should
                    be a summit meeting between President Nixon and Chairman Brezhnev. The Russians
                    were dragging their feet on this proposal, as well as on the issues of Berlin
                    and arms control. We clearly got the Russians' attention after this secret trip,
                    and things began moving immediately. The point is that we were still prepared to
                    have a summit meeting with Russia and, indeed, before we had a summit meeting
                    with China, if we could arrange one when we went to Beijing.</p>
                <p>We wanted to get our sequence straight before we landed in China. So there were
                    instructions for Deputy National Security Adviser Haig to call in Soviet
                    Ambassador Dobrynin while we were traveling and to make one last suggestion of a
                    Summit Meeting with Moscow. Haig was supposed to let us know the outcome of this
                    proposal as we traveled. Anyhow, Haig made the pitch, Ambassador Dobrynin turned
                    it down on instructions, or at least put it off. Haig called me at 3:00 AM local
                    time in Bangkok. He got me out of bed. We used double talk on the phone, but
                    Kissinger said that this wouldn't have fooled a kindergarten kid. Basically, he
                    was saying that the Russians had turned us down.</p>
                <p>We then made a clear decision that we would have a summit meeting with China
                    first, assuming that we could arrange it, as opposed to a summit meeting with
                    Russia. Of course, the Russians couldn't know how they were screwing up, because
                    they certainly would have accepted a summit meeting first in Moscow, had they
                    known that we were considering a summit meeting in Beijing. So that is of some
                    significance.</p>
                <p>Now, to get to your question. I don't recall all of the information we got on the
                    Chinese leadership at that time. I'm sure that we drew on the resources of all
                    of the U.S. Government agencies, including the CIA as well as the State
                    Department. I just don't recall what these various sources said about the
                    Chinese leadership. Clearly, I don't think that we could have appreciated the
                    courage and vision that we saw in Mao and Zhou En-lai before we began to
                    interact with them. I would quickly add that we saw these qualities, along with
                    all of the other terrible attributes of both of these people, particularly Mao
                    Zedong. I don't want my views to be taken out of context.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>We weren't aware of the full extent of the Cultural Revolution, and certainly the
                    horrors of it. I don't think that anybody was. It was clear that Zhou En-lai was
                    a very skillful leader, but the impact that he made on all of us was much
                    greater than we'd been prepared for. We obviously knew that he was a significant
                    figure and that Mao was a major figure. We had no illusions; we knew that these
                    were ruthless people. There was no question about that. You don't get to the top
                    in that system without being ruthless. We knew about the famine, the Great Leap
                    Forward, and what we knew about the Cultural Revolution, not to mention their
                    intervening careers and so on. They talked about nuclear weapons; at that point
                    they not only were in favor of having them themselves but were also relaxed
                    about nuclear proliferation. They were opposed to us on all fronts and they used
                    hostile rhetoric. I mean, this was not an easy crowd to deal with. However, we
                    also knew their incentives in wishing to improve relations with us, and I have
                    talked about them.</p>
                <p>We obviously had detailed CIA and other reports on Mao and Zhou.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Was there any sense of factionalism? Did you have any
                    sense that Mao and Zhou were doing anything that was dangerous to them?</p>
                <p>LORD: I want to be careful about this. I am sure that we assumed that approval
                    for broadened contact with us had to come from Mao. Obviously, it came through
                    Zhou, because he was the man who was signing off on the communications. It was
                    obvious that they were working together. I don't know whether we knew who might
                    be hostile to us or the opening. But we knew that broadened contact with us
                    would be very controversial in China, even as improved relations between the two
                    countries were in the U.S. We didn't know how much they were keeping the fact of
                    our contacts on a close hold basis in their bureaucracy, as we were in ours. One
                    of the reasons for secrecy, in addition to the ones I mentioned, was that there
                    was still opposition in China to what they were doing.</p>
                <p>I have to say that, as I recall, we didn't have a particularly sophisticated
                    sense of Chinese factionalism. Whether Lin Piao would be opposed to this course,
                    for example, or how Mao and Zhou related to each other, although we probably
                    knew that Zhou had survived by being loyal and always being Number Three in the
                    Chinese Communist hierarchy, if possible, and not Number Two. We had the general
                    sense that Zhou was more pragmatic and moderate than Mao, and things like that.
                    However, I just can't recall how perceptive and how sophisticated our analysis
                    of these Chinese leaders really were.</p>
                <p>Q: But you did say that you had no idea of the magnitude of the disaster which
                    the Cultural Revolution was.</p>
                <p>LORD: That's right.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>Q: We had this program for years of interviewing people coming out of China
                    through Hong Kong, reading papers, and so forth. But still, you say, you did not
                    know that the Cultural Revolution was such a disaster.</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, we knew that this was a terrible system and we knew that the Chinese
                    people had suffered. I knew this personally because my sister-in-law, my wife
                    Bette's sister, had escaped from China in late 1962 through Hong Kong, just in
                    time for our wedding. At the time the Chinese authorities were letting some
                    people out because of the terrible famine. She joined her family and was at our
                    wedding in 1963. My wife wrote a book, before we went to Geneva [in 1965],
                    called “Eighth Moon,” based on my sister-in-law's living in China and getting
                    out. So we knew first hand from her of the horrors of the system and the
                    economic problems, as well as the repression. We, of course, knew of the burning
                    of the British Embassy in Beijing and other acts of fanaticism and the isolation
                    of China. So we were aware of these things. I don't think that we had a full
                    sense of just how pervasive and devastating all of these developments were.</p>
                <p>Even though we knew that the Great Leap Forward had been a disaster, I don't
                    think that anyone knew of its extent. Even by Chinese Communist admissions, it
                    was 30 million dead, or something like that. Yes, we knew that this was an
                    unpleasant and terrible system. The Chinese leadership was composed of tough
                    people, and the Chinese people had suffered under them. However, I think that
                    the situation was worse than we realized. Of course, this was somewhat balanced
                    by the emphasis of President Nixon and Kissinger, that the opening up to China
                    was in America's national interest, even though the Chinese leadership was
                    composed of an unpleasant group of people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then how did this trip to China proceed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: A lot of material has already been published about how this secret trip to
                    China worked out. However, this is how the secret trip worked.</p>
                <p>We went publicly to Pakistan. There was a public banquet the first night. We went
                    back to the government guest house. We packed and, at about 3:00 AM we were
                    driven to the Islamabad airport by the Pakistani Foreign Minister I believe -
                    Sultan Khan. It seems that they're all named Khan. I've seen him since. We went
                    to President Yahya Khan's plane. Apparently, there was one reporter from some
                    news service who thought he saw us and reported this to his editor. The editor
                    said that the reporter was crazy and spiked [rejected] the story. I wonder what
                    happened to that guy's career.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>The plan was to be gone on this secret trip to China for 48 hours. We got on
                    Yahya Khan's airplane. Let me talk about the cover story. We took off for China
                    and we left about 4:00 AM. On that morning the story was put out that Kissinger
                    was not feeling well and, at the invitation of the Pakistanis, he was going up
                    to a hill station [mountain resort] to recuperate for a day. There was a Secret
                    Service agent in a car, slumped over. It wasn't supposed to be an impersonation
                    but he played Kissinger up to the hill station and, I believe, Hal Saunders was
                    with him. So there was a motorcade going up to the hill station. All of this was
                    done fairly early in the morning so that there were no journalists around.</p>
                <p>Arrangements were to be made for a Pakistani doctor to attend to Kissinger at the
                    hill station. This doesn't make much sense to me but the way I heard this story,
                    the Pakistanis asked one doctor: “Do you know what Henry Kissinger looks like?”
                    He said: “Yes.” They said: “We're sorry, but you're the wrong man.” So they get
                    another one. In addition, a couple of Pakistani cabinet ministers who were in on
                    this charade went up to the hill station as if they were paying a call on
                    Kissinger.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, of course, we were in China. At the end of that day the Pakistanis put
                    out a communique saying that Kissinger still didn't feel very well and was going
                    to stay another day at the hill station. This meant that our whole, public
                    schedule in Islamabad had to be slipped because we were supposed to leave
                    Pakistan for Paris on the following day. So the rest of the schedule had to be
                    slipped a day. So that was the cover on that front. I don't how many people
                    besides Hal Saunders knew about this, but he and Ambassador Farland were the key
                    men in this respect.</p>
                <p>Returning to our travel, Smyser, Holdridge, Kissinger, and I, plus two Secret
                    Service agents, named Reedy and McLeod arrived at the airport in Islamabad.
                    Reedy was the senior Secret Service agent, and he knew where we were going as we
                    went to the airport. The other Secret Service agent had no idea. We boarded the
                    plane and found four Chinese already seated there. I may be exaggerating this in
                    retrospect but I believe that McLeod went to draw his pistol, because he was so
                    surprised to see these Chinese on the airplane.</p>
                <p>One of the four Chinese in the plane was Zhang Wen-jin, an Assistant Minister of
                    Foreign Affairs in charge of American affairs and a key negotiator with us, just
                    below the Foreign Minister level. He helped to draft the Shanghai Communique. He
                    was a very cultured man. He was later Ambassador to the United States. He was
                    the senior Chinese official in this group which was already on the plane. There
                    were also a Chinese Protocol Officer, a grand-niece of Mao named Wang Hai-rung,
                    and Nancy Tang, an interpreter. There were six of us in our party.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>During some of the plane trip Kissinger was studying his briefing books. During
                    some of the time he was talking to Zhang, and he switched back and forth between
                    these two occupations. I've always made a lot of jokes about this, but Kissinger
                    was genuinely upset by the fact that he had no extra shirts with him. He had a
                    special, personal assistant named David Halperin, who had packed his suitcase
                    but didn't put any shirts in. So I've always said that, instead of worrying
                    about this historic trip and what he was going to say to Zhou En-lai about
                    geopolitics he was fuming about his missing shirts. He really was upset about
                    his shirts. He borrowed a couple of shirts from John Holdridge, who stands about
                    6' 3” in height. Kissinger is about 5' 9”, so he looked like a penguin walking
                    around in one of John's shirts. He really was upset. Here it was, an historic
                    moment, and he felt that he was would look ridiculous. He was really mad at a
                    time when you would think that this would not be a big deal. However, in human
                    terms you could see that at this most important and dramatic time, when he was
                    meeting Zhou En-lai, he would be upset to look ridiculous in this shirt. And, of
                    course, the shirts he borrowed from John Holdridge had a label that said, “Made
                    in Taiwan.”</p>
                <p>Anyway, we were sitting on the plane. I forget how long the flight was. Perhaps
                    seven or eight hours or maybe less than that. Here is a well-known story from
                    this trip. I've always tried to make it sound better than it was. I should tell
                    it as it actually happened. Dick Smyser and I were sitting ahead of Kissinger in
                    the back of the plane. The air crew, of course, was composed of Pakistani cabin
                    attendants and Pakistani pilots, navigators, and flight engineers. No American
                    official had been in China since 1949, so we would be the first American
                    officials to visit China in 22 years. By my good fortune Smyser was called to
                    the back of the plane by Kissinger for consultations just before we got to the
                    border between China and Pakistan. All of the others, in addition to Smyser but
                    not including me, were in the back of the plane with Kissinger. So, as we
                    crossed the border, I was in the front of the plane. So I've said ever since
                    then, in case the question should ever come up, that I was the first American
                    official to visit China since 1949! I've said, on some occasions, that I
                    deliberately raced to the front of the plane to do that, but that's slightly
                    gilding the lilly.</p>
                <p>Obviously, there was a great sense of drama. As the sun came up, we were passing
                    K-2, the second highest mountain in the world. It was right outside our window,
                    with the sun on it. Remember, we were in a Pakistani plane with the usual
                    windows. We had left the nearly windowless KC-135 jet back at Islamabad. There
                    was a sense of drama that we were going to the most populous country in the
                    world, after 22 years and there were all of the geopolitical implications of
                    that. There was the anticipation of meeting with Zhou En-lai, this great figure,
                    and there was the excitement and anticipation of those talks. There were James
                    Bond aspects of this trip, since it was totally secret. For me, personally,
                    there was the realization that I was the first American official to visit China
                    in 22 years and that I was married to a woman from Shanghai. I'll never top this
                    experience in terms of drama.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>Of course, we spent a good deal of time on the plane, discussing what the
                    strategy would be in talking with Zhou En-lai and the Chinese. I had read very
                    carefully the materials we had prepared over the previous several months. I
                    don't have the precise time with me, but we landed at the military side of the
                    airport outside of Beijing. We were met by Marshall Yeh Jien-ying, a well-known
                    Chinese general from the Long March. I don't know whether he was on the
                    Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, but he was a very important figure. So
                    that was a fairly high level reception. Also there to greet us was Huang Hua,
                    who was later Chinese Foreign Minister. We entered limousines with curtains
                    drawn, so people couldn't see into them. Then we drove into Beijing through
                    Tiananmen Square and past the Great Hall of the People to a place called
                    Dayoutai, which is the guest house compound for very important visitors. We were
                    then secretly ensconced there.</p>
                <p>I don't recall how soon it was before Zhou En-lai came over to greet us, but I'm
                    sure that it was right away. We had a banquet that night, sitting around with
                    Zhou En-lai. We had discussions with him which, according to Kissinger's book,
                    lasted for 17 hours. We were in China for a total of 49 hours.</p>
                <p>The major challenge, of course, was to work out an agreement that President Nixon
                    would visit China and to develop some rough sense of what the agenda would be.
                    We agreed in principle that there would be just a brief announcement, which both
                    sides would issue simultaneously, after we got back to Washington.</p>
                <p>However, the real negotiating, and this went on for hours, was about the
                    following. We wanted to make it look essentially that the Chinese wanted
                    President Nixon to come to China. The Chinese essentially wanted to make it look
                    as if Nixon wanted to come to China and that the Chinese were gracious enough to
                    invite him. So we went through our first, agonizing process of negotiation on
                    that issue. At one point we broke off the negotiation, not in a huff, but just
                    recognizing that we were at an impasse. We thought that the Chinese were coming
                    back to the negotiations within a couple of hours. Kissinger and I and the
                    others walked around outside, because we knew that we were being bugged, and we
                    couldn't discuss strategy and tactics unless we walked outside. Probably the
                    trees were bugged, too. Who knows? I remember that we waited for hours and
                    hours. The Chinese were probably trying to keep us off balance and were probably
                    working out their own position. Most likely, Zhou En-lai had to check with Mao
                    Zedong.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>Finally, the Chinese came back, and we resumed the discussion and worked this
                    issue out. I forget the exact language used in the brief communique which was
                    made public. The formulation used went something like this: “Knowing of
                    President Nixon's interest in visiting China...” And in fact he had expressed an
                    interest in visiting China in general. The formulation went on that the Chinese
                    had invited him. So it wasn't as if the Chinese wanted Nixon to come to China
                    and were going out of their way. They used the formulation that they invited him
                    because they had heard about his interest in visiting China. On the other hand,
                    Nixon wasn't begging to go to China. So it was a fair compromise. This matter
                    was covered in a few sentences, essentially, but it was tough to work out.</p>
                <p>In the midst of this negotiation we also did some sightseeing. The Chinese closed
                    off the Forbidden City of Beijing to tourists so that we could visit it
                    privately and on our own. We had the head of the Chinese Archeological Museum
                    and an expert on the area take us around personally as our guide. I'll never
                    forget it. It was a very hot, mid-July day. I was carrying either one or two of
                    these very heavy briefcases. We had to take them everywhere with us. We didn't
                    dare leave them anywhere for security reasons. Of course, it was dramatic to see
                    the Forbidden City all by ourselves. It was also very hot, carrying those damned
                    briefcases around.</p>
                <p>After that we had a Peking Duck luncheon-banquet hosted by Zhou in the Great
                    Hall, I think.. The main topic of conversation was, in fact, the Cultural
                    Revolution. Here we saw just how clever Zhou En-lai was. We know that he,
                    himself, was aghast at the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, which had been
                    unleashed by Mao. At one point he himself had been imprisoned in his office by
                    Red Guards. However, he hadn't survived this long by suddenly being disloyal to
                    Mao and on an issue of that importance.</p>
                <p>The way Zhou recounted this experience was basically as follows. He went through
                    how he had been locked up in his own office. He talked about some of the
                    exchanges he had had with the Red Guards, in a very clinical way. He then used
                    some phrasing like the following. He said: “Chairman Mao is, of course, much
                    more far-seeing and prescient than I am. He saw the need for the 'Cultural
                    Revolution' and all this upheaval and destruction to 'cleanse' the revolution.”
                    I don't recall exactly how he phrased it. Zhou continued: “I wasn't so
                    prescient. I saw the excesses, the problems, and the down side.” He said
                    something like that.</p>
                <p>If Mao read the transcript of what Zhou said, he couldn't have complained,
                    because Zhou En-lai was saying that Mao had a better vision than Zhou did and
                    saw the need for the Cultural Revolution. At the same time Zhou was signaling to
                    us that the Cultural Revolution had gotten out of hand, had become rather
                    brutal, and there were excesses. So it was a typical example of cleverness by
                    Zhou En-lai. He was keeping his flank protected with Mao but was also making
                    sure that the people he was talking to knew that he was a much more reasonable
                    and pragmatic person. It was a fascinating performance. I'm sorry that Smyser
                    missed it because he was sick.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>When we finished drafting the communique, we got back on the plane and returned
                    to Pakistan. We successfully re-inserted ourselves in the charade which had been
                    worked out in Islamabad. We then went on to Paris the next day. It so happens,
                    and we'll get back to this, that while we were publicly in Paris, we secretly
                    snuck off and met with the Vietnamese Communists. Indeed, this was one of the
                    more forthcoming meetings with them. Afterwards Kissinger and I thought,
                    somewhat naively, that we had pulled off two, historic encounters in one trip:
                    the opening toward China and moving toward settling the Vietnam War. That latter
                    idea was a wildly premature judgment. I remember that we debated which was the
                    more historic and important, getting the war over with or arranging for the
                    opening to China. We said, wasn't it a great achievement to do both in one
                    trip?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to the meeting with Zhou En-lai, how were these
                        negotiationcarried out? Was it basically Kissinger and Zhou?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: It was basically Kissinger and sometimes Zhou En-lai. Sometimes it was
                    Zhang Wen-jin or Huang Hua serving as the negotiators on the Chinese side.
                    Correct me here if your own research comes up with a different view, but Zhang
                    Wen-jin and/or Huang Hua seemed to be serving as surrogates for Zhou En-lai. As
                    I said before, in his book Kissinger says that there were about 17 hours of
                    meetings with Zhou En-lai. I think that there were 17 hours of meetings but I
                    can't believe that Zhou En-lai was there that long. Maybe if Kissinger adds in
                    the luncheon and the other contacts with Zhou, the total time of his discussions
                    with Zhou would add up to that. It was a long negotiation, but a lot of the time
                    was taken up with waiting around for the Chinese leaders. We were not really
                    meeting with them for all of this time.</p>
                <p>Now, we didn't just talk about the communique. And each side set forth its
                    positions on many of these key issues. There was considerable geopolitical
                    exchange between Zhou and Kissinger, the beginning of one of the most remarkable
                    multi-year dialogues ever conducted in diplomacy. I was privileged to be present
                    throughout the hundreds of hours of talks between these two giants.</p>
                <p>We also clearly, of course, talked about the agenda for the Nixon visit. We made
                    it clear that, although we would talk about the issue which was the most
                    sensitive and important to them, namely, Taiwan, we also wanted to talk about
                    Russia, the Middle East, South Asia, Korea, and the beginning of bilateral
                    contacts. So we began to set forth the agenda that we wanted to talk about. I'm
                    sure that the Chinese kept emphasizing Taiwan but also agreed that there would
                    be a broader, geopolitical discussion. In retrospect, I don't know how much time
                    was spent on this. When Zhou En-lai was there, a lot of time was spent on these
                    kinds of issues. Negotiating the communique would have been carried on with his
                    subordinates.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you do? Go through a certain amount of
                        proposals, anthen everybody went back and huddled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, regarding the agenda, we weren't negotiating about a specific agenda.
                    We just wanted to make sure that there were enough common interests and enough
                    to talk about beyond Taiwan that a Nixon trip would be worthwhile. The Chinese,
                    in turn, wanted to make sure that we were sufficiently flexible on Taiwan that
                    they could get around their domestic problems with this issue. It wasn't a
                    matter of negotiating or reducing to specific language these other issues. There
                    was just a philosophic exchange. Indeed, we carefully crafted Kissinger's
                    opening remarks and his talking points both to be sensitive on the Taiwan issue
                    and to put the bigger picture forward and why it was in the interest of both
                    countries to overcome decades of mistrust and hostility. So there were a lot of
                    exchanges. This is where Kissinger was immediately impressed with Zhou En-lai in
                    terms of his sophistication, historical sweep, and eloquence.Regarding the
                    negotiations on the communique, I don't recall exactly how they went, but I'm
                    sure that we had prepared in advance a draft communique which we presented to
                    the Chinese. The Chinese came back with their draft communique. We were far
                    apart and began to haggle about the details, particularly this issue of who
                    invited whom. I can't recall whether we decided, from the very beginning, to
                    keep the communique very brief or whether both sides reached the point where we
                    agreed that this was the only way to do it, that is, to announce the fact that
                    Kissinger had been in China and that Nixon would be going to China in the spring
                    of 1972. I believe this was the first time that the Chinese used their
                    formulation that they knew of Nixon's interest in China and that they had
                    invited him to come.</p>
                <p>I don't recall whether we initially talked about other issues for the communique.
                    I seriously doubt it. We felt that this communique would essentially be an
                    announcement. It was dramatic enough in itself. It would be premature to
                    negotiate on other issues. It would make other people nervous if we said that we
                    had been talking about other matters. I am sure that, from the very beginning,
                    the idea was just to have an announcement that Kissinger had visited China and
                    that there would be a forthcoming Nixon trip. It was agreed that we had to
                    maintain secrecy until we returned to the US. Certainly, President Nixon wanted
                    to make the announcement himself, given the drama surrounding the matter. That
                    was understood, and the Chinese went along with that.</p>
                <p>Q: I take it then that there was considerable discipline on both sides in
                    avoiding political diatribes or simply setting out well known positions and all
                    that sort of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>LORD: I would have to go back and look at the transcripts. Since Zhou En-lai was
                    as sophisticated as he was, he would be firm in their positions on all of these
                    issues, including Taiwan and other, geopolitical matters, but he also indicated
                    his desire to move ahead with the relationship of China and the United States.
                    His rhetoric would have been carefully modulated, so that it wouldn't turn us
                    off. We, in turn, would be firm but clear that, despite our differences, we
                    wanted to move ahead. Kissinger, on behalf of Nixon, was forthcoming on Taiwan
                    even as he sketched the broad agenda. Indeed he began to set forth some
                    important assurances on our Taiwan policy that impressed the Chinese side.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Dick Solomon has suggested, in some of the work he has
                    done on negotiating with the Chinese Communists, that Kissinger so much enjoyed
                    talking to Zhou En-lai that he would tend to go beyond his talking points and
                    range more broadly.</p>
                <p>LORD: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: In this particular instance of the secret trip to
                    China Kissinger may have said some things that, perhaps, would not have been
                    said had they been pre-rehearsed, in the sense that it was good to use the
                    Chinese-American relationship as a joint U.S. and Chinese way to keep Japan
                    under control. Or that Kissinger gave more ground than he might have on...</p>
                <p>LORD: I would have to go back and review the transcripts. There is no question
                    that in the discussions between Kissinger and Zhou En-lai they would range more
                    widely, on this trip and on subsequent occasions when they got to know each
                    other better. There would be a tendency to sit back and get away from the
                    immediate questions at hand. This was in contrast with the practice when we were
                    negotiating with Zhou En-lai's subordinates on specific language. Kissinger
                    would have prepared talking points and positions on all of these issues.</p>
                <p>At times Kissinger might push the envelope or use ambiguous formulations which
                    might tempt the Chinese. He was forthcoming on Taiwan. As for other issues, he
                    might have said things on certain issues that he would probably be embarrassed
                    about if they were shown to the country that he was talking about.</p>
                <p>On Japan, for example, Kissinger's basic thrust would have been to tell the
                    Chinese that the U.S.-Japan alliance is in our interest and is in China's
                    interest. So he would have said that Japan has an impulse toward nationalism and
                    rearming. However, if the Japanese feel secure under the U.S. nuclear umbrella,
                    or our security alliance, then they won't go in that direction. Therefore,
                    Kissinger would say, it is in China's interest for the U.S. to have good
                    relations with Japan. We worked on them in that connection.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>In the initial meetings the Chinese attitude was: “We don't like your alliance
                    with Japan. We don't like alliances in general and we also don't like foreign
                    troops on another country's soil. You are just building up Japan and making it
                    more dangerous.” We would counter by saying: “If we didn't have this tie with
                    Japan, they might go nuclear and rearm and be a greater threat to your security.
                    So you ought to be in favor of this alliance.”</p>
                <p>Frankly, that argument made an impact on the Chinese over the following years.
                    They reached the point where they clearly agreed with us. They have held this
                    position ever since, until the last few years, when they have become more
                    ambivalent about Japan.</p>
                <p>Let's just continue with this particular episode, and then we can go back again.
                    Obviously, we were very excited when we got back to Washington. I recall the
                    awkwardness, and I did feel bad about that, when we were flying out from
                    Washington to meet with President Nixon at San Clemente, California, a day or
                    two before the announcement about the Nixon trip, and I was sitting on the plane
                    with U. Alexis Johnson, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. He
                    didn't know anything about the trip which we had made to China. He was an old
                    China hand and had participated, I believe, in the Geneva and Warsaw talks with
                    the Chinese Communists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. He was one of the first to negotiate with the
                        ChinesCommunists, apart from the talks on the Korean armistice.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: He was a very decent man. I sat outside his State Department office during
                    the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. I had dealt with him in Political-Military
                    Affairs and I always respected him. To be flying out with him, knowing that in
                    the next two days there was going to be an announcement on China, and he didn't
                    even know about it, left me feeling very awkward indeed. I still remember
                    that.</p>
                <p>We got out to San Clemente and worked on Nixon's announcement. Nixon's
                    inclination, and I think that he was entirely right, was to keep his remarks
                    very short. It was so dramatic that he didn't need to elaborate. He could get
                    away with a few sentences or a few paragraphs. The eventual announcement was
                    only a few hundred words long.</p>
                <p>Nixon announced in advance that he would be making a statement. Most of the press
                    speculated that it was going to be on Vietnam, as they figured that almost
                    anything would be on Vietnam. None of them knew that it was going to be on
                    China. So we had some tense moments during the 24 hours or 48 hours out in San
                    Clemente, putting together this announcement and, also, the game plan for
                    informing, rather belatedly, countries around the world, not to mention our own
                    governmenWe did this at the last minute. So that was a dramatic time.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, Nixon went on TV and made the announcement.Everyone knows what a
                    dramatic impact it had.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>Meanwhile, I had brought back with me for my Chinese wife a smalsampling of
                    Chinese soil.VII. NSC - CHINA. NIXON TRIP (1971-1972)</p>
                <p>Winston, we now have you back in the U.S. The announcement about the forthcoming
                    Nixon trip has already been made. Did the NSC have occasion to deal with some of
                    the repercussions of the Kissinger trip? We always talk about the Nixon Shocku
                    in Japan and other places in the world. Was there a certain amount of cleaning
                    up, consulting, and letting everybody know about the developments?</p>
                <p>LORD: There certainly was. On the whole, there was an overwhelming, positive
                    reaction abroad. Of course, Japan was upset at the fact that we had leap frogged
                    them and hadn't kept them informed, given our complicated, historical
                    relationships and the loss of face. Some of our allies in Europe would like to
                    have been consulted as well. However, on the whole the reaction was that this
                    was a dramatic development, it was courageous, and it was a geopolitical
                    earthquake. It was considered basically in the U.S. national interest and was
                    greeted with applause.</p>
                <p>This was certainly true at home in the U.S. as well. I'm sure that there was some
                    conservative sniping at the time. No question of that. However, on the whole,
                    this announcement stunned everybody and was basically greeted as a major,
                    diplomatic move. So I think that the malaise about the shocks and the lack of
                    consultation was dwarfed by the positive reaction that was received.</p>
                <p>This trip really catapulted Kissinger into fame. He already was achieving a
                    higher profile, but you have to remember that until now, and still for some
                    time, he didn't hold on the record press conferences. I'm trying to remember
                    whether there was a follow-up interview with Kissinger at San Clemente. I can't
                    recall. Basically, his meetings with the press were on background, but he was
                    getting more and more famous. This really, as it were, put him on the map.</p>
                <p>Yes, we were dealing with various countries. I'm sure that the State Department
                    had to take the brunt of this, even though they didn't know about this
                    development in advance, either. Japan presented the most serious problem, but I
                    don't recall the specific details.</p>
                <p>Q: The thing was that this visit went over so well that it overwhelmed what might
                    have been the conservative opposition in the United States.</p>
                <p>LORD: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there wasn't any particular battle about it that I
                        recall. Let's continue on the China theme.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>LORD: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what were you doing at this point? Getting ready for
                        the Nixotrip?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. Then we had to work out the exact timing of President Nixon's trip to
                    China and how we got ready for it logistically and substantively.</p>
                <p>Let me pause and say that the most immediate and the most important impact was
                    with Russia. We'll get back to Russia later, but let me say very quickly that we
                    obviously got the attention of the Russians. As I said earlier, we had not been
                    making much progress with the Russians. They hadn't agreed to holding a summit
                    meeting, the SALT negotiations [Strategic Arms Limitation Talks] were going
                    slowly, the Berlin negotiations were not moving ahead, and we had up's and
                    down's in the two previous years. Basically, we were trying to move, and
                    Soviet-American relations were better than they had been in 1970, when we had
                    several crises at once, but on the whole, we were just treading water.</p>
                <p>Then, within weeks, the whole Soviet-American relationship started moving
                    forward. This was very concrete evidence that the opening to China would help us
                    with the Russians, which was one of the purposes of the Kissinger visit to
                    Beijing. Within weeks, or months, the Russians agreed to holding a summit
                    meeting as well, in this case in May, 1972, just a few months after Nixon would
                    go to China. Of course, the Soviets realized that they had miscalculated and
                    that they should have agreed to a summit meeting before the meeting in China was
                    announced. The Soviets were totally caught by surprise. We then made a break
                    through on the Berlin negotiations. I don't remember the dates, but that began
                    moving very quickly, as we moved toward a very significant agreement. We made
                    progress on arms control, so that we set up the SALT-1 agreement by the time we
                    got to Moscow in May, 1972. We began to talk with the Soviets about economic and
                    other arrangements. Of all the reactions to the announcement of the Kissinger
                    trip to China, I would say that the most important one by far, of a positive or,
                    indeed, any nature, was the reaction in Moscow. The most negative impact, of
                    course, was in Japan, where the announcement caused severe embarrassment to the
                    Japanese Government. However, the progress made in relations with the Soviets
                    was very helpful.</p>
                <p>It's hard to judge now how nervous this trip made Hanoi. It certainly didn't make
                    the Vietnamese communist leaders immediately flexible. However, we figured that
                    the combination of the announcement of both of these summit meetings was
                    certainly going to put pressure on Hanoi to be more reasonable. We hoped, of
                    course, that this would give an incentive to both Beijing and Moscow to put such
                    pressure on Hanoi.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>For example, in Beijing there was an ideological embarrassment in moving ahead
                    with the U.S., which was fighting with their Vietnamese compatriots. We didn't
                    realize fully at the time the extent of the Sino-Vietnamese hostility, either.
                    We assumed at the time that, if they were not like lips and teeth, as they had
                    once likened their relationship, at least the Chinese and Vietnamese communists
                    were friendly. It was awkward for the Chinese to have American troops fighting
                    against their ideological compatriots in Vietnam. Therefore, it was in the
                    Chinese interest to try to get this war behind us.</p>
                <p>Similarly in the case of the Russians, it was awkward, while they were trying to
                    improve relations with the United States, to have their friends and allies
                    engaged in a fight with us. In a little while I can get back to the Chinese view
                    of Vietnam and how we dealt with that.</p>
                <p>So the most immediate impact, I'd say, was on Japan, Moscow, and, ta certain
                    extent, Hanoi.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: The Russians had tried, at times, to play the
                    relationship off. In other words, argue to the Americans that they would be
                    better friends of the United States than the Chinese communists would be.</p>
                <p>LORD: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Were you aware of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Oh, yes. This was a constant pattern with the Russians. They certainly
                    didn't say: “We white men have to stick together.” However, you also got the
                    feeling that there might have been a cultural and racial undertone to this. I
                    can't document when the Russians made their moves and at what time. They often
                    floated proposals, including an arms control deal which, they thought, would
                    unnerve the Chinese, as well as NATO. The Russians made references to their view
                    that the Chinese couldn't be trusted, and so on. Of course, this was always
                    deflected by Nixon and Kissinger.</p>
                <p>So we began to think about how to get ready for the Nixon trip to China. I don't
                    remember exactly when we fixed the dates of February 22 to 28, 1972. The
                    announcement only talked about the following spring, I believe. We knew that
                    there would have to be follow-on, advance trips before Nixon went for this visit
                    to this unknown terrain. We had to decide on the specific cities that President
                    Nixon would visit. So we scheduled another trip to China for Kissinger in
                    October, 1971. Al Haig would go to China in January, 1972, and President Nixon
                    would go in February, 1972. When we went to China in October, 1971, I don't
                    believe that we knew that Haig was going to go to China in January, 1972.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>The purpose of the Kissinger trip in October, 1971, was two-fold - substantive
                    and logistic. We needed to prepare substantively for the summit meeting.
                    Regarding the agenda, we needed to get a sense of each side's positions and see
                    what might be said in any outcome, whether a statement or a communique. There
                    would also be further, substantive exchanges between Kissinger and Zhou En-lai,
                    in particular, to prepare the ground for Nixon's conversations when he came to
                    China. Secondly, there were the logistical arrangements to be made. That is,
                    what the schedule would be like, where Nixon would go and where he would stay,
                    what his itinerary would be like, and the security and public relations
                    preparations that would be needed. We wanted even to arrange at that point for
                    satellite ground stations to support international coverage of the visit,
                    although this was rather early in the game for satellite coverage.</p>
                <p>We took along with us a lot of people from the White House staff to deal with the
                    security and press side of the visit. I know that this was when Dwight Chapin
                    and Ron Ziegler went to China. So we had a dual purpose in visiting China in
                    October, 1971.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Why October?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, we had been to China on the secret visit in July, 1971. It took us
                    some time to get our act together and get ready to go back in order to prepare
                    for a Nixon trip that was coming in the spring of 1972. There was no magic
                    aspect of a second Kissinger trip to China in October, 1971. It was just the
                    natural rhythm of the calendar.Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Some people have
                    suggested, and there is some logic to this, that the secret trip was badly timed
                    in terms of the United Nations and the votes there.</p>
                <p>LORD: In retrospect, and to be honest about it, I don't think that we paid much
                    attention to that. You're absolutely right that the timing of the secret trip
                    was awkward in terms of the UN vote on Chinese representation. Our objective was
                    to prepare for a Nixon visit to China. However, as we got on the airplane and
                    were flying out of Shanghai - we flew from Beijing to Shanghai and then flew out
                    of Shanghai en route back to the United States - we learned that we had lost the
                    vote in the UN on the admission of the People's Republic of China. We had still
                    been holding out, trying to ensure that, at least, Taiwan could stay in the UN
                    as well. Of course, China would only accept one representative for China's seat.
                    That was an embarrassing finale, to say the least, because it drove home the
                    realization that we were causing pain to our friends with this opening to
                    China.</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>You're absolutely right, and that's a good question. Why a second visit to China
                    in October, 1971? In retrospect, we should have had a better sense of timing,
                    and I just don't recall whether anybody said: “Do we really want to go to China
                    in the middle of this UN debate?” I just can't recall whether we took this
                    matter into our calculations. This was a tactical mistake. On the other hand,
                    once we had made this dramatic breakthrough in July 1971, the UN sentiment was
                    going to shift. We had to go sometime in the fall, during the UN General
                    Assembly session so there was always going to be some awkwardness</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went on all of the trips in connection with
                        preparations fothe Nixon visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I went on all of the trips during the Nixon and Ford Administrations. There
                    were nine trips to China. There were separate visits to China by President Nixon
                    and by President Ford. Kissinger made seven other trips to China, not including
                    the Nixon and Ford visits. I went on all nine trips. I did not go on the Haig
                    January 1972 trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the trip to China by Al Haig?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Haig went on his own to China in January, 1972. I don't know whether he
                    ever went to China again, to be honest. However, as he was Kissinger's deputy,
                    he wouldn't travel with Kissinger. He would mind the store at home when
                    Kissinger went abroad.</p>
                <p>Q: During the period between the time you came back from the first trip to China
                    to October, 1971, you obviously had other things that you had to do, in
                    connection with the Vietnam negotiations...</p>
                <p>LORD: And moving ahead with the Russians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, so things were really moving. However, you were
                        alsfleshing out an agenda that President Nixon would be taking with
                        him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's right. As we did for Kissinger trips but obviously also for a trip
                    as important as the Nixon visit, we did a lot of homework to get ready for that.
                    First, we arranged by subject matter excerpts from Kissinger's conversations
                    with Zhou En-lai and other Chinese during his first trip. So in terms of
                    Vietnam, to take one example, we had everything that was said on Vietnam during
                    the 17 hours of our meetings. That material would be excerpted from those
                    conversations and put under that heading. These excerpts would be set out in
                    terms of The Chinese Position and The U.S. Position. We set out goals and
                    talking points and also defenses against Chinese attacks in certain areas. In
                    other words, what's their offense and what's our defense? And vice versa. We did
                    that on all of the issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>We carefully drafted Kissinger's opening statement. We had the transcripts fully
                    recorded both by excerpts and in terms of specific issues. We provided further
                    background material both from CIA as well as from the State Department on
                    Chinese personalities and their positions on various issues, plus the domestic
                    situation in China. We prepared memoranda on Chinese relationships with other
                    countries and what our goals were. Then we drafted a possible communique to be
                    issued at the end of the Nixon visit. So we prepared the talking points and
                    provided background on the various issues that might come up in Kissinger's
                    conversations. We also set out goals for the summit meeting.</p>
                <p>Then there was the whole logistic side, which was managed by Dwight Chapin and
                    others. There would need to be agreements with the Chinese on how many press
                    representatives they wanted to allow. Of course, the Chinese were shocked by the
                    numbers we had in mind. Other matters involved security arrangements and
                    logistics, personnel needs, and issues of this kind. So there was a massive
                    amount of work to be handled.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have assumed that the NSC staff would have been almost overwhelmed by
                    virtually every Embassy in Washington and every Congressional political leader
                    in our own country. They would be asking: “What did you people see in China and
                    what are you doing” to make sure that you make this or that point?</p>
                <p>LORD: I'm sure that this was the case. I don't recall specifically. In my own
                    case I had my hands full with my own in box. My job was basically working with
                    Kissinger and, with him, for President Nixon. Together with John Holdridge and
                    others, I prepared analyses, talking points, and getting ready for the summit
                    meeting. External activity with other countries would have been handled, either
                    by the State Department or by the experts on the NSC staff for the region
                    concerned. So if someone on the NSC staff had to see the Japanese Ambassador,
                    short of Kissinger it would have been John Holdridge, or Sonnenfeldt with a
                    European Ambassador, for example. There was a lot of that contact work going on,
                    but it doesn't stand out vividly in my own mind.</p>
                <p>Most of these contacts were handled by the State Department, which was getting up
                    to speed itself, as well as by the White House. Kissinger was very careful about
                    his staff talking to many people, and certainly not to the press or Members of
                    Congress. So we wouldn't have spent much time dealing with external contacts.
                    Certainly, I didn't. Others may have. However, you're right. There were a lot of
                    queries, questions, and suggestions as to what we ought to do.</p>
                <p>Q: The major issue before you, as you prepared for the Nixon trip, was Taiwan,
                    wasn't it? As you prepared to set up the agenda, in a way you had to be coming
                    up with what answer you wanted. Was there a debate raging within the White House
                    over what was to happen with Taiwan?</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>LORD: Here, again, my memory is not clear, and I don't want to try to be overly
                    precise. We began, of course, since the situation was now public, to draw in the
                    State Department, including experts like Marshall Green, Al Jenkins, and so on.
                    There were also people working with them who, I assume, had been working on
                    China. I realize that they had been working on China at that point for some
                    years. So we began to get previous formulations about what we had said about
                    Taiwan and other issues in Warsaw and Geneva, also drawing from internal
                    position papers. At least now, since this matter was public, we drew very
                    heavily on these resources. We had drawn on these resources before, but always
                    somewhat under false pretenses, at least about the immediate objective.</p>
                <p>Now, of course, the subject was open. President Nixon was going to go to China.
                    Kissinger was going back to China in October, 1971. He took some State
                    Department people with him this time. So we could draw on these sources. These
                    would include formulations on Taiwan. I can't remember exactly how all of this
                    was thrashed out. I was the one who worked primarily with John Holdridge,
                    getting Kissinger ready for the meeting. We had formulations on Taiwan, on the
                    communique to be drafted, and so on.Basically, our approach on Taiwan was going
                    to be trying to square the circle. We had no intention at that point, of course,
                    of switching relations or anything that dramatic. The issue was essentially:
                    “How can we kick this issue down the road?” And leave the Chinese enough face so
                    that they could live with it, not solving this issue, certainly not trying to
                    bite any bullets ourselves. We were very sensitive to the impact on our friends
                    on Taiwan, other allies, and our domestic audience. So we came up with words
                    which would be reassuring to the Chinese but which would not get us into too
                    much trouble.</p>
                <p>Kissinger had given some important assurances to the Chinese on Taiwan in July
                    1971, but then and thereafter our formulations were designed not to undercut
                    Taiwan or our ties with it in any fundamental issue.</p>
                <p>I don't remember any raging debates on Taiwan in our government. I remember that
                    we put together some massive briefing books on this and the other topics.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Even early on, did you have a scenario on how long our
                    process of normalization with China would take and that it wasn't leading to
                    diplomatic relations...</p>
                <p>LORD: Not really. We did not have any precise time tables. My guess is that the
                    general assumption was that we wouldn't bite that bullet of normalization until
                    after the reelection of President Nixon in 1972. That was sufficiently
                    controversial, not to mention the shock to Taiwan and so on, and also the
                    political fallout. So we didn't want to bite that bullet at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>Now, I don't recall whether we ever sat down to the Chinese and said: “We'll do
                    this in President Nixon's second term.” I recall that when President Ford was in
                    office, we made it clear that we would move ahead on normalization of relations
                    with China during Ford's second term, if he was reelected. However, I don't
                    believe that we were ever that precise, even among ourselves, beyond a working
                    assumption that we weren't going to try, nor would the Chinese expect, to be
                    able to pull off full normalization during President Nixon's first four
                    years.</p>
                <p>However, in February, 1973, after one of Kissinger's visits to China, we set up
                    Liaison Offices in the two capitals. This step amounted to de facto embassies
                    and normalization and was a major step forward. It also showed Chinese
                    flexibility, since they had said firmly they would never have an embassy in
                    Washington while the Republic of China was still there.</p>
                <p>That's a good point that you raised. Without being precise about normalization of
                    relations, we did have to figure out how we were going to communicate between
                    China and the United States, since we didn't have Embassies or, at that point,
                    even Liaison Offices. We ended up doing this two ways. One was through General
                    Vernon Walters [the Defense Attache] in our Embassy in Paris. He talked to the
                    ambassador named Huang Chen in the PRC Embassy in Paris, who eventually became
                    Ambassador to the United States. Once the People's Republic of China was
                    admitted to the UN, we communicated through the first PRC Ambassador to the UN,
                    Huang Hua, who subsequently became their Foreign Minister.</p>
                <p>We set up a communications channel through Ambassador Huang Hua in New York.
                    Kissinger and I, or sometimes myself alone or Al Haig, depending on whether we
                    were traveling, would go up to New York and meet Ambassador Huang Hua in a
                    secret apartment, a CIA safe house about two blocks from where my parents lived,
                    and where I had grown up.</p>
                <p>We would have exchanges with the PRC in that apartment, and through Paris,
                    whether it involved looking forward to the next trip or talking about the crisis
                    in Bangladesh which concerned India and Pakistan, for example. We had exchanges
                    with the PRC on such subjects. Or we just generally kept in touch. We had to
                    work out communications, and these were the channels that we used until we
                    agreed to set up Liaison Offices in Beijing and Washington in February,
                    1973.</p>
                <p>We didn't have a precise timetable for normalization of relations. I don't recall
                    the formulas we used about saying to the Chinese that some day we looked forward
                    to having diplomatic relations and full normalization. I'm sure that these
                    references were somewhat guarded and certainly were not specific in terms of a
                    timetable. Even as other issues came up, we had to try to be as careful as we
                    could, whether this involved our troop presence on Taiwan, and so on.</p>
                <p>So, from the beginning, you are absolutely right, Taiwan was the most sensitive
                    issue, obviously, even as we tried to keep in play all of the more positive
                    issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Regarding the agenda, you arrived in Beijing in October,
                        1971.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's correct.</p>
                <p>Q: The Chinese knew that you were coming to Beijing. Did you find that there was
                    a different atmosphere? Did you find that you were dealing with apparatchiks? Or
                    was the atmosphere one of, “Let's get down to business.” Was there any
                    euphoria?</p>
                <p>LORD: No. Three things happened in connection with this trip. First, there was a
                    continuation and a great enrichment in the conversation over a whole range of
                    substantive issues, between Zhou En-lai and Kissinger. There were really
                    remarkable conversations between them. By the way, Kissinger has said that, of
                    all the people he ever met in the diplomatic field in his life, the two most
                    impressive were Zhou En-lai and De Gaulle. Since Kissinger spent infinitely more
                    time with Zhou En-lai than with De Gaulle, he probably would put Zhou En-lai in
                    first place. Maybe De Gaulle would have rivaled that if Kissinger could have
                    spent as much time with him. However, Kissinger has always said that Zhou En-lai
                    was one of the two most impressive people he has met. Kissinger's conversations
                    with Zhou En-lai were always interesting.</p>
                <p>There was a continuing process of feeling out by each side as to where our
                    strategic goals could converge and how we could handle difficult issues. That
                    was one aspect of the Kissinger trip and an end in itself, with Kissinger going
                    back and talking to the Chinese.</p>
                <p>Then there were the two goals of setting up President Nixon's trip to China. On
                    the substantive side, and related to the one I just mentioned, we were beginning
                    to see what the leaders would say on these issues when they met, together with
                    mine fields to be avoided and areas of possible convergence to be explored.
                    Specifically, and I'll get back to this, there was the communique, which turned
                    out to be The Shanghai Communique. This would be the concrete result of the
                    Nixon visit and obviously very important. Further, there were the logistic
                    preparations on where the President would go and what he would do. If you like,
                    I could discuss both the communique process and the public process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Let me discuss the public process first. I don't recall how much of this
                    was fixed before we went to China and how much was fixed when we were there. It
                    was agreed that we would arrive in China on February 22, 1972, and remain
                    through February 28, 1972, Chinese time. President Nixon would go first to
                    Beijing, then to Hangzhou for its natural beauty and just to go to another
                    place. Then we would go to Shanghai and leave China from there. There would be
                    roughly a day each in Hangzhou and Shanghai and four or five days in
                    Beijing.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>The way the Chinese handled this, and they were very clever in helping to get
                    ready for the Nixon visit, involved getting their own public used to the fact
                    that the American President was coming after 22 or 23 years of total hostility
                    and isolation. During this time the Chinese Communists had demonized America in
                    their own propaganda. So, although we found out that there was underlying
                    respect and affection for the United States by the Chinese people, despite this
                    propaganda, and which was quite remarkable, nevertheless, both in terms of high
                    ranking cadre and even some of the Chinese leaders, and in terms of the general
                    public, the Chinese had their own need to begin to condition the Chinese
                    audience as to what was coming. This renewal of contact was a shock for us, but
                    it certainly was quite a turnaround for the Chinese, as well. So, in effect, we
                    did a dress rehearsal, wherein Kissinger and the rest of us would go to places
                    that President Nixon would be going to, both to check them out, but also
                    gradually to reach wider Chinese audiences.</p>
                <p>The most restrictive were the private meetings with Zhou En-lai with a handful on
                    each side. Then there were broader meetings with more people on each side,
                    substantive and logistic. We went to see a cultural performance of some sort,
                    even on that trip, to which high Chinese cadre were invited. So the next circle
                    of people we saw and were seen by consisted of fairly high level party officials
                    who had been specially invited and were exposed to Kissinger and us. Then we
                    went to the Summer Palace and the lake, which is a famous tourist attraction,
                    including for ordinary Chinese citizens. So we were there, not only checking out
                    this site for President Nixon but also exposing the Chinese people to the
                    Americans and the fact that Nixon was coming. We went to these places, both to
                    check out the logistics, the security, the attractiveness, the symbolism, and
                    the photo opportunities, but also to begin to condition widening circles of the
                    Chinese people that Americans were coming and that this was to be accepted, and
                    so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that there was rather intensive, TV coverage of
                        all othis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: For the trip in October, 1971, I don't believe so. This is partly because
                    the Chinese weren't physically set up with satellite TV, as we were later on for
                    President Nixon's trip, and partly because Nixon, with his ego, didn't want his
                    thunder stolen. So I don't believe that there was TV coverage on the October
                    Kissinger trip, or Haig's trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I meant internally, in China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No, I don't believe so even then, either. The Chinese didn't have much
                    television. For example, and I just saw this figure the other day, as late as
                    1978 or 1979, which is, after all, five or six years after our first trip,
                    something like 10 million Chinese had access to television. I'm not talking
                    about 10 million TV sets, but access to television. Today, the figure for access
                    to TV is over a billion Chinese. So you can see how far they've gone.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>I don't know how much press coverage there was of the October Kissinger trip to
                    China. We may not have had any press with us. President Nixon would have been
                    very annoyed, had we had much press with us. Kissinger would have been sensitive
                    to this point. He got enough drama out of his secret trip to China that he
                    wasn't about to upstage Nixon by getting all kinds of photo opportunities. You
                    should remember that it wasn't just us there at this time. There were also
                    Dwight Chapin, the security people, and Ron Ziegler, the press spokesman. They'd
                    make sure that President Nixon wasn't going to be upstaged.</p>
                <p>We checked all of those sites out. We did not go to Hangzhou and Shanghai. We
                    stayed in Beijing. We managed pretty much to put together the arrangements for
                    the trip. There was a lot of haggling, I'm sure, as there always is,
                    particularly with the Chinese. But it's also true with the Russians and others.
                    There is the question of security and whose security officers are going to ride
                    in whose car. Nixon had to use Chinese cars, and the Secret Service people
                    resisted that. As far as the press arrangements were concerned, the Chinese
                    probably expected a few score press people, at the most. The Nixon press people
                    asked for credentials for 200 press, or whatever the figure was. The Chinese
                    just gasped.However, the Chinese were quite forthcoming, certainly on the media
                    coverage. They probably saw that this was to their advantage, despite their
                    nervousness and being totally aghast at the number of journalists who would be
                    coming for the Nixon visit. Regarding the entourage of the American President,
                    the Chinese were relatively forthcoming. Kissinger used to joke that the
                    cultural shock was extraordinary when the Chinese talked to the advance party
                    about publicity.</p>
                <p>Among other things which probably was done on this trip, or maybe on Haig's trip,
                    was that Kissinger laid the groundwork for the President and him to meet with
                    Zhou En-lai and others to discuss the political issues, including the
                    particularly sensitive issue of Taiwan, and the communique. Meanwhile, the
                    Foreign Ministers, William Rogers [Secretary of State] and his Chinese
                    counterpart, Ji Peng-fei would deal with things like trade, cultural exchanges,
                    blocked assets, and economic and other bilateral issues. This was arranged so
                    that they would have parallel conversations and keep the State Department out of
                    really important negotiations. This was nothing that anybody was proud of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Mao Zedong a factor in any of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No. We didn't expect to see him in October. Again, that would be upstaging
                    President Nixon. Mao really only saw national leaders. He was a factor, and I'll
                    get to the communique in just a minute. He was a factor on that. Zhou En-lai was
                    always deferential to Mao and would always invoke him. So, in the course of
                    conversations Mao's name would come up. We were sure that, for something of this
                    magnitude, anything major would be approved by Mao. However, we didn't see him,
                    and he wasn't directly involved. I am sure that Zhou En-lai was keeping him
                    posted as we went along. So I think that that covers the logistics of the visit,
                    as far as I can recall.</p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>Q: Was Deng Xiaoping involved?</p>
                <p>LORD: No. At that point, no. He made a couple of comebacks, but at that point we
                    had never heard of him. I know that. At that time he probably would have been in
                    one of his down periods and still hadn't recovered from the Cultural Revolution
                    as yet. You have to remember that the Cultural Revolution went on until 1976.
                    People really started to be rehabilitated in 1977-1978. Deng went up, went back
                    down, and went up again. We didn't meet Deng for the first time until he led a
                    delegation to the UN in New York in 1974.</p>
                <p>Are there any other questions on logistics? I can get to the communique and the
                    substance, but I think that's about all I can remember about logistics.</p>
                <p>There were quite interesting aspects with regard to the communique. We had in
                    mind a rather typical communique, in which we would try to get in there as many
                    points of convergence, agreement, and parallel policy as possible. Even if we
                    had to stretch it, given the fact that the two countries had been isolated from
                    each other and mutually hostile, and we agreed on almost no issues on the
                    international scene. In the course of our conversations with Zhou En-lai we
                    handed him a draft communique.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're still talking about the trip in October, 1971.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. The whole idea was to get as much as possible in the communique
                    negotiated on that trip, so we wouldn't leave it until the last minute and under
                    the pressure of the summit meeting in February, 1972, and last minute deadlines.
                    So we wanted to try to get the communique squared away. Ideally, we would have
                    liked to have everything negotiated. As I will describe, we ended up getting the
                    great bulk of it done, except for the Taiwan issue, where we made some progress
                    but still had some outstanding problem areas, which had to be negotiated at the
                    summit meeting.</p>
                <p>So, of course, we had this rather well-done, standard, diplomatic communique
                    covering a lot of issues and suggesting that the meeting was very friendly,
                    marked by convergent perspectives, but without being stupid about it, or going
                    overboard.</p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>At the next meeting it was obvious that Zhou En-lai had checked with Mao. He came
                    back and just tore into us with revolutionary fervor, in effect stating that we
                    had given him an amateurish and ill-advised draft communique which was basically
                    useless. I'm not trying to reflect what Zhou En-lai said in a verbatim way, but
                    what he said, in effect, was that we had fought against each other in Korea, the
                    U.S. had intervened on the Taiwan question, and we disagreed on many world
                    issues. He said that the U.S. had some allies, and China had some allies. We had
                    totally different social systems and views of the world. We had gone through 22
                    years of mutual hostility and isolation. He said that your people, our people,
                    and our mutual friends around the world are not going to understand this kind of
                    communique, which suggests that we are like two, normal countries getting
                    together for a regular, summit meeting. He said that this is absurd.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, and I don't know that he put it this way, but the sub-current of his
                    remarks would be that some of our respective allies are going to be nervous. If
                    we are this friendly, this might mean that we are selling them out. In addition,
                    he said that the description of the world situation in the draft communique
                    wasn't sufficiently revolutionary from his standpoint. He indicated that it was
                    in a bourgeois pattern, and so on. So he said that the whole draft lacked
                    credibility, candor, and, furthermore, couldn't be defended by the Chinese
                    ideologically, in their own party circles, with their own people, and with their
                    friends. By implication he suggested that we might have some of the same
                    problems that certainly the Chinese had. As far as China was concerned, there
                    was turmoil under the heavens, and we shouldn't pretend that there weren't
                    significant differences. He went on for some time, just ripping us apart.</p>
                <p>Instead, he suggested, and this was at his initiative, that we have a different
                    kind of communique, which was unprecedented in diplomatic practice, in which
                    each side would state its own position. He said that in those areas where we do
                    have some agreement or some parallel interest we can state those as well.
                    However, he seemed to be saying that, having set out our differences, we would
                    each have protected our domestic flanks, relationships with our friends and
                    allies, and made more credible those areas of agreement when we stated them,
                    because we had been honest enough in the rest of the communique to make the
                    points. We had been separated, we had been hostile to each other, and we had
                    these continuing differences. So when we get to agreements, people will believe
                    us because they have seen our candor beforehand.</p>
                <p>Frankly, this was a brilliant idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>LORD: It was unprecedented. I don't know of any other communique quite like the
                    Shanghai Communique. The fact is, not only is it invoked routinely and so on, it
                    still is a governing document in some ways. I don't believe that I can think of
                    another such statement, lasting so long in significance. I'm not speaking of
                    something like the Treaty of Versailles ending wars. However, in terms of a
                    summit meeting, I can't recall any summit communique in history which has lasted
                    this long, still having some significance and being invoked by both sides
                    continually and being recognized by the public. This is because of the
                    unprecedented nature of it.</p>
                <p>So we had our work cut out for us because, by this time, we only had about two or
                    three more days left in China. Indeed, we may have extended our trip by a day or
                    two in order to negotiate the draft communique. This may have led to this
                    terrible timing at the UN in connection with the Chinese representation
                    issue.</p>
                <p>Kissinger and I went back to the guesthouse. I don't recall whether we
                    immediately saw the wisdom in this approach or not, but we had no choice in any
                    event. Certainly, Kissinger soon saw it, as did I, but at first we were
                    disappointed that we weren't going to have some nice document that would record
                    the major achievements at this forthcoming summit meeting. We were a little bit
                    worried about justifying this visit to our domestic, U.S. audience. But I think
                    that we fairly quickly saw the wisdom of the approach which Zhou En-lai had
                    advocated.</p>
                <p>After we went back to the guesthouse, we spent a frantic night, although we spent
                    some more frantic nights during the negotiations on Vietnam. We proceeded to
                    take the draft communique which we had received from the Chinese. I can't
                    remember whether they gave us a full draft of the communique. Certainly, they
                    didn't set forth our positions. However, they set forth their position, on the
                    world in general, ideology, revolution, and whether justice is more important
                    than stability in dealing with the strivings of the poor around the world. Then
                    the Chinese described their friendship with Vietnam, with Pakistan, their
                    backing of the Arabs, and their backing of North Korea, etc, and their related
                    positions on key issues. They mentioned all of these things where we more or
                    less disagreed, certainly in philosophy and ideology. They probably included one
                    or two sentences that the two sides hoped to improve bilateral relations, or
                    something like that.</p>
                <p>So we had a challenge of how to accept the Chinese approach. I think that we
                    recognized, to a certain extent, that it was probably a good idea. However, at
                    that point, given the time pressures and the fiery nature of the Chinese
                    rhetoric in their draft, we were pretty concerned. We would never admit to
                    panic, but we were under pressure. We worked in shifts in dealing with this
                    task.</p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>Kissinger went to bed first. I can't give you the exact time. I would say that it
                    was at about 10:00 or 11:00 PM. I spent the next few hours doing a redraft of
                    the Chinese draft communique. In doing this I tried to accomplish three things.
                    Tone down the Chinese rhetoric. This was somewhat presumptuous - trying to tell
                    them what they could say. We said to them that they could very well stand firmly
                    for their positions, but it was not in their interest to excite our own,
                    domestic audience. This would tend to undercut the President's initiative. There
                    needed to be some restraint in the fire eating rhetoric contained in the Chinese
                    draft communique. We needed to tone down their draft because what sounds like
                    natural rhetoric to them sounds pretty polemical and hair-raising in American
                    ears. So one of the parts of our redraft was to take the Chinese positions and
                    try to tone them down, without overdoing it in terms of our chutzpah, because,
                    after all, it's their view of the world, not ours.</p>
                <p>Then I set out to state our positions. We decided to do this firmly and honestly,
                    both to balance the Chinese position to a certain extent, to reassure our
                    friends and allies where that was appropriate, to be firm as a matter of general
                    principle, and also to deal with our domestic audience so that it would look as
                    if we were firm as well. We would not, however, employ the kind of rhetoric that
                    the Chinese communists did. So, setting forth our positions would consist of
                    both of us surveying the international scene, ideology, and so on. We also put
                    in principles of international relations on which we felt we could agree, even
                    if we could not agree on the analysis of whether revolution was afoot or whether
                    justice was to prevail over stability. We, the Chinese and the United States,
                    put in several principles, such as non-interference, which they liked, and the
                    view that both sides oppose hegemony, which was a code word for the Russian
                    threat. We liked this, and they liked it as well. It was the single most
                    important agreement in the communique. Neither Moscow nor the world missed it.
                    There were some other principles added to this. Then there were contrasting
                    statements on specific international issues, such as the ones I mentioned.</p>
                <p>Then we had to have language on Taiwan. The Chinese had set forth their position,
                    so we had to set forth our position, maybe finding some areas where we could
                    agree on Taiwan.</p>
                <p>Finally, toward the end, we needed to beef up bilateral areas where we already
                    converged and where we could make progress. So we beefed up things like looking
                    forward to an exchange of persons and more economic exchanges. And so we
                    prepared this redraft of the communique. I'm not sure we put all this in during
                    the first draft but we at least headed in these directions.</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>This is the kind of material I was working on. Then, about 3:00 AM, I woke
                    Kissinger up and gave him my redraft of the communique. I went to bed until 6:00
                    or 7:00 AM. During this time he redrafted what I had prepared. Then we went back
                    to the Chinese that morning. We gave them our counter-draft, and then both sides
                    kept preparing counter-drafts. We made considerable progress in terms of most of
                    what became known as the Shanghai Communique, except on Taiwan, where we still
                    had significant differences on which we couldn't close the gap, although we
                    would like to have done this.</p>
                <p>By the time we left China, in terms of the communique, we had about 80 to 85
                    percent of the communique done, including pretty much what they were going to
                    say on these issues up front, internationally and on specific issues, and what
                    we were going to say. I think that we had agreement on most of these
                    international principles. There were four or five of them, including the one on
                    hegemony. Although we still wanted to beef up bilateral cooperation in future,
                    positive directions, we had at least some of that in the draft. However, there
                    was still a considerable gap on Taiwan. So that's where we were as we left.</p>
                <p>Q: On the technical side, who was looking at the language on both sides? Were the
                    Chinese looking at the English language and you looking at the Chinese text?</p>
                <p>LORD: That's a very good point. Frankly, we relied on their interpreters in the
                    conversations. As I mentioned, Nancy Tang had been on the plane from Pakistan.
                    She had also done some interpreting for Mao. Ji Zhao-chu was actually Mao's
                    interpreter in the interview with Edgar Snow and had been an interpreter as a
                    young man. He had attended Harvard University. He was also a key interpreter in
                    this context. Tang and Ji did the checking on the Chinese side, obviously
                    translating it for the Chinese leadership, as well as sending it up to the
                    Politburo and Mao, or whoever was reviewing it.</p>
                <p>We just worked in the English language. John Holdridge spoke Chinese but not, I
                    believe, well enough to be precise. I'm sure that when we got back to
                    Washington, we checked out the texts with our expert translators and
                    interpreters, in terms of precision in Chinese. You are right. We had to make
                    sure that the Chinese language version matched our English language version.</p>
                <p>It was our general experience that, unlike the case with the Russians, the
                    Chinese were fair on translation matters. In their translations they wouldn't
                    try to sneak in a Chinese word that was more to their advantage than what we
                    meant in English. Sometimes, you have two or three choices. You can take this
                    word or that word. The Russians could always be counted on to take anything that
                    they could find in the dictionary that would serve their cause, even if it was a
                    real stretch of what both sides genuinely meant. In this way they were picking
                    up loose change all the time. This is one reason why Kissinger began to prefer
                    dealing with the Chinese, rather than with the Russians. This was partly because
                    the Chinese were always fair on translation issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>For example, in the Shanghai Communique, after we issued it, and we more closely
                    examined what they had done after we got back to Washington, we found a few
                    instances where the translation of a given phrase could have gone either way.
                    They actually gave us a word that was more favorable to us than it might have
                    been.</p>
                <p>The other reason that Kissinger preferred dealing with the Chinese was that they
                    were more up front about their basic position. When you got a position from
                    them, it was pretty close to their bottom line, even from the beginning, rather
                    than inflated, as was the case with the Russians. As I said earlier, you never
                    knew where the Russians' bottom line was. You always had to slice down to reach
                    it, which means that you, yourself, have to pad your own position. We preferred
                    the Chinese, principled approach.</p>
                <p>So, on the issue of language, we were pretty much at their mercy, but this didn't
                    turn out to be a problem. There was no problem in the conversations, because
                    several people on the Chinese side understood English, and John Holdridge knew
                    enough Chinese to double check anything that we needed. The Chinese really had
                    no incentive to distort the translations. Zhou En-lai himself understood some
                    English. He would often laugh at Kissinger's jokes before they were
                    translated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: What was the reason for not taking
                        youown translators and interpreters with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: By then the trip was public knowledge. In the first place we didn't have
                    too much talent, certainly in the U.S. Government. I guess that Chas Freeman was
                    about as good as you could get at that point, but he certainly wasn't up to the
                    Chinese standard. However, it was mostly a matter of Kissinger not wanting to
                    have extraneous people around for sensitive discussions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when you got back to Washington with the Shanghai
                        Communique...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: It was an advanced draft of the communique. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that you had accomplished a great
                        deal.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>LORD: We had accomplished a great deal in terms of the communique. I think that
                    we began to see more clearly why this was a good, though unconventional
                    approach. I remember that we were also still concerned about the Taiwan issue.
                    Obviously, it was so sensitive to both sides and very sensitive in terms of the
                    President's domestic support for this opening to China. So we knew that we had a
                    lot of work already done on that, but we also did a lot of homework over the
                    next few weeks, trying to figure out how to bridge the gap.</p>
                <p>Al Haig went back to China in January, 1972, primarily to pin down the logistics
                    of the Nixon trip. He worked with the advance security and public relations
                    people. I think he also tried to make further progress on some aspects of the
                    communique, but I don't recall that he made much progress on it. However, he did
                    a good job with the logistics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you returned to Washington in the fall of 1971.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's right. We had the embarrassment of the UN defeat on the Chinese
                    representation issue as we were flying home. We had gotten on the plane, quite
                    excited on the progress we had made for the Nixon trip. Then we had this
                    immediate downer and shock of the UN vote.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The UN vote being...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: The People's Republic of China was admitted to the UN and Taiwan was kicked
                    out. Obviously, we knew in our heart of hearts that was probably coming soon. We
                    fought hard to keep Taiwan in, together with China, without success. To have it
                    come just as we were leaving China was really quite embarrassing to Kissinger
                    and Nixon.</p>
                <p>Q: Why were we making a stand on this, because we had been fighting on this issue
                    for a long time? This had been a sort of major occupation of the Foreign Service
                    for 20 years or more. We tried to get all of these countries to vote for Taiwan
                    and against Communist China. We had expended tremendous, diplomatic capital on
                    it, but as soon as we began to open up to China, we must have known that, in
                    effect, we were trying to hold back the sea.</p>
                <p>LORD: Of course, we knew. What we tried to do was to promote a two China
                    approach, even though we did not recognize the PRC officially, in an effort to
                    allow Taiwan to keep its seat in the UN. I can't remember whether we opposed
                    Beijing getting into the UN at all or whether we were saying that if the PRC
                    gets in, Taiwan should also remain a member.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: This was called “dual
                        representation.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes, dual representation. However, getting back to the incentives to the
                    Chinese to move with us, one of them was to get into the UN. They knew that this
                    would be part of the fallout of their breaking out of their isolation and
                    establishing relations with other countries. So we honestly lost all of our
                    leverage with the July Kissinger visit, and it was inevitable that the PRC would
                    be admitted to the UN. The Chinese hung tough on the point that Taiwan had to
                    leave the UN. So I think that we knew that the PRC would be admitted, but the
                    real issue was whether some honor and credibility could be preserved for our
                    domestic position for this initiative by keeping Taiwan in the UN as well. This
                    would certainly mitigate the blow. The UN vote was not only on admitting the
                    People's Republic of China but making clear that there couldn't be dual
                    representation of China and that Taiwan had to get out of the UN.</p>
                <p>There were some ironic overtones in that outcome for my family. My father-in-law,
                    Sandys Bao, as I said earlier, represented the Taiwan Sugar Company in the
                    United States. Sugar was Taiwan's major export in those days, though it has
                    since diversified its exports. He was also Taiwan's representative on the
                    International Sugar Council which would meet periodically in London. The council
                    included representatives of all of the major sugar exporting and importing
                    countries and was connected to the UN. So you could argue that I did my
                    father-in-law out of a job. But he hung on in that job, and Taiwan remained a
                    member of the International Sugar Council for what I think was a couple of years
                    after the UN admission of Beijing as a member. This was because of his own
                    capabilities and skills and the fact that he was held in such respect by his
                    fellow delegates. They went out of their way to try to preserve his position.
                    Basically, I cost him one of his jobs.</p>
                <p>The other ironic thing was that when my wife and I were married in 1963, our
                    wedding reception was at Twin Oaks, in Washington, DC, which was the residence
                    of the Chinese Nationalist Ambassador at the time and until 1979. The Chinese
                    Nationalist Ambassador gave us a wedding reception. Then, eight years later, I
                    snuck into China with Kissinger and greatly shocked Taiwan.</p>
                <p>Let me say that my father-in-law fully understood what we had done. In fact, he
                    told me that the opening to China was in the national interest of the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>Q: When you came back to Washington after the first Kissinger trip in 1971, were
                    you pretty well concentrated on the preparations for the Nixon visit during the
                    period from October, 1971, to February, 1972?</p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>LORD: A lot of other things were moving, too. Of course, we were concentrating on
                    preparations for President Nixon's trip to China. However, you have to remember
                    that the pace of contacts with Russia also picked up. I spent nowhere near as
                    much time on Russia as I did on either Vietnam or China. However, I was
                    certainly involved in contacts with Russia. That meant negotiations on the
                    status of Berlin, SALT-1 [Strategic Arms Limitation Talks - 1], and beginning to
                    move toward the holding of a summit meeting in Moscow, as well. Again, these
                    preparations did not take much of my time. I was fully deployed on China and
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>The situation in Vietnam was also moving. I don't have the dates in front of me,
                    but we were still making secret trips to Paris during this period as well. And
                    in a major speech in January 1972, the President revealed our secret
                    negotiations and our forthcoming negotiating position. So it was an extremely
                    busy time. Indeed, the following year and a half was one of the most dramatic
                    times in U.S. diplomatic history and certainly in my personal life, because we
                    had the Beijing Summit Meeting, the Moscow Summit Meeting, the ending of the
                    Vietnam War, and assorted other events in the course of that period.</p>
                <p>However, to return to the China front, first we had to get ready for Al Haig's
                    trip to China in January, 1972, making sure that he was prepared, and working
                    with the White House domestic staff on the logistics, as well as trying to make
                    further efforts on the draft communique for the Nixon trip. I think that Haig
                    also raised Vietnam a great deal, to try to get the Chinese to continue to
                    pressure Hanoi, and so on. So we were preoccupied with that. I recall being in
                    Florida when we were launching Haig right at the time of the Super Bowl. I am a
                    fanatic Redskins fan, and they were in the game. Kissinger gave me about a
                    six-hour drafting assignment about three hours before the kickoff. I did the job
                    in 2 hours, 55 minutes.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, when Haig returned to Washington, we only had a few weeks before
                    President Nixon's trip to China. I was put in charge of the preparations for the
                    President's trip, which meant that I had to orchestrate the whole thing. I had
                    lots of help, of course, particularly from John Holdridge, who was crucial and
                    much more of a China-expert thaI.</p>
                <p>This was the most meticulous process of preparation, as Kissinger has said in his
                    memoirs, which has probably ever been undertaken for a summit eeting, both
                    because it was so important and because of its historical significance. So, as
                    I've already mentioned, we put together six black briefing books about so
                    high.</p>

                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes, six or eight inches thick. These briefing books were filled with
                    everything from Chinese history to Chinese culture and poetry; personal
                    portraits of Mao Zedong, Zhou En-lai, and the other, principal Chinese leaders;
                    all of the transcripts of conversations during our trips in July and October,
                    1971, and Haig's trip in January, 1972, arranged by subject matter as well as
                    the full transcripts on their own; the Chinese positions and objectives on every
                    issue; our positions and objectives on every issue; our offense and defense;
                    further elaborations of the draft Shanghai Communique, particularly with
                    reference to the Taiwan issue; Chinese popular sayings. We had chronicles and
                    excerpts from articles by outsiders.</p>
                <p>We just had an incredible and rich array of material. To this day, and I have
                    worked for several Presidents, I have never seen any President work as hard for
                    a single event or trip as Nixon worked for this trip. As I mentioned earlier,
                    quite literally, there was proof of his having read every page of these briefing
                    books, because there would be his marks and annotations on almost everyone.
                    Often there would be questions and requests for further information. When we
                    finally went to China with Nixon, he kept asking on the airplane, as we flew
                    toward China, for more information. This resulted in a good performance by
                    President Nixon with Zhou En-lai, Mao, and the other Chinese leaders.</p>
                <p>Q: You were talking about the preparations for this Summit Meeting in China. I
                    don't know how it was then, but now one has the feeling that when a Summit
                    Meeting comes up, the major preparation on the White House side is for photo
                    opportunities. The public relations people almost take over. They are concerned
                    about the time of day the television coverage will be available, headlines,
                    backgrounds, and all of that. Were they melded into your preparations?</p>
                <p>LORD: Certainly. There was the major focus on substance - this was after all a
                    truly historic event and exhaustive talks were held during the trip. But the
                    public impact in the US, China, and the world was key and integral to the
                    substance, so the public dimension was clearly a key part of the trip, which was
                    heavily televised. It had a tremendous impact back here in the United States. In
                    fact, this coverage led to the almost instant romance and euphoria that was
                    overstated. After all, horrible things were still going on in China. We swung
                    from one extreme to another, from picturing China as an implacable enemy to a
                    new friend, so to speak. This reflected somewhat a sort of built-in respect and
                    affection for the Chinese people, and also an appreciation for its geopolitical
                    and historical significance.</p>
                <p>Q: This goes back to the beginning of the United States as a republic. I have a
                    history of the United States Consular Service. We couldn't get consuls in places
                    like Germany and such countries. However, back in 1790 or so Congress
                    immediately approved the appointment of a Consul to go to Canton. China and the
                    China trade have always...</p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>LORD: That's right. There has always been a genuine liking for the Chinese
                    people, a sense of this huge market, as well as the Christian missionary
                    connection. This feeling has been reciprocated on the Chinese people's side, as
                    we found during our first public trip in October, 1971. The Chinese were amazed
                    and stunned at the sight of these Americans walking around. However, they were
                    certainly friendly and not hostile. It was clear, as we went along, that the
                    Chinese people, despite all of the years of propaganda and enmity, genuinely
                    liked Americans. Partly by comparison with all of their other neighbors.</p>
                <p>In the case of Japan, even the young Chinese who hadn't experienced World War II
                    had heard stories about the Rape of Nanking, and so on. There was a clear
                    dislike and distrust of Japan. Also a real concern about and dislike of the
                    Russians, as we learned more and more since then. The Chinese have expressed to
                    us their distrust of the Vietnamese. This was also true of their attitude toward
                    the Indians and, to a certain extent, the Koreans. So, as the Chinese looked
                    around their periphery, these feelings were evident. And they didn't like the
                    Europeans, and particularly the British, because of the history of the Opium War
                    [1839-1842], in addition to other depredations by Germany and so on. So, even
                    though the U.S. may not have had a perfect record in our relations with China,
                    we certainly looked more benign and friendly than others.</p>
                <p>So, on both Chinese and U.S. sides, there was a generally positive feeling. Of
                    course, Chinese public opinion was under tight control and supervision there. I
                    think that it's fair to say that the Chinese public welcomed this opening of
                    relations. There was undoubtedly debate about the opening to the U.S., maybe
                    among the Gang of Four, and perhaps Madame Mao and Lin Biao didn't like all of
                    this. There may have been some debate at the highest levels of the Chinese
                    leadership.</p>
                <p>In the U.S., in turn, there was a tremendous outpouring of affection for China.
                    Part of our problem is that we haven't had a steady gaze toward China. American
                    emotions have run the gamut from the evil Fu Manchu to the noble peasant
                    depicted by Pearl Buck. If we just take American attitudes from the last 50 or
                    60 years, our perceptions have ranged from regarding the Chinese as staunch
                    allies in World War II to enemies, starting in 1949, when Mao Zedong took over
                    the country, or the Korean War, when we wound up fighting each other. We were
                    appropriately horrified at the Great Leap Forward, the ensuing famine, and the
                    Cultural Revolution. Then, suddenly, now there was this opening to China, the
                    tremendous romance and euphoria, and the feeling that we are going to be friends
                    again. Subsequently, Deng Xiaoping came along with capitalism and the view that
                    the Chinese were going to become market economists just like us.</p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>Then, in the 1970s, we began to hear stories about the Cultural Revolution as we
                    had more journalists more or less permanently stationed in China and began to
                    see the warts as we began to have a more normal relationship with that country.
                    In the later 1980s, the relationship was at its most positive though the bad
                    dimensions of the Chinese system were clear. Then there was the Tiananmen Square
                    massacre [in 1989] and the image of the man in front of the Chinese tank, and we
                    went back to a negative perception of China again. Also, the Soviet threat, key
                    to our ties, disappeared. Now we are slowly moving back again, with somewhat
                    more mixed feelings. At one point the Chinese were referred to as yellow hordes,
                    Red Guards, and blue ants. Now they are capitalist men and women. So there have
                    been these great swings in American perceptions of China.</p>
                <p>Certainly, at the time of the beginning of the opening to China, including the
                    Kissinger and Nixon trips, the reportage out of China was pretty positive and
                    euphoric. People were sort of swept up in this. There were few people who were
                    negative. Certainly, Bill Buckley [conservative columnist and publisher] was one
                    of those who went to China and returned with clear reservations. Marilyn Berger
                    of the “Washington Post” was skeptical. They began looking beneath the surface
                    in China. But almost everyone else was swept up in this euphoria.</p>
                <p>That was a very windy response to your question about the preparations for the
                    Nixon visit. Of course, a lot of preparations were made, including arrangements
                    for the press and photo opportunities. However, those preparations were
                    essentially made on theother side of the White House. We were concerned with the
                    substance of the Nixon visit.</p>
                <p>At times Nixon, Kissinger, Haldeman, Chapin, and Ron Ziegler might have debates.
                    Kissinger would always be worried about being crude with the Chinese. After all,
                    we were visiting their country, and should we be rearranging their furniture?
                    (This was literally done once in Canada in Prime Minister Trudeau's office.) We
                    needed to have some sensitivity toward China's own culture, as China was the
                    host for the Nixon visit. Of course, the President's advisers on the public
                    relations and political side were much more concerned about the images and
                    popularity at home of the President. So there was always that kind of tension.
                    However, it worked out very well.</p>
                <p>We, of course, were focused on the communique and the substantive issues and how
                    we would handle relations with other countries which were watching this trip as
                    it developed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling that Nixon was trapping himself,
                        not so much in a contest, but in a display of his intellectual virtuosity in
                        dealing with Zhou En-lai? He had heard about how great this man was and he
                        may have wanted to show, by God, that dealing with him was part of Nixon's
                        makeup. Do you think that was a factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>LORD: I think that that was an element. I mean, any of us, as human beings, when
                    we go up against a heavyweight, want to do our best. So I'm sure that there was
                    that element. However, in all fairness, I think that during those early years of
                    his administration, particularly before the Watergate Affair began to preoccupy
                    Nixon, he prepared very carefully for the major meetings that I also attended,
                    including the Russian summit meeting. In effect, Nixon would commit to memory
                    his basic positions. He liked to talk without notes, whenever possible, to
                    impress people. So this tendency was really carried to a super level on this
                    historic trip. Nixon was very careful in getting ready for these meetings. He
                    really did his homework. Foreign policy issues were his primary passion, even
                    though he became concerned more with the domestic front. People now realize this
                    more clearly than they gave him credit for at the time. He was actually quite
                    progressive on many domestic issues.</p>
                <p>So there was that element of ego in Nixon's makeup. He knew, from Kissinger's
                    recounting of his conversations with Zhou En-lai, that this was a formidable
                    interlocutor and that he had to be up to that. However, this was also an
                    historic trip, and it was very important to Nixon in terms of substance, in
                    gaining Chinese confidence, in projecting firmness, inducing them to cooperate,
                    and pointing out the advantages of cooperation.</p>
                <p>In addition to substance, Nixon also wanted to have a good sense of Chinese
                    culture and history, what he could say in his toasts, how he could work in
                    little Chinese sayings and poetry in his toasts and in some of his remarks at
                    the various meetings. And Nixon was genuinely interested in China, as most
                    Americans are. He wanted to learn more about China himself.So Nixon had all of
                    these incentives, in addition to the historical and geopolitical significance of
                    it. Furthermore, he knew that, although the meetings would be off the record, he
                    nevertheless would be watched with tremendous attention on the world stage,
                    including American television.</p>
                <p>However, all of this preparation didn't do the President much good when he got to
                    the Great Wall. I can't say that I blame him. There he was at the Great Wall,
                    and the press came up to him and said: “What's your reaction to this?” He
                    answered: “It surely is a Great Wall,” and that's about all he could come up
                    with after all of his preparation for this visit. That was the only - and very
                    minor - incident where Nixon did not perform splendidly.</p>
                <p>Q: On the domestic side, what were you getting from your wife and your wife's
                    family? We were going through a sort of euphoric time in terms of relations
                    between the United States and China. Were you getting advice from the pillow,
                    “Don't trust these people?” What were you getting?</p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>LORD: No, not at all. First, as far as my wife was concerned, it was very
                    exciting that the Nixon visit to China had taken place. She recognized that it
                    was in the U.S. national interest. She felt some pride and excitement that I was
                    personally and directly involved in this. She had a sense of irony that a person
                    like me, who was directly involved, had a Chinese wife. She had, of course, a
                    real feeling of love and respect for the Chinese people and a willingness and
                    desire to overcome a feeling of isolation from the Chinese people, including her
                    relatives in China. So all of these feelings were basically very positive.</p>
                <p>The same thing was true of my parents-in-law, even though the Nixon visit had a
                    direct impact on my father-in-law. He was working indirectly for the Taiwan
                    Government. It's hard to exaggerate how responsible he was in his comments to
                    me. There never was any sense of “Why did you do this” or, “How dare you?” In
                    effect, it was just the opposite. He said to me, although he wouldn't want to be
                    quoted in Taipei at the time, “I fully recognize that this trip is in the
                    American national interest.” So the opening had no impact in our family except
                    excitement. Even my in-laws were excited that I was involved in this event.
                    There was absolutely no problem in that connection. Of course my wife was very
                    helpful to me - and Kissinger at times - in interpreting Chinese culture,
                    history, and style. And she was aghast about the political system. She also was
                    the only person I remember predicting Deng Xiao-ping's come-back in 1974-75.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: What about the China Lobby?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: You have to remember that the NSC staff, and particularly myself, in my
                    position as a Special Assistant to Kissinger and being responsible for this
                    particular portfolio, had very little contact with the outside world.</p>
                <p>I rarely got out of the damned office. Sometimes I attended dinner parties, for
                    example, in the Georgetown area of Washington, including with Kissinger and, I
                    would see, some of the movers and shakers in social settings. But I would always
                    be late. I had no contact with the Congress, no contact with the press, no
                    contact with foreign diplomats unless I was sitting in on a meeting, for
                    example, with Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin or going up to New York with Kissinger
                    for a UN contact. So I wasn't personally exposed to this. I don't recall any
                    tremendous pressures from the right wing, or China lobby. I'm sure that there
                    was some concern expressed to Nixon and Kissinger. Certainly, the overwhelming
                    reaction from the media was positive, as was the overwhelming reaction from
                    everywhere. American public opinion and Congress were an easier sell politically
                    than, we thought would be the case.</p>
                <p>I'm sure that Nixon, in particular, was somewhat nervous about public reactions
                    as we went along including his conservative base. This initiative did take some
                    courage. I'm sure that Nixon was pleasantly surprised at how limited the
                    negative reaction was. At least, that's my clear recollection.</p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: In your position on the NSC staff you were talking
                    about being protected or isolated from the outside world. Do you think that that
                    was a good or a bad thing?</p>
                <p>LORD: Given the office hours I kept, this lack of outside contact probably was
                    inevitable in any event. It also fit in with Kissinger's style. However, it also
                    was a reflection of the fact that I was a Special Assistant to Kissinger. The
                    quick answer is that this situation was probably bad. It would have been better
                    to be exposed to the outside world, including Members of Congress, foreign
                    diplomats, the general public, and even the press, to ensure that I wasn't so
                    insulated. Having said that, I must say that I had so much to do that I wouldn't
                    have had much time for such contacts.</p>
                <p>Secondly, I had more sensitive information than anyone else in the NSC staff,
                    except for Al Haig and Kissinger, since I was involved in all of these
                    initiatives. I'm not saying that other NSC staff members didn't have as much
                    information on particular issues, but nobody else had this kind of information
                    on all of the issues. So there was that factor.</p>
                <p>However, to deal with outsiders, we had NSC staff people for specific countries
                    or regions. They would have their own clients. So the European expert on the NSC
                    staff would meet with a European diplomat or businessman, etc. I wasn't involved
                    in that because I was a Special Assistant to Henry Kissinger. So for all of
                    these reasons I was insulated from such contacts. I think that it would have
                    been better if I had been more exposed to such contacts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shall we move on to how the visit went and all of
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: As I look back on my career, I think that the secret trip was in first
                    place in terms of drama. The Kissinger trip to China in July, 1971, was secret
                    and it was the first such trip, I had a Chinese wife, and so forth.</p>
                <p>The Nixon trip has to be up there, probably tied for second place, if not in
                    second place. Certainly, the trip which brought peace to Vietnam is also up
                    there, and would be in second or third place. Then, next would be the Moscow
                    summit meeting, in fourth place.</p>
                <p>The Nixon trip to China was obviously a tremendous event. I run out of adjectives
                    in describing its drama. There was a big buildup to it, and we started it going.
                    It was massively busy getting ready for it, of course, for all of the reasons
                    that I've mentioned.</p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>We got on the President's plane. I can't remember how we moved from my office to
                    the airport. At one point we were on the South Lawn of the White House.
                    President Nixon took off on a helicopter. I remember being with my kids and my
                    wife. I thought that it was on that trip that we were waving goodbye to the
                    helicopter. But how I got to the plane in time is a mystery. Something is
                    screwed up in my recollection of it.</p>
                <p>I remember getting on the plane at Andrews Air Force Base. There was a TV on the
                    plane, which we were watching from right outside the President's cabin, in the
                    senior staff quarters. On the TV people were saying goodbye to the President and
                    us taking off from Andrews Air Force Base. As we took off, we still were
                    watching it on television. I was saying: “If this plane explodes, we can see
                    ourselves explode on television!” This was a case of sick humor.</p>
                <p>In any event, we made two stops: one in Hawaii and one in Guam. On the trip to
                    China with Kissinger in October, 1971, we had stopped off in Hawaii (the Big
                    Island) as well. We stayed at the most beautiful hotel there on Mauna Kea.
                    That's the good news. The bad news is that, by being closer to Kissinger on this
                    trip I got to stay instead in a guest house up in the mountains. I would much
                    rather have been in the hotel, as we were working very hard on the visit.</p>
                <p>As I said, on the way to China we were very busy, revising talking points and
                    getting more information for Nixon. That is all I can remember.</p>
                <p>Q: A technical point. You say that he was going through these huge, briefing
                    books on the plane. You say that Nixon wanted more information.</p>
                <p>LORD: The work continued on the plane. I want to make that poinclear.</p>
                <p>Q: I was thinking of your statement that, during the flight, Nixon wanted more
                    information about this or that, in a plane over the Pacific Ocean. How did you
                    get more information from Washington?</p>
                <p>LORD: We would prepare more elaborate talking points, as opposed to our having to
                    do the research on them ourselves. The people in Washington could give us more
                    positions, I think. If it was more information wanted, there were people on the
                    plane, in addition to myself, who probably knew it right away. But if it was
                    information on the Paris negotiations on Vietnam, we had the briefing book. If
                    it was a matter of Chinese history, culture, or something like that, hopefully
                    someone on the plane knew the answer. I can't recall how well our communications
                    worked with Washington, whether we wired back for more information or not. We
                    certainly did this during our later trips with the President and others.</p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>I don't want to exaggerate this. I'm not saying, for example, that we turned out
                    500 pages of text on the plane. However, continually and throughout the trip,
                    even on the last leg of it, there were requests coming back from the President
                    for more information. I don't recall - as I did in all of my trips with
                    Secretaries of State and other Presidents - that I ever sat around with Nixon
                    and others, kicking around strategy and tactics. I don't recall precisely. There
                    were probably a couple of conversations that I had with the President in the
                    cabin. It was mostly working on papers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Was this when you sat around with
                        Nixoand talked freely about China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: We did that on a few occasions, but not very often. This was partly Nixon's
                    style, perhaps due to his shyness. He probably didn't want a lot of people
                    around him. Certainly, it was part of Kissinger's style. He didn't want to have
                    a lot of the members of his staff with direct access to Nixon.</p>
                <p>Once or twice I went up to Camp David [in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland],
                    when I sat around with Kissinger and Nixon. There were other times when he
                    handled matters differently. Unlike subsequent Presidents and Secretaries of
                    State with whom I have worked, I don't have any recollection of a lot of
                    strategy sessions or directly briefing Nixon, and so on. I want to make clear
                    that Nixon was always friendly and cordial to me. I'm sure that I've already
                    mentioned this, but basically we were isolated from the domestic side of the
                    White House. However, during the October, 1971, trip, and the Presidential trip,
                    we tended to converge a lot more. So too on the Moscow trip.</p>
                <p>However, we always sort of felt that we were being treated as second class
                    citizens by the White House staff. As I said previously, we were never admitted
                    to the White House mess and didn't have parking privileges. I don't think that
                    Kissinger made any heroic efforts to get us into the White House mess or have us
                    mingle with the domestic side of the White House. Looking back on it, given
                    Watergate and everything else, it's just as well that we were pretty well
                    isolated. But I would have liked White House mess access on all those late
                    nights in the West Wing basement.</p>
                <p>So, anyway, there was a great sense of drama when we went to China with Nixon. I
                    remember that when we landed at Beijing Airport, maybe naively I was somewhat
                    disappointed at what I considered the strained nature of the Chinese reception.
                    We had expected thousands of people in cheering crowds, after 22 years of
                    hostilities. There was a very small crowd, including a Chinese Army honor guard.
                    Looking out the window at the welcoming ceremony, I thought that it was a fairly
                    grey day, too. This didn't look like a monumental event, as it ought to have
                    been.</p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>Of course, everyone was wondering how the first encounter would go between the
                    President and Zhou En-lai, who was at the airport to meet him. They all
                    remembered that Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had snubbed Zhou En-lai in
                    Geneva in the 1950s when he refused to shake his hand. That initial handshake
                    this time was clearly going to be important. Nixon left the plane, walked down
                    the steps, and went over and shook Zhou En-lai's hand. This was a famous
                    photograph. I have a copy in my house of just the hands shaking. This picture is
                    dedicated to the New China Hands. Then there was a restrained reception at the
                    airport, with the band playing, the national anthems, review of the honor guard,
                    and so on. There were not many people there. The reception was very cool. Then
                    there was the motorcade to Tiananmen Square and on to the guest house. There
                    were no crowds in the streets, except the usual ones. No one had been lined up
                    specially. Again, I was somewhat disappointed. The press noted that the
                    reception was rather restrained.</p>
                <p>Q: I think that this point came out in my interviews with others. John Holdridge,
                    for example, mentioned the coolness of the reception. Chas Freeman mentioned the
                    same thing. It was almost humdrum as far as they were concerned.</p>
                <p>LORD: It was, considering the buildup and the drama of the moment. It was sort of
                    anticlimactic. There was the inherent drama, but there wasn't the color and
                    excitement that one expected. I can't say that I was depressed by this, just
                    that we felt that there was not quite the elation we expected to feel at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>We got to the guesthouse. I think that Zhou En-lai briefly said goodbye to the
                    President to allow him to freshen up and relax. About one hour later Zhou En-lai
                    came back to the guesthouse and asked to see Kissinger. He said that Chairman
                    Mao wanted to see President Nixon right away. Before the trip we had never
                    pinned down when the President would see Mao Zedong. Obviously, we assumed that
                    he would, of course. This would be a meeting with the highest Chinese leader.
                    The Chinese indicated that Mao would meet with the President, but they never
                    said precisely when this would be. This was a typical example of the Chinese
                    style, where the Emperor used to keep visitors on edge, and the schedule was
                    never fixed until the last minute. This was true of other trips that we had.
                    This was partly intended to keep us off balance, and partly to make us feel
                    grateful when the actual meeting took place and that it did take place.</p>
                <p>The immediate reaction was, not being mad, that they just sort of said,”Come on
                    over and see the Emperor.” Obviously, there was instead excitement. Also, there
                    was an immediate recognition that, whatever the restraint of the initial
                    reception, the fact that Mao was going to see President Nixon within the first
                    couple of hours of his arrival was very significant. It was going to send a
                    clear signal to the world and to the Chinese people that Mao personally was
                    behind this visit and the historic importance of the event. So this was
                    obviously very good news, even if it was a somewhat unorthodox way to proceed
                    with the leader of the Free World.</p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>Nixon asked Kissinger to go with him. That was his intention, to have just the
                    two of them at the meeting. Nixon didn't want Secretary of State Rogers along.
                    We also thought that there might be more than one meeting with Mao, since this
                    was so early, and Rogers could go to a later meeting. Indeed at one point Zhou
                    had suggested that there might be two meetings with Mao. Kissinger, to my
                    everlasting gratitude, asked me to go as well to this historic meeting.
                    Basically, on the one hand, it was a reward for all of the hard work that I had
                    done, generally for Kissinger and specifically on the China initiative and that,
                    together with Holdridge, I had been in overall charge of the major preparations
                    for the Nixon visit and the drafting of the Shanghai Communique. However, it was
                    also in Kissinger's self interest to have a note taker there, so that Kissinger
                    could concentrate on the conversation.</p>
                <p>So I got to take notes at the Nixon meeting with Mao. Also, Kissinger knew that I
                    was one of the world's great note takers. I always got meetings down verbatim,
                    even the jibes. There was that element to it.</p>
                <p>And so, with great excitement, we went off to see Chairman Mao in the leaders'
                    compound. We walked past a hallway with a ping pong table and into Mao's modest
                    study, which was lined with books. Mao already was somewhat frail, physically,
                    but nowhere near as much as he was during later meetings he had with Kissinger
                    and with President Ford. I tied for first place among Americans with Kissinger
                    in meeting with Mao five times. That is, once with Nixon, once with Ford, and
                    three times with Kissinger alone.</p>
                <p>Mao had a couple of nurses around him and clearly needed some help. He was an old
                    man but not a dying man by any means. He was just somewhat frail, physically,
                    but not shockingly so. Indeed, he struck us with his presence. It is hard to
                    sort out how much you expect when you see a great man, given his reputation. I
                    say great, not in a positive sense but, in the sense of impact. Mao was
                    obviously a very bad man in most respects. As for the physical force of the man,
                    how much was I making this up and how much Mao really made this impression? Both
                    Kissinger and I felt that if we walked into a cocktail party and had no idea who
                    this guy Mao was, his very presence would still have had an impact on us.</p>
                <p>So it was Nixon, Kissinger, and myself on our side, and Mao, Zhou En-lai, Nancy
                    Tang as interpreter, Wang Hai-rung, and perhaps one or two others on the Chinese
                    side. I'd have to look at the picture to be sure.</p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>The meeting lasted for about an hour. I remember distinctly, coming out of the
                    meeting somewhat disappointed. I was impressed with the physical impact of Mao.
                    It was also clear that this man was tough, ruthless, and came from a peasant
                    background, in contrast to the elegant, Mandarin quality of Zhou En-lai.
                    However, I thought that the conversation was somewhat episodic and not very
                    full. Kissinger had sort of the same reaction as I did. Mao was speaking, as he
                    usually did, in brush strokes, whereas we were used to the elegant and somewhat
                    lengthy presentations of Zhou En-lai. Mao would just throw in a few sentences, a
                    few brush strokes. He went from topic to topic in rather a casual way.</p>
                <p>As we left, however, we were obviously happy. We had had this immediate, friendly
                    meeting with Mao. I can't remember which meeting discussed which topic. However,
                    I am sure that we both talked about the danger of the polar bear, the Soviet
                    Union. Mao certainly said, in one of these meetings, and I believe this was the
                    one, that we could wait to settle the Taiwan problem for 100 years. In one of
                    the meetings, and it may have been this one, when told that he had made a major
                    change in China, he said: “No, I've only changed a few things near Beijing.” So
                    we had these sometimes rather epigrammatic comments. It seemed at times that he
                    sometimes did not quite know what he was talking about. He was rather casual
                    about what we would be getting at, in what order, and what was his agenda. So
                    his comments seemed somewhat disjointed, not particularly elegant, and a little
                    disappointing.</p>
                <p>However, we changed our mind on Mao's deftness as we thought about it, and I
                    don't think that this is a rationalization, and as the trip went on we realized
                    just how important this meeting was. It was important because, immediately on
                    arrival, and for the reasons I mentioned, he had indicated to the world and to
                    his own public, his backing for this strategic move. It was also important
                    because Mao was setting out the main lines, however thinly and in brush strokes,
                    for Zhou En-lai to elaborate on in the coming days in the various conversations.
                    So maybe there were only two or three sentences on the polar bear, but there was
                    the whole line of anti hegemony and the fact that we had to get together against
                    the Soviets, not as allies, but as a matter of common concern. It was there,
                    authorized, and for Zhou En-lai to fill out. On Taiwan, as I said, Mao said that
                    China could wait. It was there in the communique, in which they could take a
                    tough position, but we could take our own position. We didn't have to resolve
                    this question now. We could move on and kick it down the road.</p>
                <p>I'm not saying that these remarks made everything easy. They just authorized the
                    lines of instruction which Mao was setting forth in a strategic way. He had
                    covered these two, key issues, Taiwan and Russia, and he raised some other
                    issues which I cannot now recall. The transcripts of all these meetings, most of
                    which I produced, are publicly available now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>LORD: I don't recall whether Mao mentioned Vietnam. The Vietnam issue probably
                    came up, but I just don't recall. We only spent an hour in this meeting, and
                    there were translations to be made, so there wasn't that much time available.
                    There was some personal banter and also the fact that both Nixon and Mao
                    recognized the other's vision and courage in taking this important step.</p>
                <p>However, as we thought about it, and certainly by the end of the trip, we
                    realized in fact that Mao had put in a very skillful performance. In his
                    understated and unorthodox way he had set forth the main lines of Chinese
                    policy, he had made clear the features that he considered very important, and
                    that other things could fall into place. Mao was self-deprecating, even though
                    he had a tremendous ego. He had some humor. He had gotten through his agenda
                    purposefully, even though it seemed casual and episodic. He had managed to cover
                    the main points. I still don't think that it was one of the great conversations
                    of all time. However, I think that Mao was much more purposeful and skillful
                    than we gave him credit for at first. We realized that within a few days.</p>
                <p>Q: I was just thinking about what you said about not having pinned down in
                    advance when President Nixon was going to see Mao. They could have put a really
                    unpleasant twist on it if Nixon had only been allowed to see Mao at the very end
                    of the trip.</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, it would have been much worse if we hadn't seen Mao aall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But if you had only seen him at the end of the trip, it
                        would havindicated that Mao was saying: “All right, I'll see Nixon,
                        but...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Not necessarily, and I'll tell you why. During most trips, and our
                    subsequent and more recent trips to China, usually we worked our way up the
                    scale. We started by seeing the Foreign Minister or even the Vice Foreign
                    Minister. Then we saw the Premier. And we ended up seeing the President or the
                    Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party. So it would have been somewhat natural,
                    to see Mao late; certainly the meeting would have to take place in Beijing.
                    However, on the last day in Beijing, we could have had a sort of climax meeting
                    with Chairman Mao, blessing what had happened. It would not have been a put
                    down. On balance, having the meeting right at the outset was the best outcome.
                    By putting the Chairman's immediate stamp of approval on the trip for the world
                    to see, as well as sketching the key Chinese position for Zhou to flesh out. But
                    having the meeting with Mao as a finale would have been fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: However, it was rather unorthodox and even more significant thave the
                    meeting with Chairman Mao first.</p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Did you really get on the plane at Andrews Air Force
                    Base, not knowing whether President Nixon would meet Chairman Mao?</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, we knew in our gut that Mao would meet Nixon. Conceivably, he could
                    do the unthinkable and not meet Nixon, but he didn't. However, when we left
                    Andrews Air Force Base, we did not have an agreed time for the meeting with Mao,
                    and they never explicitly promised a meeting. I don't remember what the Chinese
                    formulation was on this point. They certainly gave favorable indications but I
                    don't know whether they actually said: “We can give you 100 percent assurance
                    that President Nixon will see Mao.” I'll bet that they didn't. I know that we
                    made unilateral statements that Nixon would, of course, be seeing Mao. We said
                    that we would like to know when this would be, but we knew that this was going
                    to happen. It would have been unthinkable if it didn't.</p>
                <p>So we were sure that Nixon would see Chairman Mao. There was just that one
                    percent uncertainty, perhaps to keep us off balance, in not confirming the
                    schedule for the President, which was mildly annoying. However, it was typical
                    of the Chinese Emperor indicating that he was the head of the Middle Kingdom and
                    that we were showing obeisance. So we honestly did not know the timing of the
                    meeting with Mao and were surprised that it took place that quickly. We expected
                    the more traditional meetings with Zhou En-lai and then a meeting with Chairman
                    Mao toward the end of the visit.</p>
                <p>Q: On several occasions you made reference to the practices of the Chinese
                    Emperors. I've heard this kind of comment from other China experts or people who
                    have dealt with China. You mentioned that China regards itself as the Middle
                    Kingdom. Was it very much in everybody's mind that the People's Republic of
                    China may be a communist regime, but we're still dealing with something like a
                    Chinese court?</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, hopefully not in a subservient or obsequious way, but out of respect,
                    yes. We were dealing with tough, ruthless, Communist Chinese leaders. However,
                    we were also dealing with people who were heading the world's most populous
                    nation which, we were sure, even then, would be a major world power in the next
                    century. And a nation which had the world's richest civilization and culture.
                    And a nation which had been Number One more than any other country in
                    history.</p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>One of the complications in dealing with China is that the Chinese have had so
                    little experience dealing with the outside world as equals. For 4000 to 5000
                    years they were Number One in the world, at least in their view. Everyone else
                    was either invisible, irrelevant, distant barbarians, or tributaries. Then China
                    had a bad century or two. They were dominated by outside powers from roughly the
                    mid 1800s on. They probably began to lose their technological dominance to the
                    West and Europe by the 1600s or 1700s. Then China was actually humiliated by the
                    British and other Europeans, the Japanese invasion [1937-1945], fighting against
                    us in Korea [1950-1953], and other experiences in the 19th and 20th centuries.
                    So after 4000 to 5000 years as Number One and 100-150 years of being humiliated,
                    this is where we found them when we went there. We are still dealing with the
                    consequences of that, although for the last 15 or 20 years, since the reforms
                    started, the Chinese have sort of stood up as equals. They are getting used to
                    dealing with other countries as equals. This combination of arrogance or
                    self-confidence, derived from being the Middle Kingdom and Number One for so
                    long, plus the more recent humiliations and slights by foreigners and
                    xenophobia, and very little experience in dealing with other countries as equals
                    has made it particularly complicated to deal with China.</p>
                <p>So, when we went to China, Nixon and Kissinger in their toasts and their
                    statements were careful to say, and with genuine sincerity, that China was a
                    great civilization and a great country. They said that as China had been in
                    business for 5,000 years, we've only been in business for 200 years. We paid
                    careful attention to Chinese face and were polite. Also, we believe that this is
                    true. Frankly, as a world superpower, much stronger than China, we can afford to
                    be magnanimous. We could be generous and sincere, as I said, because militarily,
                    economically, and in every other way we were totally dominant of China. So for
                    all of these reasons we were aware of this historical, cultural background and
                    we paid due deference to it.</p>
                <p>The Chinese are also geniuses at protocol, in making you feel at home, and are
                    very careful with you. Their whole idea is to inculcate in outsiders coming to
                    the Middle Kingdom a sense of obligation for their hospitality and friendship.
                    In effect, they seek to create ties of alleged friendship. They want us to feel
                    that friends do favors for other friends. For example, if the Chinese were
                    taking Nixon or Kissinger to the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, the Temple of
                    Heaven, or the Summer Palace, and they have two hours to cover the Summer
                    Palace, what they would do is to break up two hours in their planning into
                    20-minute segments. They never want to give a visitor the feeling that he or she
                    is rushed. In going to the Summer Palace, to take that example, if you stop for
                    longer than they expected to look at the Empress's Jade Boat, or something like
                    that, instead of pushing you and saying that we're not going to get through
                    everything, they just agree among themselves, without telling the guests, “All
                    right, we'll cut out the next 20 minute segment and go to the next one.” So you
                    end up getting through on time in terms of what the schedule says but you never
                    feel rushed.</p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>The Chinese food was terrific, at least in the early visits. However, it got
                    worse as we visited China in subsequent years. The food during the Nixon visit,
                    particularly the banquet in Hangzhou, was very good, indeed. So the Chinese have
                    tried to create this sense of subtle superiority, Middle Kingdom great host
                    protocol, and so on. All of this is designed to make you somewhat more amenable
                    on substantive matters and deferential in spirit.</p>
                <p>Q: I must say that the one scene that sticks in my mind is oNixon making a toast.
                    And the band played “America the Beautiful.” I never heard this song played so
                    much, which I have always thought should be our national anthem, anyway. It was
                    magnificently done.</p>
                <p>LORD: Before getting into the substance, I would like to mention some of the
                    public events. I don't have these in order, but among the things Nixon did was
                    to attend these banquets, where the Chinese PLA [People's Liberation Army] band
                    played “America the Beautiful,” “Turkey in the Straw,” and other melodies, all
                    of this on television. I can still recall the vision of the two leaders toasting
                    each other in a huge dining room in the Great Hall of the People. There were
                    about 10,000 at this banquet, or something along those lines. That was one
                    public event. Another event involved going to a dreadful, Cultural Revolution
                    type ballet with Madame Mao. Another one that we went to was a major, gymnastics
                    exhibition in a gymnasium. Nixon also went to see the Great Wall and the
                    Forbidden City. Kissinger and I were busy working on the communique at that
                    point, so we missed that. Of course, we had already been there. That was the
                    point where poor Nixon went to the Great Wall and said: “It surely is a Great
                    Wall.” Those were the major, public appearances during the Nixon visit to
                    Beijing. He went on the lake in Hangzhou, and, I believe, visited an industrial
                    exhibition in Shanghai.</p>
                <p>To get back to the Nixon meeting with Mao, if I can. One amusing, personal
                    highlight, which you've probably heard, was that, as we concluded the meeting,
                    the Chinese came in with the communique announcing the meeting and photographs
                    of it. The photographs had all of us in them. The communique said that Mr.
                    Nixon, Mr. Kissinger, and Mr. Lord were present. Nixon and Kissinger looked at
                    each other and said to the Chinese: “Please cut out Mr. Lord from all of the
                    photographs and out of the communique and keep secret that he was at this
                    meeting.”</p>
                <p>The reason that they did this is that even they were embarrassed that Secretary
                    of State Rogers had not been at the meeting. They figured that it was
                    humiliating enough that the National Security Adviser was with the President at
                    this historic meeting, but the Secretary of State was not. To add on top of that
                    the fact that the Special Assistant to the National Security Adviser was there
                    as a third person but the Secretary of State was not was too much, even for
                    them. The Chinese clearly must have been puzzled by this, but they readily went
                    along with this request.</p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>So the official communique just said that Nixon and Kissinger were present on our
                    side. The pictures cropped me out of it. I was on the right side of the picture
                    as you looked at it. I, of course, was disappointed, because I wanted worldwide
                    fame, but I was sworn to secrecy. Very few people knew about this. I don't even
                    believe, in fact I'm quite sure, that the State Department didn't know that I
                    had been present at the meeting, either. I just can't remember now that anybody
                    knew.</p>
                <p>I will now confess that when I got back to Washington, I told my wife. I wasn't
                    about to keep this secret from her. However, for a couple of years this secret
                    was kept from the entire world. Then, just to show you the Chinese style, when I
                    went back to Beijing with Kissinger when he visited on his own, in 1973, when he
                    met Mao on his own, we were sitting with Zhou En-lai. Wang Hai Rung, the same
                    grandniece of Mao's, who was close to Mao but also sat in on our meetings, as
                    part of Zhou En-lai's staff, came in with a piece of paper for Zhou En-lai. Zhou
                    En-lai read it out and then said to Kissinger: “Chairman Mao wants to see Dr.
                    Kissinger and Winston Lord.” Now, Chairman Mao wouldn't have known me from Mel
                    Gibson or Woody Allen. I was sitting there with several other US officials, all
                    higher ranking. In protocol terms I would have been the last person going with
                    Kissinger to see Mao, because you can only take one person. The Chinese knew,
                    first, that I was the closest person to Kissinger and, perhaps, the most
                    important in terms of the China initiative. Secondly, I had attended a Kissinger
                    meeting with Mao, but this occasion was secret, and nobody knew about it.
                    Thirdly, the Chinese knew that Kissinger would want to take me for general
                    reasons and because of my note taking and advice. So they thought up the gimmick
                    of Mao wanting me to be there, along with Kissinger. This gave Kissinger the
                    pretext, despite protocol, of taking me with him. I went to this meeting. It was
                    a very nice gesture on their part. On a subsequent trip they gave me a picture
                    of the Nixon meeting with Mao, with me in it, to prove that I had been there.
                    Since then, of course, it has been well publicized, but that was an interesting
                    sidelight.</p>
                <p>Now we ought to get to the substance of the trip. We had a series of meetings
                    with Zhou En-lai and also some meetings, particularly to negotiate the language
                    of the communique and other, loose ends, with the Vice Minister of Foreign
                    Affairs, whose name was Chao Kuan-hua. He was a very able vice minister. He
                    subsequently got into trouble because he bet on the Gang of Four against Deng
                    Xiaoping. He made the wrong bet. His wife, who was a translator, was close to
                    Madame Mao.</p>
                <p>So we had two kinds of discussions. There were meetings between President Nixon
                    and Zhou En-lai on substantive issues. On our side were Nixon, Kissinger,
                    Holdridge, and myself. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Rogers, Assistant Secretary
                    of State Marshall Green, and other State Department people were meeting with the
                    Chinese Foreign Minister, Ji Peng-fei. They were dealing with bilateral issues
                    only, such as economic and cultural exchanges, and so forth. They may have
                    touched on some international issues, but their discussion of them would have
                    been superficial. In any case the Chinese Foreign Minister, Ji, was less
                    important than their Vice Foreign Minister, Chao. Of course, Nixon was relying
                    on Kissinger as his adviser.</p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>So the real discussions were between Nixon and Zhou En-lai, and they ranged over
                    all of the issues that one would expect, whether it was on the general, historic
                    nature of the opening to China or Russia, South Asia, the Middle East, Vietnam,
                    Korea, Taiwan, and bilateral relations. There was discussion with Zhou En-lai of
                    general principles and major issues and particularly Taiwan. The specific
                    negotiating session on the language of the communique took place with Vice
                    Foreign Minister Chao, with great assistance from Assistant Minister Zhang
                    Wen-chin. There were some loose ends unresolved on the communique generally,
                    apart from Taiwan, but mostly this was directed at trying to beef up the
                    positive sections toward the end. These sections weren't particularly
                    contentious.</p>
                <p>We had really tough negotiations on Taiwan, day after day, right down to the
                    wire. They finally ended up on our last night in Beijing, when we were to take
                    off the next day for Hangzhou. We reached agreement. I still remember this. I
                    don't think that I went with Kissinger to tell Nixon, late at night, that we had
                    reached final agreement on the communique. Of course, you know the formulations
                    agreed on, and I won't go through all of that. Basically, it was a rather
                    historic formulation which has held up to this day. The Politburo of the Chinese
                    Communist Party approved the communique that evening. Of course, we had approved
                    it.</p>
                <p>We took off for Hangzhou on the following morning. When we got there, Secretary
                    of State Rogers and Marshall Green saw the communique for the first time. That
                    is no way to do business. Either on the plane to Hangzhou or in Hangzhou, they
                    said basically that this communique was a disaster. They probably did not use
                    that phrasing, but they were disturbed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they say something close to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: They were very critical, particularly on Taiwan. They said that President
                    Nixon was going to get killed at home and around the world and that we had given
                    in too much to the Chinese. We thought that this view was nonsense, in
                    substantive terms. Each side had declared its positions. In fact, we had
                    negotiated the communique pretty skillfully and we thought that most of their
                    comments on the communique were - frankly understandably - piqued at having been
                    left out of the negotiations. The process was lousy and State should have been
                    included. But the communique turned out to be excellent.</p>
                <p>So Nixon had a terrible decision. On the one hand, the Politburo of the Chinese
                    Communist Party had already approved the communique. On the other hand, he
                    risked having Secretary of State Rogers and Marshall Green, if not on the
                    record, then leaking out on background that they had not only been excluded from
                    the negotiations but that we had also sold out on Taiwan. So Nixon had the
                    humiliating experience of sending Kissinger back to Hangzhou to reopen the
                    negotiations on the communique.</p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>I still remember an amusing sidelight on this. I happened to be in my underwear
                    when Kissinger somehow came into my room to ask me about something. Just after
                    that President Nixon came into my room and made some stupid joke because he saw
                    Kissinger with me in my underwear. That isn't the point. This was a poor attempt
                    at humor. Then Nixon asked seriously what we were going to do about the views of
                    Secretary of State Rogers on the communique. He said: “I can't afford to have
                    the State Department undercutting what we've accomplished.” So he then said:
                    “Henry, you've got to go back to the Chinese and get some of these concessions
                    which Rogers and Green have given us on specific language.” Some of these were
                    impossible to get. Obviously, State never could have gotten them either, but you
                    can't blame the State Department for being irate. So clearly they were going to
                    ask for many changes, both because they'd like to get them, but also because
                    they figured that it would be more embarrassing to Kissinger if we didn't get
                    them. Some of their suggestions, however, were minor nuances, or nitpicks.</p>
                <p>Kissinger, of course, was very resistant to this. I don't remember exactly what
                    the conversation was. But he dreaded going back to Zhou En-lai and saying in
                    effect: “I've got a small detail here. We know that your Politburo has approved
                    this, as well as Chairman Mao. Here we are in Hangzhou, and the Politburo isn't
                    even around, and Chairman Mao is back there in Beijing. However, by the way,
                    we'd like to reopen some of the sensitive issues on Taiwan that we've both
                    agreed on after months of negotiations.” This was going to be embarrassing, to
                    say the least. It was our own fault for having cut out the State Department in
                    the negotiations on the communique.So we reopened the negotiations on the
                    communique that night. It was very humiliating. Kissinger explained our
                    bureaucratic and public relations situation. We suggested some changes but
                    didn't try out all of the changes that the State Department wanted, particularly
                    the ones that were really dramatic in their import. Zhou En-lai handled the
                    matter very skillfully. He tried to avoid making this situation any more awkward
                    and embarrassing than it really was.</p>
                <p>There was one key point, I believe, that Green made and was adjusted. We had
                    language htat reaffirmed all our alliances except Taiwan. It was meant to
                    reassure allies, but the omission of Taiwan would have been glaring. Thus State
                    suggested and we got Chinese approval not to mention the alliances. And
                    Kissinger in his press conference on Chinese soil verbally reaffirmed our
                    commitment to Taiwan. That change was important.</p>
                <p>Zhou also gave in on a few secondary points. I don't remember the details, which
                    improved the draft in a couple of places but didn't touch anything fundamental,
                    nor could they, since the Politburo and Chairman Mao had already approved it,
                    and Zhou En-lai was operating on his own. He threw a few crumbs to us, which we
                    then included in the communique.</p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>We went on to Shanghai the next day, and Kissinger presented a press briefing on
                    the communique, including reasserting on Chinese soil that we would continue to
                    have our defense relationship with Taiwan. This was a very sensitive point. It
                    is one thing to say this in the United States, but to say it in Shanghai was
                    quite extraordinary. Kissinger, as it were, was doing a high wire act, and he
                    wanted to protect the President's domestic flank and his international
                    reputation, as well as fears on Taiwan, without overly alienating the Chinese.
                    This was a very skillful performance.</p>
                <p>We were not 100 percent sure, particularly after the State Department had spooked
                    us a little bit, what kind of reception the trip and the Shanghai Communique
                    would get, both immediately and when we returned to Washington. Even as we flew
                    back to Washington, with the euphoria of the trip, we were still a little bit
                    concerned about what the reaction would be. Well, once again we underestimated
                    the popular dimension of this initiative. There may have been some carping at
                    the time, but, on the whole, everyone not only welcomed the trip as a tremendous
                    success, with this romance and euphoria. They also said that the Shanghai
                    Communique was very well done.</p>
                <p>Q: As I recall it, and, Nancy, you might remember, Marshall Green's main point,
                    in the Oral History interview I did with him, was that there was some sort of
                    reference or drawing a parallel to Secretary of State Dean Acheson's leaving
                    South Korea out of the U.S. defense perimeter in the Pacific, when he made a
                    speech to the National Press Club in January, 1950, not long before North Korea
                    invaded South Korea in June, 1950. He had outlined U.S. interests in the Far
                    East but didn't include Taiwan as one of them. Does that ring a bell with
                    you?</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, in the first place I want to make clear on the record how much
                    respect I have for Marshall Green. He handled himself, as did Secretary of State
                    Rogers, with tremendous dignity when they were really cut out of things that
                    they really should not have been cut out of. I'm sure that whatever concerns
                    Marshall Green had were genuine, though he felt understandable annoyance at the
                    process. I don't recall that particular comment by Marshall Green, if that's
                    what it is. But his concerns were almost entirely focused on the Taiwan portion
                    of the communique. As I said I believe there was a reference to various allies
                    which suggested an omission of Taiwan and therefore all references were taken
                    out, so that is probably what Green was referring to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His comments were on Taiwan...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>LORD: But we couldn't have possibly stated in the Shanghai Communique that we
                    were going to defend Taiwan. We certainly had the expectation of a peaceful
                    resolution of this matter. Regarding the arms sales question we talked about
                    continuing them, which was dicey. We didn't break our defense treaty with Taiwan
                    at that point. At some point in the communique we used the formulation to the
                    effect that we were willing to reduce our forces on Taiwan as tensions in the
                    area subsided. This was really a reference to Vietnam. We said, in effect, that
                    if the Chinese helped us to end the Vietnam War, they would see us reducing our
                    forces in Taiwan. Since a part of the rationale for our forces in Taiwan was
                    regional stability, including Vietnam, we could justify it on those grounds
                    because it was a subtle way of meeting their concerns on that point. It also
                    could suggest that a peaceful approach by China in the area, and to the Taiwan
                    question, could also help the withdrawal process</p>
                <p>Marshall Green may well have made a comment of this kind, but I just don't recall
                    the details of what his concern was. I'm sure that it referred to Taiwan.</p>
                <p>Q: During all of this what was the impression of Nixon, Kissinger, and yourself
                    of Madame Mao? Where did you feel that she stood in the Chinese structure at
                    that time?</p>
                <p>LORD: We didn't see much of her. I think that she was probably at one of the
                    banquets. She was the escort to the President and Mrs. Nixon at the ballet. That
                    was the only exposure that we had to her. I never talked to her in any way. I
                    was standing around when she made some small talk with President Nixon. It was
                    my impression at the time that she didn't seem particularly friendly. I think
                    that, even then, we suspected that she was less enthusiastic about this opening
                    than Chairman Mao. We weren't aware as yet, that I can recall, of the Gang of
                    Four mentality and where she stood on this spectrum. However, either at the time
                    or since then we thought that she was less enthusiastic about this opening.
                    Maybe not resistant, but certainly less enthusiastic.</p>
                <p>I should have mentioned the Lin Biao incident during the trip to Beijing in
                    October, 1971. There was tightened security for reasons that we didn't know
                    about at the time. It turned out that two weeks earlier, in September, 1971, Lin
                    Biao, partly, we believe, revolting against the opening to the United States,
                    made a grab for power. He became involved in a struggle with Chairman Mao, tried
                    to escape China in an airplane, and crashed in Mongolia. The world knew nothing
                    of this at that point. This incident was covered up for some time. However, this
                    resulted in a rather tense security situation, and we saw a lot of security
                    precautions in Beijing.</p>
                <p>I'm not saying that Madame Mao was linked up with Lin Biao, but she was probably
                    in the more skeptical part of the spectrum with him on the American connection.
                    I can't remember how much we knew of this at the time, but she did strike us as
                    less friendly in the brief encounters we had with her.VIII. NSC - CHINA. ISSUES,
                    TRIPS (1971-1973)</p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>Q: During these discussions in China, what was the view of the Chinese of the
                    Soviets at that time? Were they trying to get any information from us or were
                    they saying that we both know that the Soviets are bad people?</p>
                <p>LORD: Let's get into some of these other issues. Regarding the Soviets, that
                    clearly was a major theme throughout the Nixon visit to China. Kissinger and
                    Nixon would play on this threat to China and us. They were always a little
                    careful so that, if these remarks were transmitted to Brezhnev, they wouldn't be
                    too embarrassed. They were fairly heavy on the dimensions of the Soviet threat.
                    When we would talk to the Soviets, we would never say negative things about
                    China, but we also would try to improve relations with Russia.</p>
                <p>The Chinese were the same way on the Soviets. Certainly, Mao was the bluntest
                    about Russia. The higher up you went in the Chinese hierarchy, the blunter they
                    were about Russia. This was true of Deng Xiaoping later, with the talk about the
                    polar bear and the threat. This attitude held true for 20 years. Even during my
                    last meeting with Deng Xiaoping in 1988, or whenever it was, he was talking
                    about the Russian as well as the Japanese threat to China. So that theme was
                    there a lot.</p>
                <p>Early on we began briefing the Chinese on our relations with the Soviets. We
                    worked on improving relations with the Russians, but we were also using the
                    Chinese to induce the Russians to improve relations with us. With the Chinese,
                    on the one hand we wanted to reassure them that we weren't being feckless and
                    naive in seeking detente with the Russians. However, on the other hand, we had
                    to spend a certain amount of time letting the Chinese know that we were moving
                    somewhere with the Russians, too, to get them a little excited. So it was a
                    carefully nuanced game here.</p>
                <p>Kissinger was always meticulous, and Nixon was on his trip, to brief the Chinese
                    about what our strategy was toward the Soviet Union. Basically, we would say:
                    “Look, we want to improve our relations with Moscow. We don't deny that. They
                    have nuclear weapons, and we don't want to get into a war with them. However, we
                    have no illusions. The Soviets are tough and expansionist. And by the way, they
                    are more of a threat to you than to us, given their geography, history, and
                    capabilities. We don't really trust the Russians, but it's in our national
                    interest to try to improve our relationship with them on a hard-headed,
                    pragmatic basis. We'll use pressures, but we'll also use some incentives. We
                    know what we're doing.” The sub-text to this was: “We are making some progress
                    with the Soviets, and you Chinese should be sure that you keep up with us and
                    improve relations with us, so that we don't get ahead of you in relations with
                    the Russians.” Indeed, we had a much more concrete agenda with Moscow than we
                    did with China, where we were just launching a relationship. With Russia we had
                    topics like arms control, Berlin, trade, exchanges, etc. With China it was
                    essentially geopolitical dialogue in the early years.</p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>The Chinese would be flat out in talking about Soviet pressures and threats. I
                    don't know that they even went through the motions of saying that they wanted
                    better relations with the Soviets. They might have, but they would talk about
                    past Soviet perfidy and future concerns. I don't know that they complained that
                    the Soviets did not help them with nuclear weapons, but they certainly referred
                    to the border clashes and continuing Soviet pressures on China. At times, and
                    this was truer in subsequent years, particularly in the mid 1970s, the Chinese
                    would say: “You Americans are getting a little na�ve with the Soviets. Det�nte
                    is really an illusion. You're getting too soft and you're trying to stand on our
                    shoulders to reach the Soviets. You're trying to use us and you're being naive
                    with the Russians.” We got some of that flavor, particularly from Deng Xiaoping
                    later on, but not so much from Mao and Zhou En-lai earlier on, as I recall.</p>
                <p>So this was a heavy theme in our talks with China. Then there was the
                    anti-hegemony reference in the Shanghai Communique. We were careful to brief the
                    Chinese on what we were doing with Moscow. For example, after President Nixon's
                    trip to China in February, 1972, we went to Moscow in May, 1972. Then, in June,
                    1972, Kissinger, myself, Holdridge, and so on went back to China for two main
                    reasons. One was to debrief the Chinese on the Moscow Summit Meeting and fill
                    them in, which we continually did. Secondly, we tried to get them to help more
                    on Vietnam. Those were the two main reasons. So that was an example.</p>
                <p>Through these trips, and more and more as we went along, we briefed the Chinese
                    generally on policy and the status of negotiations with the Russians, always
                    giving them a hard edge twist that we were not na�ve and that we would make sure
                    that the Russians did not take advantage of us. We began to share intelligence
                    reports with the Chinese. Often Jon Howe, who was a military aide on the NSC
                    staff, and I would go off and brief the Chinese on Russian troop deployments. We
                    would also give them information on Soviet capabilities, both to show that we
                    were friendly and that we were trying to share information that might be useful
                    to them. And also, frankly, to make the Chinese a little nervous about Soviet
                    intentions.</p>
                <p>So the Russian dimension was very important. It was not the only reason that we
                    opened up with China. That's been proven since the end of the Soviet threat to
                    the US in 1989-90. Over a 20, 30, or 40 year period we will have a large agenda
                    with China, which is going to be a major power. Certainly, our joint concern
                    about the Soviet threat was the glue in the early going, but we've shown, and we
                    will show that we have other reasons for dealing with China, even without the
                    Russian threat. That was the primary reason then, but there are all the other
                    factors which I have mentioned, including the Vietnam issue, the attempt to try
                    to stabilize regional stability in Asia, North Korea, and the Taiwan Straits, to
                    a certain extent. If the Chinese have good relations with us, they'll have less
                    incentive to attack Taiwan and wreck their relations with us.</p>
                <p>Eventually trade and cultural exchange and other exchanges have become our other
                    reasons for good relations with China. However, the Soviet theme was the
                    dominant theme in the early 70s and 80s.</p>

                        approachindistaste among the Chinese for the Kim Il Sung regime in North
                        Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No, not at that time. This aspect has become clearer in the last few years
                    and as we speak, here in 1998. However, the Chinese didn't show much daylight on
                    North Korea, and I'll get back to some of the other issues. On North Korea I
                    didn't detect any opening. They had no interest in South Korea at that point.
                    Even then, however, they probably made it clear to us, and in fact, I know that
                    they did, that they had no interest in seeing the North Koreans attacking the
                    South Koreans and perhaps dragging them into another war against us. I'm sure
                    that the Chinese said that they hoped there would be stability on the Korean
                    peninsula. However, they showed no daylight between them and North Korea.
                    Certainly, their references in the Shanghai Communique and other talking points
                    would be pretty solid in their connection with North Korea.</p>
                <p>I would like to make clear that Zhou En-lai was so sophisticated that he wouldn't
                    use terms like lips and teeth and the usual garbage which you get out of the
                    Chinese. It would be much more elegant than that, but substantively he would
                    still be very solid with the North Koreans, I am quite sure. I should say that
                    the conversations between Zhou En-lai, on the one hand, and Kissinger and Nixon,
                    on the other hand, were the most interesting and impressive, diplomatic
                    conversations that I have ever witnessed.</p>
                <p>On Vietnam, which is an important subject, we didn't fully realize then how much
                    the Chinese disliked the Vietnamese, and vice versa. In fact, the Chinese
                    invaded Vietnam a few years later (in 1979). We still saw the Chinese
                    essentially as a patron of Hanoi, along with Moscow, somewhat competing with
                    Moscow and somewhat constrained in terms of the degree to which they could help
                    us. This was because they might lose influence in Hanoi to Moscow if they were
                    more forthcoming with us than Moscow was.</p>
                <p>The same consideration applied to North Korea. Chinese concern about Russia
                    reflected not only the bilateral pressures between the two countries but their
                    impact around the world in places like North Korea and Vietnam where China was
                    in competition with Russia for influence. So this infused all of their views.
                    Some of this is retrospective and some of this we saw at the time. The Chinese
                    recognized that the Vietnamese could be pretty stubborn. They basically wanted
                    to get on with their relationship with us, and the Vietnam War was a real
                    annoyance, as I said earlier. The Chinese felt that it was a distraction to have
                    fighting going on near their border. The Chinese did have some support troops in
                    Laos, I believe. They never went in force into Vietnam, which adjoined their
                    border, and they still had their ideology and history to deal with. They had to
                    look as if they were close with Vietnam and they did want to compete with the
                    Soviets. So they had all of that working.</p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>However, they clearly wanted to get the Vietnam War settled. They would appeal to
                    us in these conversations and would say: “Look, you're bogged down in Vietnam.
                    Your domestic situation is terrible and there is a lot of uproar. More
                    importantly, you're getting distracted from your other, geopolitical
                    responsibilities. You can't face the polar bear around the world effectively,
                    and even your position in NATO is hurt because you're so preoccupied with
                    Vietnam and you're alienating a lot of countries.”</p>
                <p>They would use their ideology in this context. Again, Zhou En-lai would be
                    somewhat elegant in referring to a civil war in Vietnam and say that the
                    Vietnamese people demand justice, and all of that stuff. Basically, whatever
                    they put in public communiques, in our private talks they would appeal to our
                    national self-interest, more than ideology and references to lips and teeth. It
                    would be more like: “You guys are bogged down. It's in your interest to get this
                    war in Vietnam over with.” Of course it was in Beijing's interest too to end the
                    fighting near its border and also end the irritant in our bilateral relations,
                    which were more important to the Chinese than their ties to Vietnam.</p>
                <p>I don't think that the Chinese ever heavily pressured Hanoi. I think that they
                    were helpful to us in their own self interest. We think that their attitude was:
                    “There should be a military settlement. Hanoi shouldn't be requiring America to
                    humiliate itself by also deciding the political future of Vietnam.” We'll get
                    into Vietnam later, but basically the North Vietnamese position for years was
                    that the U.S. not only had to withdraw unilaterally but, as we left, we had to
                    overthrow the government of Nguyen van Thieu and replace it with a coalition
                    government. We made our position clear as early as the fall of 1969, when we
                    suggested a cease-fire in place. And we followed this up concretely in May,
                    1971, with a specific, seven-point proposal in the secret talks. I'll go into
                    this in greater detail when we talk about Vietnam. We made clear that we could
                    live with a unilateral withdrawal as well as a cease-fire, a return of POWs
                    [Prisoners of War], and international supervision, as long as the political
                    settlement was left for the Vietnamese people to decide.</p>
                <p>We made clear to the Chinese that it is one thing to have a military settlement
                    along those lines, but it's another thing to ask us to overthrow an ally and to
                    decide for the Vietnamese people themselves their political future. We said that
                    we're not going to do that. We kept stressing to the Chinese and asked them to
                    relay to Hanoi that we were prepared to reach a reasonable settlement but that
                    the military and political issues should be separated and that Hanoi couldn't
                    ask us to overthrow an ally. We also appealed to the Chinese. We said that if
                    you want us as a balancing force in Asia, the world, and particularly against
                    the Soviet Union, as well as a restraint on Japan, you should support us. If the
                    Japanese felt insecure, they might feel a need to remilitarize and develop
                    nuclear weapons. We said that if the Chinese want us to play this geopolitical
                    role, which was in their interest, they can't have us humiliated in Vietnam,
                    making all of our allies and friends around the world think that we are totally
                    untrustworthy. It is one thing to withdraw. It's another thing actually to
                    overthrow the Thieu Government and put in a coalition government.</p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>We kept pounding that theme with the Chinese, hoping that they would reinforce it
                    with Hanoi. We hoped that we could get a military settlement only, which was
                    what our objective was. We believe that the Chinese, probably somewhat
                    carefully, because of the Russian factor, conveyed this view to Hanoi, although
                    I can't prove it. I think that Zhou En-lai actually went to Vietnam after one of
                    our trips to China. I'm quite sure that he did. There were high level Chinese
                    emissaries who went to Hanoi. We can't prove what they said - I don't think that
                    we had any documentary evidence through intelligence channels. However, we are
                    quite sure basically about what Zhou En-lai said carefully in our discussions
                    and superficially from his trips and so on. There were some signs of Hanoi's
                    annoyance with its Russian and Chinese patrons. The Chinese, in their own self
                    interest, kept this issue out of the way between us. However, we believe that
                    they were leaning on Hanoi and probably saying something like: “Get the U.S. out
                    of South Vietnam and settle for the military side only. You can't expect the
                    Americans to overthrow the South Vietnamese Government. Time is on your side.
                    Once the U.S. gets out of South Vietnam, the country will fall into your lap
                    within a few years. You can afford to wait. In the meantime, get rid of the
                    American presence and let the chips fall where they may in your favor in the
                    coming years.”</p>
                <p>We think that the Chinese were talking to the North Vietnamese along these lines.
                    In any event, in their conversations with us, the Chinese never pressed us to
                    accept the North Vietnamese political proposals. They put the stress on
                    America's getting out of South Vietnam and getting the war behind us. So by
                    avoiding getting behind the overall North Vietnamese seven-point or nine-point
                    plan or whatever it was, over the course of the years, it was clear to us that
                    the Chinese were probably sympathetic to a military solution only.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Can I ask you, in connection with North Vietnam, but
                    going back a little bit further back in time, in terms of the Chinese-Vietnamese
                    relationship, how much did you think about it as a limiting factor in pursuing
                    our policies in Vietnam? For example, in a conversation with Allen Whiting which
                    Stu Kennedy had Whiting warned about a possible Chinese intervention in Vietnam.
                    John Holdridge rejected that possibility as being distracting and silly and that
                    the Chinese would never have intervened. Do you have a sense of how seriously
                    that was taken?</p>
                <p>LORD: I would like to make clear also that, as we talk about these issues now,
                    we're not just talking about the Nixon Summit Meeting in China but the tenor of
                    the conversations with the Chinese over a two or three-year period. This is the
                    only way to handle it. I can't be precise.</p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>I think, and this was more relevant during the Johnson Administration, although
                    it may also have been relevant to Nixon, that we had to keep in mind the
                    possibility of Chinese intervention. Short of that, there was also the danger of
                    making it really awkward for the Chinese by escalating near the Chinese border,
                    even if they didn't intervene and therefore affecting our bilateral
                    relationship. In my opinion, the possibility of Chinese intervention in the
                    Vietnam War was not a major factor. Certainly, by the time we got through the
                    early 1970s and the opening to China, I don't believe that we were really
                    concerned about the Chinese directly intervening in the war. There was nothing
                    in our conversations with the Chinese which ever threatened that. The Chinese
                    would often say that hostilities in Vietnam were awkward near their border. They
                    never threatened that they were going to intervene. Again, we'd have to look at
                    the history books. I think that there's some evidence that the Chinese had some
                    forces in Laos and Vietnam in a supporting role, e.g. anti-aircraft or
                    construction.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: There were actually Chinese troops in North Vietnam in
                    the mid-1960s, in a supporting role. I was thinking more in those terms as to
                    what degree, in that earlier period, was this something that all of you had in
                    mind?</p>
                <p>LORD: In terms of Vietnam policy I think that there was some concern but that it
                    was more relevant to the Johnson administration in the 1960s, than it was when
                    we got to China in the 1970s. One of the arguments against going into North
                    Vietnam on the ground, as well as even escalation like heavybombing, was the
                    Chinese reaction. That clearly was a factor. Reasonable people can disagree on
                    how important it was. Maybe it was fairly important in the 1960s, when I was
                    less directly involved in Vietnam policy. In the early 1970s I never recalled,
                    in dealing with the Vietnamese or the Chinese, that this was a major factor
                    then. I think that the significant considerations were domestic public opinion
                    and the cost-benefit ratio of military pressures. However, others may disagree,
                    and maybe correctly, that this was more of a constraint than I recall it as
                    having been. I think that it was more of a constraint in the 1960s, particularly
                    with respect to sending American troops into North Vietnam and getting closer to
                    the Chinese border.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: Exactly right. I almost mentioned that the feeling was: “Well, if we go too
                    far in Vietnam, we may make the mistake we made in Korea.” I'm sure that that
                    was a factor. People can disagree on the relative weight to attach to it. It was
                    probably significant in the 1960s, but my recollection is that it was not
                    significant in the early 1970s.</p>

                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>LORD: Let me raise one other issue. I can't give you a lot of detail on it, but
                    this was the India-Pakistan issue. The Russians were essentially lined up with
                    India during the Cold War, and the Chinese were lined up with Pakistan. On top
                    of that, Pakistan had done a favor to China and the United States by serving as
                    an intermediary and as a launching pad for our opening to China. So when the
                    crisis in Bangladesh broke out, and so on, I recall that this was regarded as a
                    significant issue for some time, although my memory is very bad on this. This
                    included talking to Huang Hua, the Chinese Ambassador to the UN in New York, and
                    coordinating our moves to warn India about not attacking Pakistan. I think that
                    we may have had some U.S. Navy ship movements in this connection.</p>
                <p>Q: USS ENTERPRISE, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, was sent into the Bay of
                    Bengal, I think it was, at that time. This was regarded as a tilt toward
                    Pakistan. The Indians still remember this.</p>
                <p>LORD: Of course they do. Kissinger finally went to India a few years later (about
                    1975) and tried to restore our relations with India, to a certain extent. There
                    is no question that, for a variety of reasons, Kissinger and Nixon wanted to
                    tilt toward Pakistan. It's a huge exaggeration to say that we did this solely as
                    a favor to the Chinese. It was a factor that Pakistan had been an intermediary,
                    that the Chinese and we were on the same side, and this would reinforce our new
                    opening to each other. However, in my view, it would have happened anyway, given
                    the general, geopolitical attitude of Nixon and Kissinger that if a stronger
                    power is opposed to a weaker power, you help out the weaker power in terms of
                    balance.</p>
                <p>Also, and for some time, frankly, we had been tilting toward Pakistan. There was
                    nothing new about this, in the sense that the Indians were generally closer to
                    the Russians, with the Pakistanis on the other side. So during the Cold War it
                    was natural for us to line up with Pakistan, at least in Kissinger's and Nixon's
                    view, representing geopolitics at the expense of human rights. There were
                    clearly a lot of atrocities in Bangladesh and so on. We didn't pay a great deal
                    of attention to them, which is an understatement.</p>
                <p>There was a genuine concern, and some suggestions from intelligence sources, that
                    India might go after Pakistan (West) aggressively, beyond its support of
                    Bangladesh. This, of course, would also affect peace and stability in the world.
                    It is unconscionable that one country should invade another country. So we
                    wanted to deter that. We had a variety of reasons, including the opening to
                    China and the Pakistani channel in support of that. However, that was not the
                    exclusive or predominant reason. During this period we had close discussions
                    with the Chinese, in our mutual interest, but also to underline again our
                    parallel, geopolitical convergence, having the Soviet dimension wrapped up in it
                    as well. We knew about China's concern about India and Chinese friendship for
                    Pakistan. This was an issue that we could cooperate on early in the course of
                    this opening of our relations, when we were trying to establish mutual trust and
                    confidence, in the sense of shared interests. So that was another issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>The Middle East was not a significant area. We would keep the Chinese posted on
                    what we were doing. What we got from the Chinese was essentially a pro-Arab
                    position, an anti-Israeli position. This is ironic because, later on, Israel
                    started giving the Chinese military aid, and so on. However, there wasn't fire
                    breathing rhetoric in China against Israel. It wasn't as if you were sitting in
                    Iran or Saudi Arabia. The Chinese view was that justice was on the side of the
                    Palestinians, so they took the side of the Arabs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Japan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Let me mention Japan. I think that we touched on that briefly before. I
                    know that we did, but we may benefit from a little repetition here. China and
                    Japan had a love-hate relationship, of course, given their history, culture, and
                    other things. There was the Rape of Nanking, and the Chinese are still resentful
                    of the Japanese invasion and thereby suspicious of the Japanese. They are
                    worried about Japan remilitarizing and/or going nuclear in the future. During
                    the first few visits to Beijing the China chided us about building up Japan, our
                    security alliance, and the presence of U.S. troops there. In their various
                    meetings Nixon and Kissinger made the counter-argument about our security
                    alliance with Japan and our nuclear umbrella. They made clear that the Japanese
                    were secure and that they didn't have to build up their own military forces or
                    nuclear potential, because the Japanese were safe, being allied with the U.S.
                    They said that it was not in China's interest that Japan worry about the
                    loosening of its alliance with the U.S., because they then might remilitarize,
                    go for nuclear weapons, and fulfill China's greatest fear.</p>
                <p>This is one, concrete example of the impact of extensive, geopolitical
                    discussions. People may say: “Hey, that's interesting, but what good is it going
                    to do?” In fact, these discussions had an impact. The Chinese began to
                    understand our arguments and dropped their attacks on our alliance with Japan,
                    and therefore created somewhat less mischief between us and Japan. So that was
                    important.</p>
                <p>Of course, once we moved to reopen our relations with China, Japan followed us
                    again and even went further with China, as they had every right to do for we had
                    held Tokyo back and then leap-frogged it. They normalized diplomatic relations
                    with China more quickly than we did.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, we were increasing our communications through two major channels - our
                    embassies in Paris and at the United Nations in New York. These were our
                    channels until we established liaison offices in early 1973.</p>
                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>I've mentioned that we went back to China in June, 1972, primarily to brief the
                    Chinese on the Soviet Summit Meeting and to press ahead with Vietnam, which was
                    still a major concern for us. On that trip we also went to Japan, one of many
                    Kissinger trips to Japan over the years. I sat in on a private meeting with
                    Prime Minister Sato, the only other American present. The trip in February,
                    1973, was the next one after June, 1972. Again we also went to Tokyo. I've
                    talked about the flavor and substance of all of these trips. The subsequent
                    trips were just to Beijing, except for ones where we went to Suzhou and Xian.
                    Also, we occasionally went to see the sights outside of Beijing.</p>
                <p>I want to mention the trip in February, 1973, since it is the last one I made
                    when I worked in the White House. It was a very successful trip, the best during
                    the whole Kissinger period. Until then we had awkward channeled communications
                    with China. We were building more trust with every trip. In fact, the Shanghai
                    Communique said that, from time to time, there should be a Senior Visitor from
                    the United States to China, which shows the mentality of the Middle Kingdom. We
                    were going there. They weren't coming our way. According to them, they couldn't
                    come to the United States, because there was still a Taiwan Embassy in
                    Washington. We were communicating through Huang Hua, the Chinese Ambassador to
                    the UN in New York, and through General Walters, our Defense Attache in our
                    Embassy in Paris.</p>
                <p>By the way, we would always drop in and see the Chinese Ambassador in Paris after
                    we had finished our secret negotiations on Vietnam with the North Vietnamese. We
                    would go over to the Chinese Embassy and give them a read-out on what had
                    happened. This was a courtesy to maintain contact. We would also talk about
                    other issues, but the primary object was to keep them up to speed on our Vietnam
                    negotiations and, hopefully, get their help in leaning on Hanoi.</p>
                <p>The trip to China in February, 1973, was the single most successful trip we ever
                    made to China, to develop convergence, at least. First of all, we had begun to
                    build up mutual trust and credibility through extensive discussions over several
                    trips. Kissinger had made three trips by then, in addition to the trip with
                    President Nixon. So there was mutual respect on the personal level and some
                    mutual confidence that we reinforced each other regarding South Asia, and so
                    forth. We had this perennial Russian factor, and all of that stuff. Secondly,
                    Nixon had just been reelected in a landslide, and China knew it would be dealing
                    with him for four more years, and that he planned to move towards
                    normalization.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, we had just ended the Vietnam War. So this irritant on the Chinese
                    border, this ideological awkwardness, and the fact that their so-called friends
                    were fighting us in a war were now behind us. They also knew that this would
                    free up our attitudes and resources, whether it involved countering the Soviets
                    or maintaining general, geopolitical balance and assertiveness. So this removed
                    a problem and a complication in our bilateral relationship. Also, public opinion
                    in both China and the U.S. was getting more comfortable with the
                    relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                <p>For all of these reasons, this was a very positive context in which to go to
                    China in February, 1973. As a result, it was the first time that Chairman Mao
                    saw Kissinger on his own, and that put the stamp on how important this was.</p>
                <p>We agreed in the February 1973 visit on getting over hurdles in terms of
                    communications. We also made an agreement on further economic progress and
                    cultural exchanges. On Taiwan the rhetoric was relatively restrained, I think.
                    However, the most important thing was that we agreed to set up Liaison Offices
                    in the two capitals. This was a clear indication of Chinese pragmatism as well
                    as their feeling more comfortable in terms of this relationship. They had said
                    that there would never be a Chinese Embassy in Washington as long as there was a
                    Taiwan Embassy. This was not acceptable to them, as this amounted to a Two
                    Chinas solution to the problem.</p>
                <p>We had tried on previous trips to suggest maybe setting up Trade Offices. We were
                    trying to come up with some formulation under which we would have direct
                    communications with the Chinese, even as we maintained our diplomatic relations
                    with Taiwan. The most forthcoming formulation which we had, and which I think
                    that the Chinese actually suggested, was a Liaison Office. I forget where that
                    phrase, Liaison Office, came from. So the Chinese agreed to the establishment of
                    Liaison Offices, which were Embassies in everything but name. They were big and
                    were going to get bigger. They could do any business that an Embassy could do.
                    So the Chinese could still say that they didn't have an Embassy in Washington
                    while Taiwan had an Embassy. However, in fact, the Chinese did have an office in
                    Washington simultaneously, and that was a major breakthrough.In addition on this
                    trip we secured the release of two American prisoners, CIA pilots, that the
                    Chinese had been holding since the Korean War.</p>
                <p>This trip therefore was extremely successful. The discussions were very rich. It
                    was on this trip that there was another example of Zhou En-lai's style, which
                    was very impressive. There were other reasons for being impressed with his
                    style, including his manner of speaking, elegance, his strategic and tactical
                    skill, his sense of history, his sense of humor, and his charisma. He was an
                    attractive person. The way he expressed himself was always elegant, as opposed
                    to being polemical. He once sent over his personal doctor to look after one of
                    our secretaries, who was sick. He had heard about this in casual conversation.
                    So he had these nice little touches, although obviously he was ruthless in being
                    able to get and stay where he was.</p>
                <p>Let me relate one interesting anecdote in this regard. By this time, Zhou En-lai
                    and Kissinger had built up a very warm relationship. Each of them defended his
                    own national interests, but they had great respect for each other. They had
                    tremendous conversations in which they would digress to talk about history,
                    philosophy, or whatever they wanted to discuss. So it was a very warm
                    relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>Every time we went to Beijing we stayed at the Diao Yu-tai guesthouse. Kissinger
                    and I, Holdridge, and sometimes others would walk around and talk strategy, just
                    to get a breath of fresh air and some exercise and get away from bugging devices
                    in our guesthouse. On this trip every time we would try to go over a certain
                    bridge, we were stopped by guards. We didn't know why. It turned out later that
                    Norodom Sihanouk or some other sensitive guest was staying there. At the time we
                    were sort of annoyed, because the whole compound, in which the guesthouse stood,
                    was sort of screened out and private. We could cross other bridges, but we just
                    kept getting blocked away from this particular bridge.</p>
                <p>Kissinger was puzzled. He either mentioned this matter to one of the Chinese - it
                    wasn't Zhou En-lai himself, but somebody else - or he was overheard in the
                    guesthouse. In any event, to make a long story short, on the final night, when
                    we finished our discussions, Kissinger and Zhou En-lai genuinely didn't want to
                    break up the meeting because they enjoyed each other's company so much. So we
                    went on for another couple of hours, talking about all kinds of things outside
                    the formal agenda.</p>
                <p>Then we finished. We were going to leave the next morning. It was a cold night.
                    Zhou En-lai said: “Well, why don't I walk you back to your guesthouse?” So he
                    took Kissinger and the rest of us back to the guesthouse, which was very
                    friendly in protocol terms. And lo and behold, we walked over that bridge! He
                    didn't say anything about it. But that was, of course, his gesture to Kissinger
                    on the personal level.</p>
                <p>Now, do you have any questions?</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Chas Freeman, in his oral history, suggests that Henry
                    Kissinger was resistant to the idea of a Liaison Office in Beijing.</p>
                <p>LORD: For what reason?</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Particularly because Kissinger reportedly felt that,
                    once you had State Department people based in Beijing, that he would lose
                    control of the relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>LORD: Again, memory plays tricks. That sounds like nonsense. We, including
                    Kissinger, wanted direct communications with the Chinese. I only remember that
                    Kissinger wanted to have the most ambitious arrangement that we could get away
                    with, without calling these offices Embassies. I clearly remember that he and I
                    felt that a Liaison Office was a trade off which was better than other
                    possibilities. Any office that you would set up was going to have State
                    Department people in it. Kissinger certainly might be suspicious of other
                    bureaucrats. However, to think that you could have any kind of de facto Embassy
                    without State Department people in it is absurd. Kissinger wanted to have
                    negotiations and direct contact with the Chinese, not to mention the signal this
                    sent around the world, including the Russians and the Vietnamese, that we were
                    advancing in our relationship with China. By that time the Vietnamese probably
                    felt that this issue was irrelevant. It's absurd to say that we didn't want a
                    Liaison Office. I am puzzled by that reference. I don't know how Freeman could
                    come up with it. To be sure, since we set up Liaison Office, Kissinger exercised
                    tight control and was always the key link in our ties with Beijing.</p>
                <p>Who else suggested this resistance?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Roger Sullivan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: He may have come up with a formulation; I don't remember where it came
                    from. By then we were involving the State Department and asking for ideas.
                    Someone may have suggested using the name of a Liaison Office. I don't deny
                    that. I just don't recall where this term came from. And I really have trouble
                    believing that Kissinger would have resisted setting up a Liaison Office. It
                    just doesn't make any sense. We were delighted to have a Liaison Office, and we
                    knew that any such office would have State Department people in it.</p>
                <p>Now, of course, there was also the matter of heads of the U.S. Liaison Office in
                    Beijing. One of the first two people heading it up was John Holdridge, one of
                    Kissinger's NSC staff members. The other one was Al Jenkins from State. So
                    clearly, Kissinger wasn't going to let these people operate on their own. I
                    don't deny that. It's absurd to say that he wouldn't want a Liaison Office. It
                    just doesn't make any sense.</p>
                <p>Q: We'll stop at this point. The next time we'll cover Vietnam from the NSC
                    perspective. I would like to note that we have covered the Chinese connection
                    and also the Chinese role in Vietnam, India, the Soviet Union, and Japan in this
                    interview.</p>
                <p>LORD: We've gone through the Kissinger secret trip to China and the preparations
                    for it, the rationale for the opening to China, the Nixon and subsequent trips,
                    and some of the discussions and considerations we had on various issues, as well
                    as some personal anecdotes and some on styles.</p>

                <p>I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. This is June 23, 1998. We will continue to follow
                    the China thread. Nancy Bernkopf Tucker is also participating in this interview.
                    Win, you said that there are a couple of things that you wanted to add to the
                    material on your experience on the NSC [National Security Council] staff.</p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, we're still covering China during my days on the NSC staff. I want to
                    go back over a couple of the trips to China, after the trip by President Nixon
                    [in February, 1972]. It may be repetitious, but I want to make sure that it is
                    covered.</p>
                <p>In June, 1972, and I don't know whether we covered this in depth. Kissinger went
                    back to China on the first trip after President Nixon's trip in February, 1972.
                    We made further progress on the relationship between the People's Republic of
                    China and the United States, generally. Two main items on the June, 1972, trip
                    were to debrief the Chinese on President Nixon's trip to Moscow and the Summit
                    Meeting with the Soviets, and we also wanted to keep working on the Vietnam
                    issue. We particularly wanted to get Chinese help in the negotiations with
                    Hanoi.</p>
                <p>As always, there were broad ranging discussions between Kissinger and Zhou Enlai.
                    There was a whole variety of issues on the agenda, most of which we discussed in
                    our previous session. There were some nice, warm touches here because,
                    obviously, the relationships between Kissinger and Zhou Enlai and the
                    relationship between the two countries, although they were in their infancy,
                    were obviously beginning to become more friendly. There was a very pleasant
                    meeting with Zhou Enlai. I think that Zhou Enlai was there personally on the
                    boat trip, the visit to the Summer Palace, and the trip to the hills surrounding
                    Beijing.</p>
                <p>There was also one difficult issue, which was handled with some restraint by the
                    Chinese. Zhou Enlai showed us pictures of some bombs which had accidentally
                    landed on Chinese soil. These must have been connected to the fighting in
                    Vietnam. I don't recall that this ever became public knowledge or that the
                    Chinese made a big deal out of it. It was quite interesting that they didn't
                    make a major issue out of it.</p>
                <p>Q: Were flights over Hainan Island prohibited? This is something that has come up
                    from time to time. People who were with the Office of the Political Adviser to
                    CINCPAC [CINCPAC POLAD] have told us that there were problems with overflights
                    of China during the Vietnam War.</p>
                <pb facs="0204" n="Page0204"/>
                <p>LORD: I don't recall. I remember that the Chinese on this occasion were concerned
                    about bombs actually falling on Chinese territory. I don't imagine that out
                    aircraft went out of their way to overfly China. I don't know whether we
                    accidentally did so or not. Anyway, the Chinese did not raise this issue as
                    such. It was the reference to bombs falling on Chinese territory that seemed to
                    concern them.</p>
                <p>This was also the trip where I was greatly embarrassed because of a table tennis
                    exhibition. Kissinger had rashly told Zhou that I was a good player. A few days
                    later the Chinese sprung a match between me and the Chinese champion on one side
                    and Dick Solomon and the world champion on the other. I played badly. The
                    results remain classified.</p>
                <p>Without being specific on the chronology, how did we keep in touch with the
                    Chinese after the Nixon trip [in February, 1972]? We had no direct contact at
                    all with the Chinese before the Kissinger secret trip [in 1971]. We had to go
                    through Pakistan. After the first Kissinger trip, we had two basic channels. One
                    was through the Chinese UN Ambassador in New York, a man named Huang Hua, who
                    subsequently became Foreign Minister of the PRC [People's Republic of China].
                    Kissinger and myself, sometimes I alone, sometimes Al Haig and I, in various
                    combinations, would go up to New York and meet, usually in a safe house, right
                    near where I had grown up as a child, on Park Avenue and the 70s, to discuss
                    various issues. I remember that we kept in touch in this way during the
                    1971South Asian crisis, although my chronology is not precise.</p>
                <p>In these meetings in New York we continued to talk about bilateral relations, our
                    respective relations with Russia, and, of course, Vietnam. I remember
                    specifically that I went up to New York on my own in April, 1972, when Hanoi
                    launched its offensive just before President Nixon went to Moscow for the Summit
                    Meeting with the Soviets.</p>
                <p>The other channel was through Paris. The Chinese Ambassador there was a man named
                    Huang Zhen, who subsequently became chief of the PRC Liaison Office and
                    Ambassador to the U.S. That was a secret contact. Every time that we met with
                    the Vietnamese in secret negotiations, which we'll get to later, we would go
                    over and debrief Huang Zhen, at least during this period, to keep the Chinese
                    posted on how we were doing with the Vietnamese. Obviously, this was done in the
                    hope that they would try to be helpful in encouraging Hanoi to take reasonable
                    positions.</p>
                <p>At these meetings with the Chinese in Paris we would also discuss bilateral
                    matters as well. There was a portrait of Mao Zedong in the PRC Embassy. There
                    was incense burning. We had good, Chinese food when we went there, and so on. So
                    those are some incidental points.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Could I ask something? You were briefing the Chinese
                    on what you were discussing with the Russians. Was there a sense of confidence
                    on the part of the Chinese that you were telling them everything, or how did
                    they...</p>
                <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                <p>LORD: Well, it was not in the style of the Chinese to tell us that they didn't
                    think that we were telling them everything. Nor would they show gratitude at our
                    being forthcoming in briefing them. They listened to us with interest. I don't
                    recall that they probed us with a lot of questions; they would not want to show
                    their eagerness. Mostly, they just listened to what we said.</p>
                <p>Indeed, I don't recall whether this began with the trip in June, [1972], but
                    certainly by February, 1973, we began to brief them on Russian deployments [on
                    the Chinese border]. Often I would go off with Jon Howe or some military expert
                    to talk with the Chinese. We would discuss Russian troop levels near the Chinese
                    border and related things. By this means we sought to gain the confidence of the
                    Chinese and to show that we were willing to enter into a new relationship with
                    them.</p>
                <p>In their dealings with us they did not reciprocate greatly in terms of their
                    relations with Russia. On the other hand, they did not have much to offer.
                    Relations between Russia and China were pretty frosty at this point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: I was going to ask at what point
                        thebegan to provide us with information as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, whether it was Russia, the Middle East, or Vietnam, for a long period
                    of time we generally gave them a lot more than they gave us in terms of these
                    intelligence exchanges, although these began to be more mutual as time went on.
                    We didn't consider the intelligence exchanges as a zero sum game. First of all,
                    we thought that we knew more than the Chinese did on most of these issues.
                    Secondly, we hoped to get more out of them, and we encouraged them to do so, but
                    we didn't get a great deal. However, we felt that even the unilateral,
                    intelligence briefings would give them a greater stake in the emerging
                    relationship with the United States which, after all, was still somewhat fragile
                    after some 22 years of hostility between our two countries. We hoped that our
                    efforts would show them that we regarded them as a more friendly, strategic
                    partner.</p>
                <p>Specifically, if there were any arguments in the Chinese Politburo about the
                    opening to the U.S., we hoped to help those in favor of such an opening, like
                    Mao and Zhou En-lai. We also hoped generally to indicate to the Chinese that we
                    were not na�ve about the Russians but were willing to share information about
                    the Russians with the Chinese. Furthermore, we also made it clear that we wanted
                    to improve relations with Russia as well. We made it clear that we would not do
                    this at Chinese expense but that it was in our national interest as well. We
                    said that we were not about to form a tight, anti-Soviet alliance with China,
                    any more than we would gang up with Russia against China.</p>
                <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                <p>We wanted to strike a balance, making it clear that we were as suspicious of the
                    Russians as they were. After all, this was one of the main reasons for the
                    opening to China. We also wanted to keep the Chinese sufficiently on edge so
                    that we might improve relations with Russia, right after improving relations
                    with China. This was to give the Chinese an incentive to improve relations with
                    us. This was the usual triangular game.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you talk about the use of a weapon which we seem to have used quite a
                    bit during that period and subsequently? And maybe before, as well. That is, the
                    use of satellite pictures and photo interpretation. This seems to have become a
                    major tool in our diplomacy, in the sense of telling another country, see what
                    we have to show you from our bag of tricks. Nobody else was in a position to do
                    this.</p>
                <p>LORD: Some of this material is still in a twilight zone of classification. I
                    would not be shocking anyone any more than it would have shocked Rick, to use
                    the line from the movie “Casablanca,” when he was told by the French Chief of
                    Police that there was gambling going on in his night club. We began to present
                    verbal and written briefings. As time went on, there were pictures added, and so
                    on. We will also go into this later. However, of course, this began in earnest
                    during the Carter administration, when more strategic cooperation was undertaken
                    with the Chinese with respect to tracking Soviet missile activity, not to
                    mention sharing intelligence and cooperation on Afghanistan and other areas.</p>
                <p>Yes, satellite pictures were used as we went on. I don't think thawe had reached
                    that point during the period I am talking about.</p>
                <p>The only other thing that I have to cover before we go on, unless you have other
                    questions, would be to review what we covered during the trip to China in
                    February, 1973. I really would not want to repeat all of that. I think that we
                    covered most of it, but I ought to mention the meeting with Mao.</p>
                <p>As I said briefly, the meeting with Mao in February, 1973, was Kissinger's first
                    meeting with him. I remember that we were sitting late at night with Zhou Enlai
                    at about 11:00 PM. Wang Hairong, I might repeat, was Mao's grandniece. She kept
                    coming in and going out, bearing notes to and from Zhou Enlai. Finally, Zhou
                    said something to the effect that Chairman Mao would like to see Dr. Kissinger
                    and that Mr. Lord was invited as well. Or Zhou said that Dr. Kissinger could be
                    accompanied by Mr. Lord, or words to that effect.</p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>This is typical of Chinese, partially Zhou's, style. The Chinese knew, of course,
                    as we discussed earlier, that I had attended the first Mao meeting with Nixon
                    but that I was cut out of all of the pictures and the communique because of the
                    sensitivities of the State Department. The Chinese also knew that Kissinger
                    relied on me the most on Chinese matters. There were other very, very important
                    people in our delegation, but I had been involved the most on such matters and
                    was Kissinger's closest assistant at that point, both generally and on China.
                    Therefore, the Chinese knew that Kissinger would probably want me in any meeting
                    he would have with Mao.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, there was a protocol problem. There were other American
                    officials sitting there, whose names I cannot immediately recall all of whom
                    were higher ranking than I. Therefore, it would be very awkward to include me as
                    one of the more junior people if Kissinger could only take one person with him.
                    So what the Chinese did to avoid any possible controversy was to say that Mao
                    wanted to see Kissinger and that I might accompany him to this meeting. This was
                    absurd in substance because Mao would not have known me from Michael Jordan
                    [star basketball player for the Chicago Bulls professional basketball team].
                    This meant that Kissinger was relieved from having to choose who would go with
                    him to the meeting with Mao. He got the person that he wanted to go with him. I
                    was rewarded with being included in a public meeting with Mao to make up for the
                    fact that nobody knew that I was in the private meeting with Mao. I had been in
                    the other meeting between Kissinger and Mao, but my picture had been cut out of
                    the official photograph. That was a nice, grace point by the Chinese.</p>
                <p>We went over to meet with Mao. I think that the meeting lasted about an hour and
                    a half. It ended at 1:30 AM, in any event. The conversation was wide-ranging,
                    and I'll get back to that. For the first time Mao used the expression: “I'll
                    soon be receiving an invitation from God.” I hadn't realized that Mao used this
                    expression that far back but I double checked it in Kissinger's book. This was
                    Mao's way of saying that he was quite sick and did not expect to live much
                    longer. He said: “God,” and not Marx. This phrase was used in the visit between
                    President Ford and Mao a year and a half later.</p>
                <p>Also, Mao kept mentioning that women were causing problems in China or at least
                    saying that China could send the U.S. 10 million women. This was not just
                    playing around with the phony story that Kissinger was allegedly popular with
                    females. At the time we couldn't figure out what Mao meant by this statement
                    that he could send us 10 million women. When we got home, I asked my wife, a
                    Chinese woman born in Shanghai. She immediately said that Mao was having
                    problems on policy issues, including perhaps the opening with the U.S., with
                    some of the Chinese radicals, including his wife, Mme. Mao. In effect, he was
                    saying that he was having trouble with the radicals, including his wife. Mao
                    spoke, using allusions, metaphors, and similes. His Socratic dialogue manner of
                    expressing himself was never very explicit on some of these things. My wife's
                    view seemed to make sense to Kissinger and me.</p>
                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>Mao's basic thesis at this meeting was that China and the U.S. had been enemies
                    and that we would probably continue to fire propaganda shots at each other.
                    However, these slogans really didn't mean anything. What really counted were
                    longer range, national interests and far sightedness. Neither side should
                    maneuver for petty advantage. We should put national interests above ideological
                    differences.</p>
                <p>Even this early the Chinese began, through Mao, although I don't know whether
                    Zhou En-lai did this as much, to warn us about fake detente. The remarks didn't
                    have sharp edges of the kind we heard later in the mid-1970s, particularly
                    during the 1974-1975 period up to and during the time of the visit to China by
                    President Ford. Mao's point was that we should not be hoodwinked by the
                    Russians. This theme was introduced. There was also emphasis by Mao that there
                    was a need for U.S. leadership in the world and that we should pay attention to
                    our allies, including Europe, Japan, Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey. So that was
                    that.</p>
                <p>Q: We're still talking about the China thread and the period of your service on
                    the NSC staff. There was a lot of euphoria, and this was all very exciting. Was
                    there an undercurrent, discernible to you, about a build-up of the old China
                    Lobby in the United States, including people from the Right Wing who really
                    didn't like China? Was this a factor in Mao's thinking?</p>
                <p>LORD: Actually, no. In fact, just the opposite. In our relations with China and
                    our perceptions of that country, we have a history of swinging from one extreme
                    to another. This goes back to American missionaries and the Boxer Rebellion [in
                    the early 20th century] in reaction to the American missionaries. Even during
                    the last 50 to 60 years the Chinese have tended to be portrayed either as evil,
                    Fu Man Chus [a fictional character] or as noble peasants depicted by Pearl Buck
                    in her novels. During this same period we were staunch allies of the Chinese
                    during World War II. Then the Communists took over China, and we actually fought
                    against them in Korea. We had images of the Chinese as yellow hordes, red
                    guards, and blue ants working for Mao. The Cultural Revolution greatly enhanced
                    these negative images. Then we had the dramatic opening of our relations with
                    Kissinger and Nixon. The press coverage of China, on the whole, and the general
                    reaction back in the US during the opening in the early 1970s attracted euphoria
                    and tremendous support for the opening to China, much to our relief, despite 22
                    years of hostility and bad images of China. There still were people concerned
                    about China, but there was great popular, Congressional and media support for
                    the opening.</p>
                <pb facs="0209" n="Page0209"/>
                <p>If anything, in visiting China President Nixon not only did something which was
                    geopolitically correct but exceeded any of our expectations to domestic support.
                    I think that the opening to China was very popular. I think that we all
                    recollect it that way. So we all did not feel very much constrained in terms of
                    the Right Wing or people being overly nervous about this process. There was
                    tremendous support for what Nixon did. And this policy has always been cited as
                    Nixon's most significant achievement as PresidentOf course, this swinging back
                    and forth in American opinion has continued ever since then. A few journalists
                    at the time, such as Bill Buckley, Marilyn Berger, and some others, had doubts
                    about the opening or whether China was as relatively benign as some visitors
                    portrayed it. We didn't realize at the time how bad the Cultural Revolution was.
                    As Americans began to work and live in China as journalists and academics and
                    businesspeople, we began to learn about the horrors of the Cultural Revolution.
                    Actually, this didn't officially end until 1976 but the late '60s saw the worst
                    excesses. These accounts began to come out. Then we had the Deng Xiaoping
                    take-over in 1978, the reforms, and the normalization of Chinese-American
                    relations. Once again, we had accounts that China was going capitalist, and many
                    became overly sanguine. Then, just as things were developing in a positive
                    direction, we reached the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989, which greatly set
                    back Chinese-American relations and still is a major problem in our
                    relationship, not to mention the disappearance of the Soviet threat. Even as we
                    speak, President Clinton is about to go to China again.</p>
                <p>But to repeat, we didn't feel any constraints about the domestic impact of our
                    policies toward China. Of course, we were still very careful about the Taiwan
                    issue and the matter of friendship with Taiwan. That was and is still a very
                    important issue in terms of our domestic politics, as well as our reputation as
                    a friend and ally. On that issue we were careful, especially during the Ford
                    years. However, on the whole, we didn't feel much political constraint on our
                    relations with China.</p>
                <p>Another out of sequence footnote: during the October, 1971, trip, there was the
                    embarrassing issue of postponing our departure for China from a day. President
                    Nixon was concerned about the timing of the UN debate on the Chinese
                    representation issue. [That is, whether the China seat at the UN would be
                    occupied by representatives of the People's Republic of China or the
                    anti-communist Republic of China on Taiwan.] I forget why President Nixon wanted
                    us to postpone our departure from China. In any event, we learned about Taiwan
                    being kicked out of the UN and the PRC being admitted to the UN even as we were
                    flying out of Shanghai in October, 1971. That UN vote was awkward on the
                    domestic front.</p>

                <p>Q: This is December 8, 1998. We've agreed not to go into the profiles of major
                    figures in the Clinton administration in this portion of the interview. We'll
                    stick to people in the NSC [National Security Council], especially those working
                    on Vietnam, and Indochina. When were you in the NSC?</p>
                <p>LORD: I came to the NSC in February, 1969. I spent the first year of my time
                    there on the Planning Staff in the Executive Office Building, working directly
                    for Mort Halperin but also with direct interaction with then National Security
                    Adviser Kissinger. Then, in February, 1970, I was appointed Special Assistant to
                    Kissinger, at a time when Tony Lake and Roger Morris, who were performing those
                    functions, were planning to leave the NSC. They were in their final months on
                    the NSC. So I became Special Assistant to Kissinger and moved over to the White
                    House basement and worked out of there during the remainder of my time on the
                    NSC, until May, 1973.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk about your involvement in Indochina, using that term, to begin
                    with. That covers all three countries, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. At the time
                    when you began your employment on the NSC, how did you feel about the whole
                    business?</p>
                <p>LORD: That's exactly where I thought we should start. During the 1960s we as a
                    nation obviously became more and more involved in the Vietnam War. I was
                    essentially on the moderately hawkish side, not on the extreme, hawkish side.
                    From 1961 up till 1967 I felt generally hawkish as a Foreign Service Officer.
                    Then in the Pentagon, where I worked from 1967 till 1969, I essentially defended
                    the U.S. involvement in Vietnam. I'll come back later to how my views changed
                    with time. I believed that, whatever the excesses, our involvement in Vietnam
                    was obviously in support of a noble cause, in the defense of South Vietnam
                    against North Vietnamese aggression. I was not overly hawkish in the sense of
                    advocating the flattening of Hanoi or going out of our way to inflict damage on
                    North Vietnam. However, in the evolving debate I generally defended the U.S.
                    involvement, essentially for the reasons set forth by the administration. That
                    is, in the defense of our security interests, the defense of freedom, and so
                    on.</p>
                <p>That was my basic view when I was in Geneva from 1965 to 1967, for example, as a
                    Foreign Service Officer and as I entered the Pentagon. In the debate then raging
                    I was strongly against those who would accuse the U.S. of carrying on an immoral
                    war and who glorified the Viet Cong and/or the North Vietnamese. I would have
                    respectful debates with those who understood the nefarious nature of the Viet
                    Cong and North Vietnam but nevertheless felt that in defense of American
                    national interests and holding together American society, our involvement in
                    Vietnam was a mistake. I could debate honestly with those who felt, on grounds
                    of hardheaded national interests, that we shouldn't be in Vietnam, that our
                    involvement was distracting us from other important priorities around the world,
                    that it was undermining our social cohesion at home, and so forth. However, I
                    was in violent disagreement with those who called our involvement in Vietnam
                    immoral and who tended to elevate the enemy in relative virtue.</p>
                <pb facs="0211" n="Page0211"/>
                <p>When I worked at the Pentagon, I did some work on Vietnam. I was on the Policy
                    Planning Staff, as we discussed before, and I covered a lot of ground, including
                    Asia generally. We did some extensive work on what our policies in Asia should
                    look like after the end of the Vietnam War, on the assumption of various
                    outcomes, such as a clear-cut American and South Vietnamese victory, an
                    ambiguous outcome, or a loss. We were just looking ahead after the end of the
                    Vietnam War.</p>
                <p>I recall working with my colleagues, including certainly Mort Halperin and Les
                    Gelb, who were heavily involved in following the Vietnam War. Indeed, Gelb
                    headed the project called “The Pentagon Papers,” which looked at our past
                    involvement in Vietnam. They were on the dovish side but were not extreme doves.
                    They felt that the American military and others were too optimistic about how
                    things were going in Vietnam and that we should step up our efforts to negotiate
                    with the communist side. They strongly supported Clark Clifford, when he came in
                    as Secretary of Defense, replacing Robert McNamara. He began to turn our
                    policies around and worked on President Lyndon Johnson in calling for bombing
                    halts and in starting negotiations.</p>
                <p>To the extent that U.S. policy on Vietnam began shifting under the Johnson
                    administration with Clifford, the policies advocated by Halperin and Gelb had a
                    lot to do with it. I was not central to that effort, although I do recall having
                    exchanges of views with them in the preparation of papers in support of what
                    they advocated.</p>
                <p>By then I was more moderate in my position. I began to see that the struggle was
                    taking a lot of time and heavy losses abroad and at home, and that some of our
                    estimates of the situation were overly optimistic. I certainly was in favor of
                    serious negotiations, although not in favor of a sell-out or a unilateral U.S.
                    capitulation to the communists. I felt that negotiations were important. I think
                    that it is fair to say that in 1967 and 1968 I began to moderate my views but
                    still defended the U.S. involvement, although I felt that we should pursue
                    negotiations with the other side, if at all possible.</p>
                <p>Then came an event which had a major impact on my perspectives on Vietnam. That
                    was the Tet [Vietnamese lunar New Year] offensive [beginning in January, 1968].
                    Most people agree in retrospect that, in strictly military terms, the Viet Cong
                    [Vietnamese communists in South Vietnam] in particular and the North Vietnamese
                    suffered a military defeat during the Tet offensive. Many of their troops were
                    wiped out. Whatever gains they made were temporary, they were thrown back.
                    However, virtually everyone I spoke to also agreed that the Tet offensive had a
                    tremendous, psychological impact on the American public and on many American
                    Government officials, in the sense that it demonstrated that the Viet Cong and
                    North Vietnamese could mount significant attacks, even in the heart of Saigon
                    and in other, major cities of South Vietnam. Even though they were defeated, it
                    showed that our previous, optimistic scenarios had been less than accurate.</p>
                <pb facs="0212" n="Page0212"/>
                <p>What had a particular impact on me (and others) was a cable coming in from Saigon
                    in which General Westmoreland [Commander of the Military Assistance Command
                    Vietnam or COMUSMACV] requested a further, major reinforcement of our forces. I
                    don't remember the exact date, but it came in after the Tet offensive. We'll
                    have to go back and check the figure, but it was for 150,000 troops, I
                    believe.</p>
                <p>This request had a major impact. We had previously thought that things were going
                    along quite well in South Vietnam, but I was beginning to moderate my view on
                    that. I now began to think that the situation in South Vietnam was very serious,
                    when a communist offensive of that size could be mounted. At the time we didn't
                    realize how much the Viet Cong had suffered, but still, the psychological and
                    political impact in the United States was substantial. When General
                    Westmoreland, who was fairly optimistic himself, reported that he needed another
                    150,000 troops, I began to wonder what was happening in Vietnam. I really took a
                    turn toward a more critical position. I began to be more dovish, although not
                    with an extremely dovish position.</p>
                <p>This was also around the time that Clark Clifford came in as Secretary of
                    Defense. I think that it's fair to say that in 1968, especially after the Tet
                    offensive, I moved toward a more dovish position. What I mean by that is that,
                    if I had been serving outside of the government, I would have been considered
                    more centrist, essentially defending American policy but urging a negotiated
                    solution if at all possible. I was still in fundamental disagreement with those
                    who considered American policy in Vietnam as immoral and our enemies as heroes.
                    Within the government I would certainly have been on the dovish side of the
                    debate. We'll see that further as we go ahead over the following years.</p>
                <p>As I went to the White House and to the NSC [National Security Council] in
                    February, 1969, my position essentially was that we ought to try to negotiate an
                    end to the Vietnam War but on honorable terms. In the coming years, I had some
                    internal debates along the way in my own mind and with Kissinger about tactical
                    moves, military escalation, and the Cambodian incursion. We'll get into points
                    where I disagreed with some of the policies followed. However, I have to say
                    that I was sufficiently comfortable with the Nixon/Kissinger strategic approach
                    including Vietnamization and the search for a negotiated solution that I never
                    left my job in protest, as some of my colleagues did. I will go into that in
                    more detail as we go along.</p>
                <p>The essential Nixon/Kissinger approach was as follows. First, they had inherited
                    this war and the American involvement in it from their predecessors in previous
                    administrations, which had been controlled by the Democratic Party. As they came
                    into office, we had about 585,000 troops in Vietnam. Whatever the intentions
                    behind that escalating involvement over the years, Nixon and Kissinger were
                    presented with a fait accompli, which they could not undo.</p>
                <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                <p>So, on the one hand, it was possible, politically, for President Nixon to admit
                    that our involvement in the Vietnam War had been a huge mistake made by his
                    predecessors in the Democratic Party. He could have said that he was getting out
                    of this involvement, limiting the damage as much as possible and blaming it on
                    his predecessors.</p>
                <p>However, by genuine conviction Nixon and Kissinger felt that this would be a huge
                    mistake which would undermine our credibility in the world generally and would
                    dismay our friends and allies. They would come to question our staying power and
                    credibility as a friend. This course of action could lead to the spread of
                    communism. I don't know whether they subscribed automatically to the domino
                    theory, but they felt that a clear-cut communist victory and U.S. capitulation
                    in Indochina would spread throughout Southeast Asia and would generally
                    undermine our credibility in the world. They felt that, whatever the
                    shortcomings of the South Vietnamese regime, there was North Vietnamese
                    aggression as opposed to a simple, civil conflict, and there were international
                    rules about how to settle conflicts as well as a feeling that we would be
                    leaving people in the lurch who had opposed this aggression. So Nixon and
                    Kissinger had no sentiment, and this was the view in the cabinet generally, that
                    we could just announce the we were going to get out and go home.</p>
                <p>On the other hand Nixon and Kissinger, as well as others, certainly felt that the
                    Vietnam War was tearing our society apart and that we had other obligations in
                    the world the resources for which were being drained by our military, financial,
                    and diplomatic defense of South Vietnam. There were many things that they wanted
                    to do in the world. Therefore, if our withdrawal from Vietnam could be
                    accomplished with honor, it would be in our interest to do so.</p>
                <p>As I think that I mentioned elsewhere, I think that President Nixon felt in
                    particular that the Russians could be helpful in ending the Vietnam War. He
                    mentioned that he had a secret plan for ending the war, which he talked about
                    during the 1968 presidential elections campaign, and involving the Russians was
                    what he was referring to.</p>
                <p>Kissinger believed that Russia and China, and Nixon felt this as well, could be
                    helpful in at least isolating North Vietnam psychologically, if not in terms of
                    military aid. They felt that improving our relations with Russia and China might
                    help to put pressure on Hanoi to negotiate reasonably. Also, Russia and China
                    might have a greater stake in improving their bilateral relations with us,
                    rather than standing by their so-called friends and allies in Hanoi. But Nixon
                    always put more emphasis, and hope in, Russia's help than Kissinger did. He was
                    more inclined to tie other elements of our dealings with Moscow to Vietnam than
                    Kissinger was.</p>
                <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                <p>The basic strategy that was devised during the early months of the first Nixon
                    term in 1969 involved two threads. One key element was the Vietnamization of the
                    war. That is, turning over to the South Vietnamese the major responsibility for
                    their own defense. It was a Nixon/Kissinger strategy, but it had the strong
                    support of Secretary of Defense Laird, Secretary of State Rogers, and others.
                    For several reasons they concluded that we should begin to Vietnamize or
                    De-Americanize the war. This involved turning over responsibility for the
                    conduct of the war to the South Vietnamese, but at a pace that was bearable. We
                    had spent a lot of time and effort, as well as American blood and treasure, in
                    helping the South Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>First, Nixon and Kissinger felt that it was time for the South Vietnamese to
                    assume more of the burden, in terms of justice and American domestic support.
                    Secondly, they felt that, if this process were accomplished gradually, it was
                    doable. We would strengthen the South Vietnamese through the provision of
                    training and military aid. Gradually, American troop withdrawals, military
                    assistance, and training would make it possible for the South Vietnamese to
                    assume more of the burden.</p>
                <p>Third, this process would show the American people that there would be an end, at
                    some point, to our involvement and that we were at least heading in the
                    direction of ending our involvement in an honorable way. It was felt that, in
                    this way, we could maintain American domestic and Congressional support for
                    continued American involvement and aid to South Vietnam. We could say that South
                    Vietnam was taking on more of the responsibility, while American involvement and
                    casualties would gradually be reduced. So this was a way to maintain domestic
                    support for our Vietnam policies. That was one track, and a very important one
                    at the time.</p>
                <p>The other track was simultaneously to try to negotiate an end to the conflict and
                    by applying military pressure, if necessary, to show Hanoi that they couldn't
                    win and that negotiations were in their interests. We sought to couple that
                    effort, as we went on, with Russian and Chinese help. We also believed that by
                    making progress on the negotiations, Hanoi would see that it was in their
                    interest to bring the war to an end. This was a version of the carrot and the
                    stick, as it were.I did not become aware of the serious aspect of the secret
                    negotiations with North Vietnam until I became a Special Assistant to National
                    Security Adviser Henry Kissinger in February, 1970. Prior to that time, I was
                    not aware of the secret talks with North Vietnam. There had been only one round
                    of secret talks (August 1969) before I became a Special Assistant to Kissinger.
                    There were three more (February, March, April 1970) that Tony Lake handled. I
                    was involved in every one of the secret and semi-public talks with the North
                    Vietnamese after that. I took part in all of the discussions from September 1970
                    to the signing of the peace agreement in January 1973. Some of those in 1972-'73
                    were announced right after we held them; the total was nineteen, with most of
                    the later ones lasting several days.</p>

                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>LORD: Let me complete this conceptual description of the situation. It seemed to
                    me, even in 1969, when I wasn't aware of the secret negotiations, that the
                    combination of Vietnamization and the drawdown of American involvement in
                    Vietnam, as well as our public efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict, was
                    a reasonable approach to the problem. It was one that I could live with, despite
                    my somewhat dovish tendencies. It promised an end to the conflict. In any case,
                    it was done at a pace that did not sell out our allies. It would mean a decline
                    in American casualties. I still was sufficiently in the center that I did not
                    want to see America collapse or see American credibility undermined. I
                    recognized that, however imperfect the South Vietnamese were, the Viet Cong and
                    the North Vietnamese were even nastier.</p>
                <p>The problem with this two track approach, which Kissinger himself acknowledged,
                    was that there was some tension and contradiction in it. This mainly involved
                    the question of what incentives Hanoi had to negotiate seriously with us when
                    they saw, in any event, that we were reducing our involvement and that
                    Vietnamization meant that we would be pulling our troops out. So why shouldn't
                    Hanoi just wait until the Americans had sufficiently withdrawn so that the South
                    Vietnamese were on their own and sufficiently weak so that North Vietnam could
                    win, anyway? What incentive did North Vietnam have to give up positions to get
                    U.S. withdrawal, when they were going to get a U.S. withdrawal, anyway?</p>
                <p>The analytical response to that was that the withdrawals would be fast enough to
                    maintain U.S. domestic support but slow enough to allow the South Vietnamese
                    time to adjust and take on the North Vietnamese. Therefore, we would hope that
                    North Vietnam would calculate that American domestic support wouldn't collapse.
                    They would see that there was support for this approach and therefore that it
                    was against the North Vietnamese interest over the long haul to continue to
                    fight but not negotiate seriously. Secondly, with our help South Vietnam would
                    be formidable enough to take on North Vietnam. Therefore, North Vietnam would be
                    better off trying to get a negotiated deal. However, there was always this
                    tension concerning our major bargaining chip, the U.S. troop presence, which was
                    being withdrawn as a result of Vietnamization, no matter what happened at the
                    bargaining table.</p>
                <p>Q: I wonder if you could tell me whether you felt that you were being put through
                    a litmus test about where you stood on Vietnam when you took this position on
                    the NSC staff? What about your fellow officers on the NSC at this early time?
                    What was the atmosphere as this debate went on?</p>
                <p>LORD: We have already covered the situation when I was interviewed by Kissinger
                    for the job on the NSC. He focused on my discretion and my loyalty to President
                    Nixon. We did not get into substantive issues. This was somewhat of a rushed
                    meeting.</p>
                <pb facs="0216" n="Page0216"/>
                <p>In fairness to Kissinger, the one thing that he did not like was yes men or yes
                    women, for that matter. He wanted debate, as long as it was intellectually
                    adroit and not just pap. I'll get to this in a minute. So he did not apply a
                    litmus test to me or to others on his staff. I'm quite sure that he knew then
                    that some of the staff that he was hiring, including Mort Halperin, were quite
                    dovish on some of these subjects, as were Tony Lake and Morris, who were among
                    his key people. So in fairness to Kissinger, he just didn't hire hawkish people.
                    Indeed, some of President Nixon's White House staff were suspicious that the NSC
                    staff was overly moderate and liberal. There was just no litmus test in use.
                    Indeed, along the way and in verbal discussions, I would argue with Kissinger on
                    some of our policies, usually coming at him from a dovish standpoint. But this
                    took place within a framework that an honest effort was being made to negotiate
                    an end to the Vietnam War, particularly when I became involved in the secret
                    negotiations.</p>
                <p>With respect to others, I think that it's fair to say that people like Mort
                    Halperin, Tony Lake, and Morris, as I think that I mentioned, were somewhat more
                    dovish than I was. I think that we may be parsing words here, but they were
                    essentially in the same position as I've described. They were a little more
                    dovish than I was. Other people on the NSC staff were more hawkish. Al Haig, who
                    was a military officer and eventually became Kissinger's deputy, was more on the
                    hawkish side.</p>
                <p>Regarding a few of the Vietnam experts that I worked with in the course of these
                    several years, I would say that Dick Smyser was about in the same position as I
                    was. John Negroponte was more hawkish. Then there were people like Larry Lynn,
                    who was essentially involved in systems analysis, program budgeting, and so
                    forth. He would look at issues from a systems analysis aspect. In other words,
                    how well were we doing on the ground? He was somewhat detached. He didn't get
                    overly emotional about the issues under debate. He would look at them in a hard
                    headed way as an analyst in terms of how we were doing. It would be hard to type
                    him.</p>
                <p>There were different people on the NSC staff. However, the key people working on
                    Vietnam were either about where Kissinger was or were somewhat more dovish, with
                    the exception of Al Haig, who was somewhat more hawkish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to go on with your narrative. It seems to me, as
                        you describe the situation, that there were two, critical elements regarding
                        how to end our involvement in the Vietnam War. One was, how well was the
                        process of Vietnamization working? Secondly, there was the matter of
                        understanding what was really going on in the Politburo in Hanoi.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0217" n="Page0217"/>
                <p>Regarding Vietnamization, it was pretty well accepted that one of the problems
                    that appeared later was that we were training the South Vietnamese Army to be an
                    American type army, with a tremendous, supply tail and which was road bound and
                    all of that. Were you getting good reports on how well the South Vietnamese
                    Army, or ARVN, was developing, as opposed to the North Vietnamese?</p>
                <p>LORD: Okay, let me make some general comments on this. Then, when we discuss it
                    chronologically and get into more detail about negotiations and so forth, we can
                    consider other aspects.</p>
                <p>Depending on one's point of view, one could say that the strategy outlined worked
                    fairly well, although it took a relatively longer time to implement than
                    envisioned. It maintained a sufficient level of support in the public opinion
                    polls and enough domestic support in the U.S. that we were able to maintain our
                    involvement in South Vietnam while we were negotiating in Paris. American
                    casualties and involvement were reduced successfully, from a high of 585,000
                    troops, which we inherited from our predecessors, over the next couple of years.
                    We were successful in buying time for the rest of Southeast Asia to avoid
                    becoming dominos and to become tigers instead. We finally managed to negotiate a
                    settlement in early 1973 which protected U.S. credibility and gave South Vietnam
                    a chance.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, you can certainly take the point of view that this strategy
                    did not work and that it led to several more years of war. I don't know how many
                    more casualties were involved. I think there were perhaps 20,000 more Americans
                    killed, out of a total of some 50,000 killed, although I do not recall the exact
                    figure. We ended up with an agreement with the North Vietnamese which, although
                    better than most thought possible, basically didn't hold up. Within a couple of
                    years the Saigon Government had disappeared, whether it is your point of view
                    that this was due to Hanoi's perfidy, the weakness of the South Vietnamese,
                    dastardly actions by the U.S. Congress, or the impact of the Watergate Affair.
                    Or all of the above. Take your pick. For whatever reason, after four more years
                    of the expenditure of treasure and debates within American society, as well as
                    the loss of American and South Vietnamese lives, we achieved an agreement that
                    only held up for a couple of years. On the other hand, it was not a sellout and
                    we bought valuable time for all of our friends in Southeast Asia who went on to
                    become tigers instead of dominos.</p>
                <p>The question is whether we would have been better off accepting one of two
                    extremes from the beginning. One of these extremes is that we should have cut
                    our losses and unilaterally withdrawn from South Vietnam in 1969. The more
                    hawkish extreme which some people, in retrospect, believe, is that we should
                    have gone all out in military terms to support our troops. Rather than either
                    extreme, we in fact muddled through, with all of the losses involved. The tough
                    choices avoided were a very determined military effort on the one hand, and the
                    most dovish pullout on the other. This is basically the view of a very good book
                    written by Les Gelb and Richard Betts.</p>
                <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                <p>Presidents Johnson and Nixon always seemed to follow a medium course. They were
                    not really brutal enough to sock it to Hanoi enough and get them to be more
                    reasonable at the negotiating table. They weren't dovish enough to pull out and
                    cut our losses. They always felt that an additional, moderate increment of
                    American troops - here I'm talking about the administration of President Johnson
                    - would do the job. Or some additional bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, or work in
                    Cambodia and Laos, in the case of President Nixon, might be decisive militarily.
                    So there are different views. However, to the extent that our efforts didn't
                    produce a lasting settlement, there were a couple of miscalculations made, in
                    retrospect. First, there was the view that the South Vietnamese would be able to
                    take on the bulk of the fighting. In fairness to the South Vietnamese, the
                    successive cut off's of American aid and the removal of the threat of bombing,
                    after early 1973, when the peace agreement was reached, encouraged Hanoi and
                    severely undercut South Vietnamese morale. It was pretty tough for the South
                    Vietnamese to take on the North Vietnamese when they were getting only limited
                    support from the American Congress. I think that Congress is guilty in that
                    respect. Nevertheless, corruption and other shortcomings on the part of the
                    South Vietnamese were also clear. One could make the case that the South
                    Vietnamese were not capable of taking on the North Vietnamese on their own, even
                    with American support. This was an element in the South Vietnamese collapse.</p>
                <p>So one miscalculation might have concerned how able South Vietnam was to handle
                    this struggle, largely on its own. Another misjudgment might have concerned the
                    willingness of Hanoi to negotiate seriously. The North Vietnamese were
                    revolutionaries who didn't like to negotiate and compromise. They wanted to win
                    everything. They were very tough about negotiating in secret and, of course, in
                    public. This was partly because it's not their custom to compromise and they
                    play for the long run. This was partly because Hanoi probably felt that the
                    South Vietnamese were fairly weak on their own and that Hanoi could take them on
                    and take them over at some point. Partly also because Hanoi may have concluded
                    that American domestic support for the war was fading fast. Although there was a
                    solid public majority supporting our efforts in Vietnam, there is no question
                    that in Congress and in the media support for our involvement was souring fast.
                    Hanoi may have concluded that it could wait until the American administration no
                    longer had enough support for our involvement in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>So these were the elements that didn't work. You can judge the record in terms of
                    what occurred and the impact of Congress and the Watergate Affair. Or you could
                    say that President Nixon and Kissinger caused the loss of a lot more American
                    and Vietnamese lives and greater casualties than were necessary and that there
                    was an inherent contradiction in our policies. You could say that we should have
                    withdrawn much sooner than we did.</p>
                <pb facs="0219" n="Page0219"/>
                <p>But on this latter point, there is one other retrospective theory that I want to
                    shoot down. I'll make this clear as we go through the chronology. That is, the
                    proposition that the deal we made with the North Vietnamese in 1973, negotiated
                    at the end of 1972, could have been achieved much earlier through a unilateral,
                    U.S. withdrawal, and not what we negotiated, which involved withdrawal of
                    American forces, a cease-fire, return of prisoners, and international
                    supervision of the agreement reached. There are some revisionists who claim
                    that, if we had just offered a unilateral withdrawal at some time in the period
                    from 1969 to 1971, we could have had an end to the war at that time.</p>
                <p>This view is absolutely wrong, and I will show why it is. In fact, beginning on
                    May 31, 1971, we offered such an arrangement in the secret talks. The basic
                    problem was that Hanoi's stipulation for an agreement to end the war was that
                    there would have to be a military and a political settlement at the same time.
                    Nixon and Kissinger said, and I agreed with them on this, that we would only
                    agree to a military settlement. The political future of Vietnam would have to be
                    worked out by the Vietnamese themselves. More concretely, Hanoi's position was
                    that the U.S. should get out of Vietnam unilaterally. However, as we left, we
                    would have to overthrow the South Vietnamese Government under President Thieu
                    and help to install a coalition government in South Vietnam. Then we would get
                    our prisoners back. That was their consistent position in the negotiations until
                    October 1972.</p>
                <p>Almost from the beginning of the negotiations [in 1969] the American position was
                    that we were willing to resolve the military portion of this agreement. This was
                    foreshadowed very concretely in a Presidential speech in November 1969, and
                    particularly in May 1971, when we secretly indicated that we were willing not to
                    insist on a North Vietnamese withdrawal. We said that we would withdraw from
                    South Vietnam, there would be a cease-fire throughout Indochina, we would get
                    our prisoners back, and we would insist on international supervision of the
                    agreement. We would continue aid to South Vietnam so that they could take on the
                    North Vietnamese by themselves if the cease-fire broke down. What we declined to
                    do was that, as we withdrew, we would overthrow the current government in Saigon
                    and form a coalition government, as Hanoi demanded. It would be one thing for us
                    to withdraw our forces and then support South Vietnam to carry the fight itself,
                    if necessary. Hopefully, given the cease-fire, this would be a political
                    struggle. However, we would not overturn an ally as we left, both because this
                    would be immoral and because we had enough leverage so that we did not have to
                    do that and because we would undermine our credibility around the world about
                    how we treat our friends, and we would have made a mockery of all the sacrifices
                    to date.</p>
                <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                <p>That was the basic dilemma underlying most of the secret negotiations throughout
                    the period from 1970-1972. It was not until the fall of 1972 that Hanoi realized
                    that President Nixon was going to be reelected and that it wasn't going to be
                    dealing with Senator McGovern [the Democratic candidate for President in the
                    elections of 1972, who was totally disposed toward Hanoi's conditions]. Hanoi
                    realized that it was going to have to deal with Nixon, a mad man in the White
                    House who would not have to worry about being reelected. Therefore, Hanoi had an
                    incentive for negotiating seriously, and in October 1972, they finally dropped
                    their political demands and were prepared to settle for an agreement that they
                    could have had a couple of years earlier.</p>
                <p>So it would be absolutely wrong to say that what we finally got was something
                    that we could have had earlier. I think that it is useful to make these general
                    observations before going into further detail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose that we could move into greater detail. I always
                        try tkeep the focus on what you were seeing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's right. I want to set out the conceptual framework in which things
                    happened, as I saw them. As you will see, I had some disagreements along the way
                    on tactics and specific actions. I had a very strong opinion on the Cambodian
                    incursion [in spring - 1970]. I will get to that. However, I was very
                    comfortable with our basic strategy of not overthrowing the South Vietnamese
                    Government and not acceding to the political demands made by Hanoi, while
                    reducing American involvement in South Vietnam through the process of
                    Vietnamization, plus serious negotiations. I felt that this was an honorable
                    path to follow. It matched up with my now somewhat more dovish outlook.</p>
                <p>Q: As you're doing this, I hope that you will keep in mind something that we were
                    talking about while the microphone was turned off. That is, the atmosphere
                    within the NSC [National Security Council]. How much were the discussions within
                    the NSC an internal discussion by people who basically were thinking that the
                    North Vietnamese Politburo will do this, and the South Vietnamese should do
                    that. We're talking about people who were sitting in the White House, trying to
                    figure out what foreigners are going to do and how they're going to react.</p>
                <pb facs="0221" n="Page0221"/>
                <p>LORD: Well, of course, we had the whole apparatus of the American intelligence
                    community, the State Department, our embassy in South Vietnam, and so on
                    reporting on attitudes in Saigon and Hanoi. So it wasn't just the NSC staff
                    which miscalculated what was going on, even though the State Department wasn't
                    involved in the secret negotiations with the North Vietnamese. I think that it's
                    fair to say that there was general support within the administration for the
                    policy line which I have outlined and which was followed by Secretary of State
                    Rogers, by Secretary of Defense Laird, and by the other key figures. This was
                    not a case like the one we had in the previous administration with Deputy
                    Secretary of State George Ball clearly contesting the policy advocated by
                    Secretary of State Rusk. Sometimes Laird (and Rogers) was more eager than the
                    White House to speed up Vietnamization and the pace of our withdrawals. But
                    there was a general consensus on the policy approach to be taken. I don't think
                    that there was any real debate on this. I've already indicated the range of
                    views within the NSC staff itself.</p>
                <p>Now, the first thing that President Nixon and Kissinger did on Vietnam after
                    entering office [in 1969] was to have the government undertake a total review of
                    our Vietnam policy. I think that the very first National Security Study
                    Memorandum, or NSSM, that was issued was to inaugurate a very extensive,
                    interagency study on Vietnam. This included how we were doing militarily, what
                    the South Vietnamese economic, military, and diplomatic situation was, and the
                    various options that might be considered in terms of policy. This was a genuine
                    attempt by Nixon and Kissinger to gather information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this one of these studies intended to tie the
                        government uwhile the administration did what it wanted to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I'm going to give you a mixed response to that question. This was a genuine
                    attempt to get information. Contributions to the response were made by CIA, DIA,
                    the Joint Chiefs of Staff, our people on the ground, the State Department, and
                    others. In other words, all of the relevant actors in Washington and overseas.
                    Those contributions were assembled to make up the response.</p>
                <pb facs="0222" n="Page0222"/>
                <p>Secondly, this was one of a series of National Security Study Memoranda. They
                    were designed to do what was done on other issues, like the Middle East, Europe,
                    and elsewhere. It is also true that contributing to these memoranda would keep
                    the bureaucracy busy. But there was a real search for data and ideas. Some of
                    the operational responsibilities on key issues would be taken by the secret
                    negotiations through the NSC and Kissinger. However, in all fairness, in the
                    very first months of the Nixon administration when these NSSMS were issued,
                    there were no secret talks with the Chinese Communists and with the Vietnamese
                    Communists.I am sure that in the case of Vietnam secret negotiation was an issue
                    for very early consideration, although I was not in the front office and was not
                    involved in trying to arrange secret contacts with the Vietnamese Communists.
                    So-called negotiations - in reality propaganda exchanges - were already taking
                    place publicly in Paris, under arrangements made by the previous administration.
                    There was a general feeling that we had to get more information. Also, there was
                    a feeling that we needed more ideas. I do not want to be cynical here. Nixon and
                    Kissinger probably had a rough outline in their minds as to what they wanted to
                    do, but they wanted to get other people's views and additional information. They
                    also wanted to get other people's support for whatever strategy they
                    pursued.</p>
                <p>Participating in making this study were not only all of the other agencies I
                    mentioned previously, but also outside consultants, including a man named Daniel
                    Ellsberg, who later leaked the Pentagon Papers. Of course, he was very dovish,
                    even at that point. He had been one of the most extreme hawks. Other people were
                    consulted on this matter. I was involved as a part of the planning staff in the
                    Executive Office Building. And then I collated and summarized the agency
                    responses for Kissinger.</p>
                <p>I don't recall the precise sequencing of memoranda, decisions made, and
                    deadlines. I think that it's fair to say that this was a very good, solid,
                    intellectual process. It was genuine and not just a cynical cover exercise. It
                    helped to shape the views and decisions of President Nixon and Kissinger. It
                    helped to construct and gain support for the two-track strategy that I
                    mentioned. Namely, Vietnamization, or turning over additional responsibility to
                    South Vietnam, and serious negotiations with Hanoi at the same time.</p>
                <p>Everything was looked at, whether it was pacification efforts, military efforts,
                    or the diplomatic situation. Negotiations were then taking place publicly in
                    Paris. Hanoi's strengths and the positions of allies were looked at very
                    exhaustively. I think that this effort was well done.In any event, out of this
                    emerged pretty much of a consensus on pursuing Vietnamization and negotiating an
                    end to the conflict. To be sure, the State Department was kept out of the secret
                    negotiations. In retrospect, it is quite astounding that the State Department
                    was also kept out of a lot of the secret exchanges with the Chinese, in addition
                    to a lot of the negotiations conducted by Kissinger with the Russians. But we've
                    been through that already. In addition to secret meetings we used extensively
                    backchannel telegrams through the White House Situation Room.</p>
                <pb facs="0223" n="Page0223"/>
                <p>As I've said, during this period there were two roles that the Planning Staff of
                    Mort Halperin and myself, sitting over in the Executive Office Building, had to
                    perform. One was to help to run the NSC system and to prepare agenda papers for
                    NSC sub-groups and the NSC itself on various subjects. In that respect I helped
                    Halperin put together the various papers, including those on Vietnam, which set
                    out our options and so on.</p>
                <p>The other role was to write think pieces for Kissinger on various subjects, in
                    which I sometimes acted as devil's advocate in challenging some aspects of
                    foreign policy. On other occasions it involved just looking ahead, noting that
                    there was a problem coming up which we had to get on top of. During this period
                    I sometimes helped Mort Halperin write these memoranda, although he would often
                    write them on his own as well. Sometimes, I would write memos of my own. I wrote
                    a series of memoranda, sometimes on my own and sometimes helping Halperin, to
                    Kissinger on various subjects. At least a couple of them were on the Indochina
                    situation.</p>
                <p>I recall specifically a memorandum from me (through Halperin) on Laos in which I
                    questioned aspects of our involvement in that country. I led off by quoting
                    Kissinger himself, in which he said that sometimes it is more important to ask
                    the right questions than to have all of the right answers. So my memo on Laos
                    did not necessarily say that we ought to change our policy. In effect, it raised
                    a series of questions as to whether this policy was working or whether there
                    were some real problems with it. It was a definitely dovish memorandum, although
                    I don't remember the details.</p>
                <p>On Vietnam I believe that any memorandum went forward under Halperin's name,
                    although I often helped him with memos of this kind. Again, without
                    fundamentally challenging the policy on Vietnamization and negotiations, I might
                    well have weighed in on the dovish side or the more skeptical side on what we
                    were doing or how serious we should be about negotiations. What I am pointing
                    out is that, without being uncomfortable with our overall approach, I would
                    question the tactical side, at least in the case of a couple of memoranda to
                    Kissinger. He would either see what I had done or knew what I had done with
                    Halperin.</p>
                <p>So I made my views known to Kissinger. This shows that he did not want a yes man
                    and did not react violently to my views, saying, in effect: “How dare you
                    challenge our policies?” He took just the opposite view. Indeed, this was
                    important also, because this is what brought me to his attention. He saw me
                    working with Halperin in NSC meetings, in the NSC system in general, and on
                    specific papers. I think that he was impressed by the arguments that I made in
                    some of these papers. They were not just on Indochina. There were other papers,
                    on African policy and so on. Kissinger welcomed, indeed sought, disagreement so
                    long as it was well argued.</p>
                <pb facs="0224" n="Page0224"/>
                <p>Without my being immodest, I guess that these papers showed that there was a
                    pretty good mind at work, not to mention some courage. Even if Kissinger was not
                    always persuaded by the arguments, he at least thought that they were well
                    presented. I think that it's fair to say that by participating in drafting these
                    memoranda I derived a more general exposure to Kissinger and the NSC system.
                    These memoranda brought me to his attention, so that when Tony Lake decided to
                    leave the NSC staff, where he had been Special Assistant to Kissinger, I was
                    asked to take Tony's place.</p>
                <p>Q: When did Lake leave the NSC staff?</p>
                <p>LORD: He was already planning to leave. Early in 1970 he made a decision to
                    leave, and that was when Kissinger asked me to take the place of Tony Lake. When
                    Lake made the decision to leave, and I don't remember the exact time, it was not
                    on substantive grounds, although you'd have to talk to Tony Lake on this. I
                    don't want to mix this up, but it was essentially a matter of the hours of work,
                    pressures, and the imposition on family time. Tony Lake was dovish in outlook,
                    but he was not by any means fundamentally ready to leave the NSC in a kind of
                    protest. Indeed, as evidence of this, he told Kissinger well in advance that he
                    wanted to leave the NSC staff. Kissinger put me in the position of his Special
                    Assistant, but Lake stayed on a few more months, more in a policy planning role,
                    and not as operational as we were. He and Morris were just sitting off to the
                    side, drafting memoranda.</p>
                <p>But Lake's ostensible reason for leaving Kissinger's staff, and I think that this
                    was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back, was the Cambodian invasion
                    in spring, 1970. Lake left the position of Special Assistant and was sitting
                    there in Kissinger's suite of offices from February to May, 1970. Lake was
                    planning to leave in the summer of 1970, anyway. So, in retrospect, Kissinger
                    was always somewhat cynical in saying that when Lake and Morris left his staff
                    shortly after the Cambodian incursion, (it was called an “incursion” and not an
                    “invasion”) they were leaving Kissinger's staff anyway and were just
                    grandstanding on the way out. They were going to leave anyway, for other
                    reasons. Lake or Morris would say that, up until then, although they were
                    getting increasingly uncomfortable with our Vietnam policy, they weren't ready
                    to make an issue of it when they left. They were leaving Kissinger's staff for
                    other reasons, but they felt that the Cambodian incursion was so outrageous that
                    they not only wanted to leave right away but wanted to leave on a matter of
                    principle.</p>
                <p>So it is a fact that Lake, and I'm quite sure that the same consideration applied
                    to Morris, had already decided to leave before the Cambodian incursion
                    occurred.</p>
                <p>I was still in the Executive Office Building in 1969. Another aspect of my
                    involvement in Vietnam affairs at that time was my helping Halperin to prepare
                    Presidential statements and/or speeches. I remember particularly working on the
                    President's November, 1969, speech on Vietnam. I can't recall the first speech
                    when President Nixon first announced the Vietnamization policy. It might have
                    been that speech or it might have been on another occasion.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't Guam involved in that speech?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I believe the Guam, or Nixon Doctrine, statement wasn't really a speech. It
                    talked about our allies in Asia being on the front lines and America
                    increasingly in a supporting role - clearly akin to Vietnamization. But it
                    didn't mention Vietnamization specifically. What was significant about the
                    November, 1969, speech is that it had some tough Pat Buchanan-like rhetoric in
                    it, but it also called for a cease-fire in place. Now, maybe this was too subtle
                    for many Americans and even for Hanoi. However, a cease-fire in place
                    represented an evolution in our position. Up till then we'd always insisted on
                    mutual withdrawals as part of any cease-fire. In effect, when you say, “Let's
                    have a 'cease-fire in place,'” that, by definition, meant that North Vietnamese
                    troops in South Vietnam would remain in place. This would have been only for a
                    temporary period of time. We were still not saying that there would be a
                    unilateral withdrawal. However, we were basically saying that we could have a
                    cease-fire even if North Vietnamese troops stayed in South Vietnam. So that was
                    a more forthcoming and flexible element of that speech which is generally
                    overlooked when people focus on some of the tough rhetoric against Hanoi, which
                    was also in the speech. If that was not the first time that the principle of
                    Vietnamization was announced, it may have been one of the first announcements of
                    American troops actually leaving Vietnam. I just don't recall the sequence of
                    these announcements.</p>
                <p>You mentioned Guam. President Nixon was in Guam at some point in thsummer of
                    1969. I think that it was part of a trip through East Asia...</p>
                <p>Q: I think that he was going to the Philippines in connection with a SEATO
                    [Southeast Asia Treaty Organization] meeting, or something like that.</p>
                <p>LORD: We had allies helping us in Vietnam, like Australia, the Philippines, South
                    Korea, and Thailand. Nixon's press conference in Guam was not a scripted,
                    carefully prepared statement of U.S. policy. President Nixon made some comments
                    on East Asia. I assume that he had thought about them in advance. However, as I
                    recall it, this was not a prepared text. President Nixon made some statements
                    which the press immediately gave some weight to and called it the Guam Doctrine.
                    This was probably more than Nixon intended at first. This then evolved into the
                    Nixon Doctrine, which essentially said first that the U.S. would remain a world
                    power and an Asian power. Nixon may have said that it would remain a global
                    power. He said, in effect, that we would maintaina nuclear umbrella for our
                    allies.</p>
                <pb facs="0226" n="Page0226"/>
                <p>Second, however, in a conventional conflict, (such as in the case of Vietnam) we
                    would expect that the major burden of the conflict would be borne by the
                    countries involved themselves. Third, we would provide military and economic
                    assistance so that our friends could do this. So there were the ideas that we
                    would maintain a nuclear umbrella, that the conventional fighting would be done
                    essentially by our friends, and that we would help them with aid.</p>
                <p>This attracted quite a bit of attention. Then, Kissinger, and others of us said:
                    Let's build this concept into a more articulated strategy generally for our
                    foreign policy. So we worked hard on this. I spent a great deal of time helping
                    to elaborate the Nixon Doctrine. For example, I think that I have mentioned that
                    in February of every year we would put out a Presidential statement on foreign
                    policy. We began there and in speeches to turn the Guam statement into the Nixon
                    Doctrine. On the one hand we said that we were going to be a reliable ally and
                    that we would be in the Pacific area to do what we should do. However, we added
                    that our friends had to pick up more of the burden, mostly because it was their
                    conflict, after all. For the sake of American interests we had to maintain a
                    world role and we had to help our friends with assistance. By sharing burdens we
                    would reflect a more multipolar world after two decades of almost unilateral
                    American exertion. And we would maintain American domestic support by showing
                    our friends were doing more.</p>
                <p>So we developed this new approach to security responsibilities around the world,
                    with particular reference to Indochina and Vietnam. That was conceptually some
                    background music for the Vietnamization approach.</p>
                <p>Q: I keep returning to this theme but I think that it's important. You had
                    General Alexander Haig on the NSC. Vietnamization of the conflict in Vietnam was
                    one of the twin pillars. Perhaps I should point out that I was in Vietnam during
                    part of this time, as Consul General in Saigon, from February, 1969, until June,
                    1970. You know, if the American military are told that they have to accomplish
                    something, they'll try their damnedest to do it. However, they'll also report
                    that it has been done, whether it's really done or not.</p>
                <p>Then there was Congress sending people out to Vietnam, particularly members and
                    staff from the Committee on Foreign Relations, Lowenstein and Dick Moose, to go
                    out there and sniff around. I would think that, if you're on the NSC staff, you
                    would want somebody to go out to Vietnam and really look at Vietnamization and
                    not simply rely on the reports coming in through regular channels. Did you have
                    something like that?</p>
                <pb facs="0227" n="Page0227"/>
                <p>LORD: Of course we did. I don't recall the names of all of the various people who
                    went out to Vietnam for this purpose. Al Haig went out to hold South Vietnamese
                    President Nguyen Van Thieu's hand, and so on. People from the NSC staff who went
                    out to Vietnam included Larry Lynn, who was taking a hard look at how
                    Vietnamization was doing. I'm sure that Lynn went out there. Halperin didn't,
                    and I didn't go to Vietnam. I don't recall whether Dick Smyser went out to
                    Vietnam, during this early period. Other visitors, including Congressmen, would
                    report their impressions as well.</p>
                <p>Someone like Kissinger would grab anybody that he could for their perspective.
                    This included Daniel Ellsberg during the early period, former military officials
                    who had visited there, or Congressmen who had been out there. He would try to
                    get their views, as well as the official views on how Vietnamization was faring.
                    So an effort was made to learn how Vietnamization was doing. Some of the people
                    brought in included John Paul Vann, who was consulted, although I forget the
                    dates. People like that. So there was a real effort to find out what was
                    happening in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Within the U.S. Government, although they'd have to speak for themselves, some
                    people were more optimistic about the Vietnamese ability to take over
                    responsibility for the war than others were. I don't recall the American
                    military objecting to this. They wanted to get American involvement and
                    casualties down as much as anyone else. They also wanted to win the war.</p>
                <p>The most vigorous proponent of Vietnamization was Secretary of Defense Mel Laird.
                    Indeed, I hate to draw distinctions between dovish and hawkish, but Secretary
                    Laird was very concerned about domestic support for the war. Of course, he had
                    been a member of the House of Representatives. He really put a lot of emphasis
                    on Vietnamization. As I recall, there were times when Secretary Laird wanted to
                    withdraw more troops in the next increment of U.S. withdrawals under the
                    Vietnamization program than President Nixon and Kissinger did. I don't want to
                    exaggerate this, but Laird was a very strong proponent of Vietnamization. I
                    don't recall General Westmoreland, the members of the JCS [Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff], or other people being as vigorous as Secretary Laird. My guess is that
                    maybe they were more cautious about how fast the South Vietnamese could take
                    over more of the responsibility. Secretary Laird pushed the American military to
                    speed up the Vietnamization process, to a certain extent. At least, this is my
                    general recollection.</p>
                <p>Secretary of State Rogers, who seemed somewhat more dovish, was probably also in
                    favor of moving along the process of Vietnamization more quickly than President
                    Nixon and Kissinger. The latter two, while recognizing the need to advance
                    Vietnamization to lower casualties and maintain domestic support for the war,
                    also wanted to make sure that the traffic would bear it and that the South
                    Vietnamese would take on more responsibility effectively.</p>
                <pb facs="0228" n="Page0228"/>
                <p>You asked me for my perceptions on how well the Vietnamization program was going
                    and how well the Vietnamese Army was doing in taking over responsibility for the
                    fighting. I guess that I felt confident, on the whole, that we were moving at
                    about the right pace. I would read the reports, whether they were internal
                    reports by people like Larry Lynn and others, or Pentagon or CIA [Central
                    Intelligence Agency] and DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency] reports.</p>
                <p>I was, of course, super careful about optimistic reports about how we were doing,
                    after my disillusionment with the Tet experience [in 1968]. This was partly out
                    of conviction and partly because I saw the need to maintain credibility and
                    domestic support for our Vietnam policy. Finally, I wanted to see a reduction in
                    American casualties. I certainly hoped that we were proceeding with
                    Vietnamization at the right pace. There may have been an element of wishful
                    thinking as well as cold, hard analysis. However, my instinct was that we were
                    moving at about the right speed. The South Vietnamese had to take on more
                    responsibility, and the increments that we were announcing did not seem
                    unreasonable.</p>
                <p>I certainly was never uncomfortable with the pace of Vietnamization. I certainly
                    never raised the issue that we can't do this or that we are going too fast. This
                    was partly out of conviction on my part but, perhaps, in retrospect, this also
                    involved some wishful thinking on the part of all of us. I felt that the pace of
                    Vietnamization was about right. The military situation in Vietnam certainly did
                    not deteriorate during this period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the 18 months that I was in Vietnam, which was
                        during justhis period, things looked pretty good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, that was true. At worst, we were probably holding our own but, in
                    fact, we were also probably making some gains. Meantime, once we announced the
                    Vietnamization program, American domestic support for the war solidified. Most
                    Americans believed that they could see the end of the tunnel, however murky the
                    time and distance were. Therefore, I was comfortable with what we were
                    doing.</p>
                <p>Now, on the specific issue of whether we were training the South Vietnamese to
                    fight a more conventional war as opposed to what was needed, I don't recall
                    fundamentally disagreeing at the time with the strategy being pursued. Others
                    who have given this matter more thought would have to comment on it. I certainly
                    didn't feel that we were doing everything wrong. I don't know whether the
                    conventional wisdom is totally accurate, whether in fact we were training the
                    South Vietnamese to fight World War II type tank battles. I'm not sure that is a
                    fair assessment of what we were doing. Certainly there were other elements, like
                    the heavy use of helicopters, pacification, etc.</p>
                <p>Q: It ended up basically with fighting that kind of struggle, when the North
                    Vietnamese finally made a massive commitment to the campaign in the South.</p>
                <pb facs="0229" n="Page0229"/>
                <p>LORD: The struggle turned out to be more conventional than a domestic conflict,
                    when the North Vietnamese could blatantly cross the DMZ [Demilitarized Zone at
                    the 17th Parallel].</p>
                <p>You have to remember that we had other pacification programs going on, including
                    ideological programs to win over the people's hearts and minds. So it wasn't
                    just a strict World War II or Korean approach. That would be an unfair
                    characterization</p>
                <p>Q: What about the real home front for you and what you gathered from your
                    colleagues? Here you came out of the intellectual community and all of that.
                    I've heard people say: “Here they're working away on the war, and their kids
                    were out protesting outside the building.” Was this having much effect?</p>
                <p>LORD: Absolutely. I was debating whether to mention this next ocome to it later.
                    Let me discuss that now.</p>
                <p>This was a very emotionally trying period for me personally. Beside some of the
                    reasons you mentioned, almost without exception, most of my good friends outside
                    the government felt that we should get out of Vietnam quicker rather than later
                    for hard-headed reasons. They wouldn't have been good friends of mine if they
                    felt that the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese were outright heroes and we were
                    all somehow depraved. Most of my friends were of the responsible dovish variety.
                    Their views were essentially those of the “Washington Post” and the “New York
                    Times.” Namely, they weren't in favor of totally capitulating to the communists.
                    They recognized that the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese were bad. However,
                    they felt that there were some real problems with the South Vietnamese
                    Government. And in terms of the American involvement in Vietnam, they felt that
                    we ought to get out of Vietnam sooner rather than later. They were not so much
                    in favor of total capitulation as for a much more forthcoming posture toward the
                    communists, so as to cut our losse- both casualties abroad and the social impact
                    in America.</p>
                <p>So it's fair to say that most friends and acquaintances of mine were fairly
                    dovish. Very few, however, would ever accuse me of being immoral or wrong by
                    working for the Administration. At least, this was the case with people that I
                    knew and so forth. They understood that I could work for the government in good
                    conscience and they wouldn't say to me: “Why don't you leave your job
                    immediately?” They were more sophisticated than that.</p>
                <pb facs="0230" n="Page0230"/>
                <p>I might add that my working hours were so extreme - about 80 hours a week - that
                    I didn't see many people outside the office! Beyond that, of course, was the
                    general, emotional context of demonstrations outside the White House, which made
                    people more and more upset. And we have to record that the 1960s were a very
                    difficult decade anyway. We had seen President Kennedy assassinated [in 1963].
                    We had the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King [in 1963].
                    There were race riots and the general angst of the 1960s, all of which was taken
                    up most violently, of course, in the Vietnam debate.</p>
                <p>All of this was emotionally wrenching for me. On the one hand I basically
                    supported what the Administration was doing. However, I was somewhat more
                    dovish, at least on tactical grounds. A further dimension of this angst, arose
                    when I became a Special Assistant to Kissinger, and became involved at the
                    center. Then I knew that our secret negotiating positions were much more
                    reasonable than the American Congress, public, and media knew. And that Hanoi
                    was absolutely unyielding.</p>
                <p>I knew, for example, that we were making negotiating proposals to the communists
                    that were as dovish or flexible, using a more appropriate adjective, as the “New
                    York Times” or the “Washington Post.” These proposals were essentially to have a
                    cease-fire and get out of Vietnam and get our prisoners back, leaving it to the
                    Vietnamese to handle the war on their own. I'm not talking about the extreme,
                    Jane Fonda or Daniel Ellsberg positions. I'm talking about the mainstream “New
                    York Times” and “Washington Post” positions. In effect, we were doing as much,
                    and sometimes more, than what they were calling for in their editorials.
                    However, we were doing this secretly, because you couldn't negotiate this in
                    public, and thus we received no credit for our efforts.</p>
                <p>In fact, Hanoi was rejecting terms which the “Washington Post” and the “New York
                    Times” thought would end the war and which, they thought, we should be
                    proposing. In addition to my general feelings of angst, I was sworn to secrecy
                    on the negotiations and on our positions. I had to put up with attacks on the
                    administration and on me personally at cocktail parties and so on. Not that I
                    went to so many cocktail parties! I knew and I couldn't say that in fact we were
                    doing what the more reasonable doves were suggesting. This added a dimension to
                    the problem which made it even more painful - in effect, if they only knew how
                    reasonable we were and how intransigent Hanoi was, they would have been somewhat
                    more sympathetic to the administration and, frankly, to me.</p>
                <p>There were also examples where Hanoi would appear to be reasonable in the public
                    negotiations in Paris - they would put forward a six-point plan or a nine-point
                    plan. I forget how many points their plans had. But in private they wouldn't
                    stick by these plans but would be much tougher. So they were playing the old
                    game of appealing to American public opinion through contacts with Jane Fonda
                    and American Congressmen visiting Hanoi. They generally were putting out the
                    line that they were being reasonable. However, their real position in the secret
                    negotiations was much tougher.</p>
                <pb facs="0231" n="Page0231"/>
                <p>So this double level of public awareness versus private reality made it even more
                    painful for all of us during this period. This made it a very tough and complex
                    period for us. On the one hand, it was exhilarating to work in the White House
                    to try to help end the war on an honorable basis, to be caught up in the secret
                    negotiations and the excitement of them, and also to work on other issues, like
                    China and Russia. But on the other hand there was also the emotional context -
                    not to mention the continuing loss of life in Indochina.X. NSC - INDOCHINA

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm interrupting you while you're describing the
                        atmospherics othe negotiations. Would you move on to the chronology of
                        events?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Sure. I think that the next step was when I became a Special Assistant.
                    I've talked about my involvement in the policy planning process and my
                    preparation of memos. I helped to draft speeches for the President and his
                    public reports, as well as statements on Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Right after I became a Special Assistant in February, 1970, came one of the most
                    painful experiences in my entire career. If I had to list four or five of the
                    worst moments of my career, one would be the Bush banquet and Fang Liz-hi in
                    February 1989. Another such moment will come later, in October, 1972, when South
                    Vietnamese President Nguyen van Thieu rejected a draft agreement with North
                    Vietnam which had been worked out.</p>
                <p>However, another one of the worst experiences of my entire career was in
                    March-April, 1970, regarding Laos. The first, major assignment that Kissinger
                    handed me, when I became his Special Assistant, was to participate in and
                    supervise the drafting of a major White Paper on our involvement in Laos. Some
                    questions had been raised in Congress and in the media about whether we had been
                    more heavily involved militarily in Laos than we had publicly admitted. Other
                    questions concerned whether we had combat forces in Laos, what was the CIA
                    [Central Intelligence Agency] doing, had there been American casualties which we
                    had covered up, and what had we been doing in Laos in recent years.</p>
                <p>The purpose of this White Paper was actually elevated, meant to be forthcoming.
                    In other words, it was to come clean on our total involvement in Laos, keeping
                    in mind that this was what the previous administration under President Johnson
                    had done, not Nixon. In fact, we sought to dispel exaggerated rumors about
                    secret American involvement.I was in charge of pulling together the facts from
                    the various agencies and drafting a statement which the White House would put
                    out under President Nixon's imprimatur. I forget which agencies were involved,
                    but they certainly included the State Department, the Pentagon, CIA, DIA and
                    other military agencies, our Embassies, and every conceivable source. So I
                    assembled this material and wrote the report, although I had help from
                    others.</p>
                <pb facs="0232" n="Page0232"/>
                <p>I did this under pressure. This was my first, big job under Kissinger as his
                    Special Assistant. It was obviously important in view of the involvement of
                    President Nixon and our public position. I distinctly remember a feeling of
                    great accomplishment in producing what I considered a fair report which
                    explained the dilemmas and the policies underlying U.S. involvement in Laos. It
                    was factually constructive. It made clear that there were no ominous revelations
                    to be had. I felt: “Boy, I really pulled this off!” It was my first big
                    challenge and it was a major and tricky one. Kissinger was very happy with it.
                    The White House was also happy.</p>
                <p>I distinctly remember going to bed on a Saturday night, I think that it was March
                    5 or 6, 1970, feeling a sense of personal accomplishment for the nation and for
                    President Nixon and Kissinger.</p>
                <p>At about 5:00 or 6:00 AM on Sunday I received a phone call from Al Haig. He asked
                    if I had seen the “Washington Post.” I hadn't. I don't believe Haig told me the
                    issue; he just said, “Go get a copy” - rather cruel in retrospect. So Bette and
                    I went to the drugstore with great trepidation to get an early edition.</p>
                <p>It was a devastating shock.</p>
                <p>In this issue of the “Post,” there were blazing headlines which, in effect, said
                    that American soldiers had been killed in combat in Laos. The article said that
                    the White House “White Paper,” in effect, had lied to the American people. We
                    had a sentence in the report, as published, which said: “No American has ever
                    been killed in combat in Laos.” It turned out that there was one incident in
                    which some American troops who, I suppose, were training the Lao, were
                    reportedly asleep in some encampment. They were attacked, I guess, by Lao
                    communists. The American soldiers hadn't gone into Laos to engage in combat.
                    That wasn't their role. In self-defense against this ambush, they fought back,
                    and a few Americans, I think that there were about a dozen, were killed.</p>
                <p>No one in the bureaucracy had ever told us about this incident. Either through
                    evasion or through narrowly construing the incident as not being combat, none of
                    the agencies contributing to this study had reported that any American personnel
                    had been killed in combat in Laos. Sounds like President Clinton narrowly
                    construing something that happened. These forces were trainers, they were
                    asleep, and they fought back when they woke up when they were attacked. So the
                    fact that they were killed in this incident does not really negate this sentence
                    in the report.</p>
                <pb facs="0233" n="Page0233"/>
                <p>However, the press had a field day over this incident, claiming that the White
                    House was covering up. The irony of this is that if I had known about this
                    incident, I would surely have included it. If the various agencies had been
                    forthcoming, this issue would not have come up as an evasion. I don't recall
                    whether it was CIA, DIA, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or some combination of these
                    agencies which was at fault. However, if we had put in the report that in the 10
                    or so years of U.S. involvement in helping Laos against the communists, only a
                    handful of Americans were killed on one occasion in this way, there would have
                    been little attention paid to it. Because the media and Congress had been
                    claiming extensive U.S. military action in Laos had been covered up. In fact,
                    these soldiers were killed because they were defending themselves. If we had
                    described this incident, given the exaggerated notions of American duplicity and
                    secrecy and combat involvement, this would have been accepted with little
                    comment. People would have said: “Boy, is that all that happened during all
                    these years? American involvement was much less than we thought.”</p>
                <p>So the idiocy and the irony of this incident is that, if the agency concerned had
                    only told us about it, we would have put it in the report and preempted the
                    controversy. This incident was the only case of Americans killed in combat, and
                    maybe they weren't even in combat, depending on how this is defined. However
                    even though this was only a handful of people killed in the course of a decade,
                    we were sharply criticized for duplicity in not reporting this incident.</p>
                <p>For the next few weeks, I, of course, felt personally responsible for not having
                    uncovered these facts, although the reality was that the error had been
                    committed in the reporting agency or agencies. Nevertheless, I had to wonder if
                    I had asked the wrong question, if I had followed up on that sentence to make
                    triply sure that the account would hold up. I had trouble sleeping after that.
                    For some time after that, when I would get up in the morning, I would vomit in
                    the bathroom because of my nervousness and my sense of something like despair
                    over what had happened. I felt some responsibility, although I had been
                    deceived. I had the sense that I hadn't followed through precisely as I should
                    have. I felt that the Administration was being unfairly attacked and tested on
                    this issue. The White House staff was grumbling about the NSC having made a mess
                    with this white paper.</p>
                <p>I must say that Kissinger handled this very well, in my view. First of all, he
                    totally and completely defended me with H. R. Haldemann [Presidential Chief of
                    Staff], Ron Ziegler [White House Press Spokesman], and everyone else on the
                    White House staff. He said that this incident was not my fault. The agencies had
                    not been sufficiently forthcoming. He said that if there is any responsibility,
                    it was his and not that of his staff. He was absolutely solid on this. It showed
                    that he could be loyal in a crunch. Of course, he could also be devious with his
                    staff, but he also treated me better than others. On this issue he went out of
                    his way to make clear that he would not downgrade me, or criticize me, not to
                    mention fire me. He was just terrific in his behavior toward me. I'm sure he
                    received many tough calls from the White House staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0234" n="Page0234"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As people reviewed this paper, was there some finger
                        pointing at particular person or somebody who didn't include this
                        incident?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No one ever got into specific trouble for it. As I recall, the agencies
                    involved said that either they had literally answered my question, or didn't
                    know about it. I don't recall the exchanges between the various agencies on this
                    matter. I distinctly remember that I was misled, but also felt that I was partly
                    responsible for this. If I had been more meticulous, I would have gone to almost
                    everybody concerned with Laos in the Pentagon and the CIA and asked them
                    specifically whether the sentence involved (re: combat) was accurate. They all
                    cleared the sentence as part of the report. I felt that I hadn't been quite as
                    careful as I should have been.</p>
                <p>However, in this fairly long report this was the only thing that was ever found
                    to be wrong or at least misleading. I thought that everything else was well
                    done, well written, and well put together. We made our case that our involvement
                    had been less extensive than many people thought. Also, this had happened under
                    the previous [Johnson] administration, so we had even less motive for a coverup.
                    I thought that the criticism of the report included a great degree of
                    unfairness.</p>
                <p>I don't recall that we pinpointed any single person who had misled me. I recall
                    that both verbally and in memos there were exchanges between Kissinger, the
                    Pentagon, and CIA on this study.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was natural enough. After all, this was their
                        bailiwick.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I didn't get into any trouble, except for my emotional trouble. I don't
                    believe that anybody in CIA or the Pentagon got into any trouble on this matter
                    either. I don't recall what their defense was. I think that they might have said
                    that we didn't check that sentence carefully enough. However, we never uncovered
                    exactly what had happened to make this mistake possible.</p>
                <p>Q: This is the kind of thing that rankles you and troubles you even today, when
                    you recount this story. However, did this incident have any effect on you and
                    your operations later on? One would think that the bureaucracy would make you
                    much more aggressive to make sure that all aspects of a report are right. Also,
                    what was the attitude of the press about this error?</p>
                <p>LORD: It certainly did not affect my relationship with Kissinger. In many ways,
                    as I said, I appreciated his loyalty. He felt that I had been unfairly treated.
                    He may have felt that I had not checked out this report carefully enough, but
                    Kissinger never said that. In terms of my responsibilities as his Special
                    Assistant, they continued to grow. I became very close to him, certainly
                    personally, as well as in terms of substance. I got more and more involved in
                    matters concerning Vietnam, not to mention Laos, Cambodia, and China.</p>
                <pb facs="0235" n="Page0235"/>
                <p>In terms of my views I thought that the press had been unfair and that they had
                    blown this error out of proportion. Give me a break. If this was all that had
                    happened, it was unfair to blow it up to this extent. In fact, this was a very
                    credible and full report, so I was resentful of the media.</p>
                <p>In my job at the NSC, in succeeding years, I didn't do many reports like this.
                    Dick Smyser and John Negroponte, as Vietnam experts, were the essential point of
                    contact with the other agencies. My job was on negotiations on the Indochina
                    countries. It was focused not so much on Vietnamization and the military aspects
                    of the struggle, but on the negotiations to end the fighting. By definition,
                    since the negotiations were secret, other people didn't know much about them
                    anyway. So I didn't have much need to rely on the bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>The only major case which I was involved in connection with the fighting
                    concerned a report on the Cambodian incursion which I prepared. I can hardly
                    believe that I did this report fairly soon after the Laos incident. It came out
                    in June 1970. So, once again, I had to rely on the bureaucracy in preparing that
                    report. I can't recall the details now, but I had to be super careful then,
                    having been burned once. There were major reactions to the Cambodian incursion,
                    but there was no major flap about alleged inaccuracies in the long report I
                    prepared. There were of course sharp disagreements on whether the incursion
                    itself was a good idea or not.</p>
                <p>So that was a painful beginning to being a Special Assistant to Kissinger. Some
                    time around then there was a leak about the secret bombing of Cambodia. I can't
                    recall the date, but a story on this matter appeared in the New York Times. It
                    was an article by Bill Beecher, who later went on to work for the Boston Globe.
                    I only mention this now, because when I worked over in the Executive Office
                    Building, I didn't know about the secret bombing of Cambodia. I can say with
                    total honesty that I never leaked anything about this or any other subject
                    throughout my tenure at the NSC. I mention this because it was that particular
                    leak, in fact, that got President Nixon, Kissinger, and Haldeman up in flames
                    about leaks in the sense that they were undermining our national security
                    policies. Therefore, this led to their instituting the phone tapping. I can talk
                    later about why this happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then let's not do it now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I don't think that we should do it now. Wait until another time. I mention
                    this now because I think that this was when telephone tapping was really going
                    on. I just can't recall the timing of it. My phone was tapped, and I'll get into
                    that later on in our discussions. I was suspicious of it because there seemed to
                    be a humming sound on my phone.</p>
                <pb facs="0236" n="Page0236"/>
                <p>Before I arrived in the West Wing as special assistant, there had been secret
                    meetings with the Vietnamese, which Tony Lake had attended, in the summer of
                    1969. The next, secret contacts took place in the spring of 1970. My first
                    secret meeting was in September 1970.</p>
                <p>Let me now give you an overview of how the logistics of these trips worked. Along
                    with the first, secret trip to China, which still ranks No. 1 in terms of drama,
                    the secret trips to Paris to negotiate with the Vietnamese communists and try to
                    negotiate an end to the anguish of this war were clearly dramatic highlights in
                    my experience. There were the national interest and the James Bond aspects of
                    these contacts, the secrecy and the high level of the negotiations, as well as
                    the emotional aspects involved of trying to end a long and bloody war with all
                    the domestic trauma as well.</p>
                <p>(Since the interview in January 2003, Kissinger has published the definitive
                    account of the Vietnam negotiations, “Ending the Vietnam War.” I edited the
                    manuscript, and Kissinger cites me as “my closest associate during the events
                    recounted here.” I commend the book to historians and everyone else interested
                    in those issues.</p>
                <p>Q: I might just mention for the historian of the future that James Bond is the
                    hero of a series of spy novels by the British writer, Ian Fleming.</p>
                <p>LORD: There were some variations on how these meetings worked. I believe that I
                    participated in 19 rounds of secret and semi-public negotiations. Toward the end
                    of this series, a few of these contacts were secret at the time and then made
                    public after they had been held, and I'll get back to that. However, earlier on
                    in this series of contacts, in 1970 and 1971, and in January, 1972, these
                    meetings were secret and never announced. People didn't even know that there
                    were secret negotiations going o- not only the public but also other agencies.
                    Meanwhile, there were sterile public talks with the North Vietnamese in Paris
                    that were essentially propaganda exchanges.</p>
                <p>In January, 1972, President Nixon made a major speech in which he revealed that
                    secret negotiations were going on with the Vietnamese communists. After that, we
                    didn't announce in advance that we were going to meet with the Vietnamese
                    communists, because we didn't want to have people locking themselves into public
                    positions and raising expectations. However, once we had announced in January,
                    1972, that a secret channel was being used, from then on immediately after
                    meetings, we made an announcement that we had met again with the Vietnamese
                    communists and made some general statement about making some progress...or the
                    lack of it.</p>
                <pb facs="0237" n="Page0237"/>
                <p>I went to Paris with Kissinger to negotiate with the Vietnamese communists.
                    Generally, the negotiating team consisted of Kissinger, myself, a Vietnam expert
                    (Dick Smyser, in 1970-1971, and John Negroponte in 1971-1972), plus, at times,
                    Peter Rodman, who was also on Kissinger's staff. Usually, that was about it. The
                    other person who participated from the American side was Maj Gen Vernon Walters,
                    who had a distinguished career later in many other respects, including that of
                    Ambassador to the UN and Ambassador to Germany. He was there as an interpreter,
                    in the sense that in the early going we would present our views in English,
                    Walters would translate them into French, and the North Vietnamese would
                    translate the French into Vietnamese. We finally reached the point where we had
                    an American interpreter (David Engle) who could translate our views directly
                    into Vietnamese. This saved some time and avoided some of the possibilities of
                    inaccuracies resulting from trilateral language use (English to French to
                    Vietnamese and vice versa). Those were the only participants from our side,
                    except for a secretary sometimes in the last stages. In the home stretch
                    Ambassador Sullivan and a legal expert, Aldrich, were also on the team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me just point out what may be obvious, but the
                        SoutVietnamese were not there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: They were not there. We would keep them informed afterwards, through a
                    secret channel through Ellsworth Bunker, our Ambassador to Vietnam in Saigon.
                    This involved double encoding, using a back channel from the White House to
                    Saigon, but only Ambassador Bunker, one Special Assistant, and one communicator
                    knew about it. It was very carefully encrypted and handled on a very close hold
                    basis. Ambassador Bunker would report to South Vietnamese President Thieu, also
                    on a close hold basis, on what had happened. These were general reports. In
                    fact, we did not go into a lot of detail, but it was enough to keep the South
                    Vietnamese generally posted on what was going on. So those were the only people
                    who were aware of these contacts. Our negotiators in Paris who were handling the
                    public sessions were not aware of the secret talks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the public talks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: These were essentially propaganda exchanges which we had inherited from the
                    Johnson administration. I'm trying to remember. Phil Habib headed these public
                    talks at one point. Averell Harriman and Cy Vance before that. Let me give you
                    the logistics on how our secret talks worked, when we flew from Washington.
                    There were a couple of exceptions, e.g. once out of London and once on the way
                    back from China. I'll get back to getting ready for these talks, including the
                    memos and getting President Nixon's approval and the logistics of getting to and
                    from Paris.</p>
                <pb facs="0238" n="Page0238"/>
                <p>For the secret negotiations I would usually leave my NSC office on Friday
                    evening. Without exception, I believe, these sessions took place on weekends
                    and/or public holidays. For example, July 4, Labor Day, and so forth. Otherwise,
                    we handled them on Saturdays and Sundays, that is, the regular weekends. The
                    obvious point was that, since these sessions were secret, we didn't want people
                    wondering where Kissinger was. There would obviously be less notice of his
                    absence over a weekend than in the middle of the week. Al Haig would always
                    cover for Kissinger, saying that he couldn't bother Henry with inquiries during
                    the weekend. So the secret negotiations were always held on the weekend. Only
                    the President, Al Haig, the Deputy Security Adviser; H. R. Haldemann, the
                    President's Chief of Staff; and a few others on the NSC would know about
                    Kissinger's absence.</p>
                <p>So when a secret negotiation was set up, I would leave the NSC office late on a
                    Friday evening, after my usual 80 to 100 hour work week, say goodbye to my
                    colleagues, in effect making the case that I wasn't coming into work the next
                    day for I always came in to work on Saturdays. I would then go home. Early on
                    Saturday morning a White House car would come to my house in Washington, pick me
                    up, and take me to Andrews Air Force Base, where one of the U.S. Air Force
                    Special Mission aircraft would be waiting. These aircraft were reserved for the
                    President, members of the cabinet, and other senior officials designated by the
                    President. Usually, it was Air Force Two, not Air Force One, which the President
                    used. Air Force Two was the aircraft used by the Vice President or a member of
                    the cabinet. It was a VC-137 aircraft [similar in appearance to a Boeing 707
                    jet]. Kissinger, Dick Smyser or later John Negroponte, and sometimes Peter
                    Rodman (latter stages) would also be there.</p>
                <p>We would get on the plane. I forget how we arranged to have classified material
                    placed on the plane. I don't believe that I took it home and guarded it until
                    the White House car came to pick me up and go to Andrews Field. On the way over
                    to Paris we continued to discuss the agenda. Keep in mind that I had already put
                    in an 80 to 100 hour week at the NSC and helped to prepare the briefing books
                    with Dick Smyser or John Negroponte. Kissinger always asked for revisions to
                    these briefing books during the week. He would have a Strategy Paper which
                    President Nixon would approve. He would also have his opening statement, an
                    outline of the probable North Vietnamese position and what our responses should
                    be, what our objectives were for the meeting, defenses against North Vietnamese
                    attacks on our positions, subsequent statements that we might want to use in the
                    course of the meeting beyond the opening statement, and possible contingency
                    language and possible, specific proposals we might put forward. Anyway, this
                    would be a very extensive briefing book. Kissinger would always work on this
                    before he left but would also rework these papers on the way. So we would work
                    all the way over to Paris on the plane.</p>
                <pb facs="0239" n="Page0239"/>
                <p>We would fly into an airfield in central France. I can't remember whether it was
                    a French military or civilian base. It was in the middle of France, not in the
                    Paris area. First, flying into Paris would be too obvious. Secondly, the cover
                    for these flights was that they were training flights for the Air Force. We
                    probably landed at a French military air base for that reason. We would get out
                    of Air Force Two, walk a few steps, and transfer to a smaller French military
                    jet. We would be met at that point by General Walters, who was the Military
                    Attach� in the Embassy in Paris. He was the go between us and the French
                    Government for these flights. He would make arrangements with a man named
                    Jobert, who was a Special Assistant to French president Pompidou, and later
                    Foreign Minister. The French military jet that we used was, in fact, one of
                    president Pompidou's aircraft.</p>
                <p>So we would get into the French president's executive jet with General Walters
                    and fly into a French airport in the Paris area. It was not Orly Airport but
                    some other perhaps military airport in the Paris region. General Walters reveled
                    in this James Bond aspect of the arrangements. On arrival in Paris we got into
                    Walters' car, which was a rental car, not his own car with diplomatic license
                    plates. We drove to his apartment, where we spent the rest of the night. We had
                    code names, because sometimes Walters' French cleaning woman would come in.
                    Luckily, she didn't recognize Kissinger in the morning when we would get up. I
                    forget what his code name was. I had some Jewish code name. I believe it was
                    Lowenstein, for I reasons I can't recall.</p>
                <p>We would arrive at General Walters' apartment. I don't remember the exact time,
                    but there was a time difference; we had left Washington early on a Saturday
                    morning. There is a six hour time difference between Washington and Paris. By
                    the time we got to Walters' apartment, it would be close to midnight, Paris
                    time, so we would pretty much have to go to bed. With the six hour time
                    difference, by then it was late afternoon, Washington time, on Saturday, so we
                    would go to bed, I couldn't sleep. I didn't dare take a sleeping pill. I would
                    usually lie awake and then get to sleep an hour or two before the alarm would go
                    off. We would have to get up at 7:00 AM, Paris time, on the Sunday. That was
                    about 1:00 AM Washington time, or very early on Sunday morning, so it was murder
                    to get up then.</p>
                <pb facs="0240" n="Page0240"/>
                <p>We would then drive to a safe house in one of the suburbs of Paris. The North
                    Vietnamese would be there, waiting for us. We would then have meetings, for
                    never less than three or four hours and sometimes as much as ten hours, during
                    which Smyser and I, and later on, Negroponte, would have to take verbatim notes.
                    We didn't have a secretary with us. We should have taken a stenographer, and I
                    think that we did for some of the later meetings. We also had some help from
                    Peter Rodman when he was on the later trips. So we took verbatim notes. As I
                    mentioned previously, Kissinger really wanted verbatim notes, including his
                    jokes and everything else. Luckily, the translations, even if just from English
                    to Vietnamese and vice versa, gave us some time to catch up in keeping the
                    verbatim notes. However, it was an exhausting experience. This went on for
                    several hours, as I've said. We would take breaks for lunch or tea, take walks
                    and ponder what the other side had said, and discuss strategy. But basically we
                    worked almost steadily for seven hours or so. This was Sunday, of course.</p>
                <p>Then, when we finished, we would drive back to the Paris airport, get into the
                    French President's plane, fly to the air base in central France, pick up Air
                    Force Two, and fly back to Washington. On the way back we worked the entire
                    time, first writing a memo for President Nixon, reporting what had happened,
                    and, perhaps, suggesting where do we go from here. Then we would begin to
                    transcribe our verbatim notes on the meeting. We would get back to Andrews Air
                    Force Base between 9:00 and 11:00 PM, Washington time, on Sunday. Of course, by
                    now it was early Monday morning, Paris time. So I would go home and come into
                    the NSC office on Monday morning, Washington time. By then I was absolutely
                    exhausted. Ostensibly, I not only had not worked throughout the weekend but had
                    had a nice, 48 hour break! I somehow had to look bright and lively as someone
                    would who had had a free weekend off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You remarked how your party went to Paris. Could you talk
                        abouthe attitude and approach of the North Vietnamese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Could I mention first another couple of aspects regarding logistics? I've
                    given you the example of what happened on many of the 19 trips from Washington
                    to Paris to meet with the North Vietnamese. These trips almost always messed up
                    weekends and holidays, although a couple of times we had secret talks as part of
                    public trips elsewhere. Once we went to London for other reasons, and we flew
                    across the English Channel, secretly, to Paris to negotiate with the Vietnamese.
                    Then we flew back to London. On another occasion, in July, 1971, we were in
                    Paris on our way back from a secret trip to China. Not only did the world not
                    know about our secret trip to China, but, while we were publically in Paris, we
                    had secret negotiations again with the North Vietnamese.</p>
                <pb facs="0241" n="Page0241"/>
                <p>In some ways it was even more complicated to keep these discussions with the
                    North Vietnamese secret than these weekend excursions from Washington. Everyone
                    knew that Kissinger was in Paris and was probably following him, in a sense. So
                    we had an elaborate operation working with the American Ambassador, who was
                    Richard Watson. We had to find a way for Kissinger to negotiate with the North
                    Vietnamese without people in Paris knowing about it. So the cover story was that
                    Kissinger was holed up in the Embassy, talking to Ambassador Watson. Dick Smyser
                    and I went off on our own to a big, open plaza looking at the Eiffel Tower.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it at the Place de Trocadero?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, it was the Place de Trocadero. We would wait there. Then Secretary
                    Kissinger slunk down in a car that went out of the back door of the Embassy,
                    since the press was covering the front door. He picked us up at the Place and we
                    went to the meeting place for our negotiation with the Vietnamese. We came back
                    to the Embassy and, while Negroponte and I were writing up the report of the
                    meeting, Kissinger, for cover reasons, went out to a restaurant. Everyone knew
                    about that. In fact, he had a woman named Margaret Osmer as his date, who used
                    to work for ABC Television. She later joined me at the Council on Foreign
                    Relations in New York, many years later, to run my meetings programs. There was
                    a lot of criticism at the time of Kissinger. The press knew that Le Duc Tho, the
                    senior North Vietnamese negotiator, was in Paris at the same time. So the press
                    berated Kissinger, asking why he didn't meet with Le Duc Tho while he was in
                    Paris, to see if he could make some progress with the North Vietnamese, instead
                    of going out with some good-looking blonde to a Paris restaurant. No one knew
                    about the secret negotiations. Of course, this was a cover story for Kissinger,
                    because we had met with Le Duc Tho earlier in the day. That was an amusing
                    aspect, anyway.</p>
                <p>I would suggest, if you agree, that I touch on the Cambodian incursion [in May,
                    1970]. Then, after that, everything else will be essentially all about Vietnam.
                    I can take you right through the negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0242" n="Page0242"/>
                <p>LORD: A few months after the anguishing experience concerning the report I helped
                    to draft on Laos, which I've already described, we had the issue of the
                    Cambodian incursion. Basically, what was happening was that the North Vietnamese
                    were using both Laos and Cambodia as sanctuaries to station their troops. In the
                    case of Laos, they came down the Ho Chi Minh Trail, going to South Vietnam. In
                    the case of Cambodia, North Vietnamese troops were stationed along the
                    Cambodian-Vietnamese border. They would attack South Vietnamese and American
                    troops in South Vietnam by crossing from Cambodia and going into South Vietnam.
                    They attacked American and South Vietnamese troops, inflicted casualties, and
                    then withdrew to the sanctuary of Cambodia. We had some bombing raids of these
                    sanctuaries, but we weren't able to go after them in hot pursuit, because this
                    would mean going into Cambodia. Of course, the North Vietnamese were very good
                    liars and would deny that they were in Cambodia, or Laos, for that matter.</p>
                <p>The bombing of Cambodia began in 1969, and I didn't know about it until I became
                    special assistant to Kissinger. It had been justified, in effect, because the
                    North Vietnamese were killing Americans and South Vietnamese, operating out of
                    sanctuaries which we couldn't get at. The least that we could do was to bomb
                    them, while they were sitting in their bases in Cambodia. Prince Sihanouk, who
                    was in charge of Cambodia in the earlier period, before he was overthrown by a
                    coup d'etat led by Lon Nol, had tolerated the presence of these North Vietnamese
                    in Cambodia. He didn't like Cambodian sovereignty being compromised by the
                    presence of North Vietnamese troops but he couldn't do anything about it, as
                    Cambodia was militarily weak. Therefore, he never protested about American
                    bombing of his territories along the Cambodian-Vietnamese border, which is
                    lightly populated. He knew about these bombing raids, of course. So the bombing
                    wasn't inflicting very many casualties among Cambodian citizens. The bombing was
                    aimed at North Vietnamese bases in Cambodia, near the border.</p>
                <pb facs="0243" n="Page0243"/>
                <p>Of course, the justification for the secrecy of these bombing raids was that, if
                    they became publicly known, Sihanouk would be placed in an impossible position.
                    He felt that he couldn't say that it was all right for the Americans to bomb
                    Cambodian territory. You might think that he could also say that he didn't want
                    North Vietnamese troops to be on Cambodian territory, either. Therefore, these
                    bombing raids had to be kept secret so that we could protect South Vietnamese
                    and American troops, without embarrassing Sihanouk. However, of course, the
                    American Congress and press were outraged that the President was bombing another
                    country, without letting them know what he was doing. Many viewed these bombing
                    raids as illegal, unconstitutional, and an act of war. They refused to accept
                    that there was any reason for doing this, even though they knew that there were
                    North Vietnamese troops stationed in Cambodia and attacking South Vietnamese and
                    American troops in South Vietnam. The Administration in turn pointed out that it
                    was North Vietnam that was violating Cambodia's sovereignty and spreading the
                    war there, as well as Laos. The targets were North Vietnamese troops and bases
                    near the border, and Cambodian casualties were limited. American and South
                    Vietnamese lives were being saved by the bombing. Sihanouk tolerated the bombing
                    so long as it was kept secret. Although a few on Capitol Hill were informed, I
                    believe, extensive briefings would surely have leaked.</p>
                <p>The basic debate that went on in the Nixon administration was that one of the
                    reasons we were having trouble in the war, despite the fact that we were doing
                    all right, was that the North Vietnamese had these sanctuaries in Cambodia as
                    well as Laos. Many in the Nixon administration said that it was wrong for North
                    Vietnamese soldiers to go into South Vietnam and kill South Vietnamese and
                    American soldiers, returning to Cambodia where they would be safe from attack
                    while they violated Cambodian sovereignty.</p>
                <p>So, over time, it was decided that there should be what was called an incursion.
                    An invasion sounds as if we were going into another country. An incursion meant
                    that we were just doing what the North Vietnamese started. It wasn't our fault.
                    And it would be limited in time and space.</p>
                <p>A debate took place within the U.S. Government on several grounds. First, should
                    there be an attack into Cambodia at all? Secondly, if so, should it just be
                    South Vietnamese troops or should it also involve American troops? Thirdly, how
                    long should this incursion last, what should the objectives be, and how deep
                    into Cambodia should the incursion go?</p>
                <p>Of course, the arguments are quite familiar. On the one hand you could argue that
                    we could go in. The enemy was abusing the sanctuaries, and, therefore, it's a
                    matter of hot pursuit. The North Vietnamese troops were already violating
                    Cambodian sovereignty. It would be only fair to protect our people and the South
                    Vietnamese by going after the North Vietnamese. On the other hand, it could be
                    said that we were expanding the war, violating Cambodian sovereignty, no matter
                    what the North Vietnamese had done.</p>
                <pb facs="0244" n="Page0244"/>
                <p>Secondly, it could be argued that the South Vietnamese should do it in defense of
                    their own territory and their border. American troops should not be involved,
                    and this position would be much more supportable. It would be a cleaner
                    operation politically. Therefore, let the South Vietnamese do it. This did not
                    take into account the merits of Vietnamization and whether the South Vietnamese
                    could do as good a job as American troops could do. The South Vietnamese needed
                    our help, and we wanted to make sure that the operation was militarily
                    effective, so we had better be involved.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, there was a debate about the duration and depth of the incursion. This
                    turned, on the one hand, on the view that the longer we were there and the
                    farther we went into Cambodia, the more effective we could be in wiping out
                    North Vietnamese bases. On the other hand the longer and deeper the drive, the
                    more it looked like an invasion and expansion of the war. A big mistake was made
                    in setting the objective for this operation the capturing North Vietnamese
                    headquarters in Cambodia, or COSVN [Committee for South Vietnam]. In fact, COSVN
                    was located in no fixed place. It simply consisted of the top North Vietnamese
                    military and political leaders in Cambodia. They moved around all the time, so
                    it was very hard to pin them down. This got to be a major objective of the
                    Cambodian incursion, and people were thinking of going into Cambodia and
                    capturing some major headquarters. It was a mistake to have that out there as an
                    objective. Some argued that we would have to be in Cambodia for some time, maybe
                    an unlimited period of time, but certainly for a long period of time to do the
                    job right. To do this, we would have to go fairly deep into Cambodia so that the
                    COSVN leaders could not escape and get away from us. We had to mop them up. This
                    was the argument that if we were going to have a domestic uproar in the United
                    States anyway, we might as well do the job right. On the other hand, others made
                    the case that, if we stayed close to the border as such, we would not really be
                    invading Cambodia. If the incursion were brief and limited, people would see
                    that we were just doing this for the purpose of wiping out these North
                    Vietnamese sanctuaries and then coming back, not hanging in there, occupying and
                    destroying that country. These are the kinds of arguments that were made.</p>
                <p>I was skeptical, as were several other people on the NSC staff, about whether the
                    Cambodian incursion was a good idea at all. There were some people who thought
                    that this idea was wrong because it meant expanding the war and because there
                    were moral, if not legal objections to this action. That was not my view. I felt
                    that on strictly legal and moral grounds we were justified in going into these
                    sanctuaries because, after all, the North Vietnamese had destroyed Cambodian
                    sovereignty in those areas. They were coming across the border, killing
                    Americans and South Vietnamese, and then retreating back into Cambodia. It was
                    really unfair to say that we could not go after the North Vietnamese because
                    this really amounted to fighting with one hand tied behind our backs. We had a
                    legal and moral case in my view, so I did not object to the Cambodian incursion
                    on either moral or legal grounds that this amounted to expanding the war and
                    damaging Cambodian sovereignty. I thought that the Nixon administration was
                    correct on those grounds.</p>
                <pb facs="0245" n="Page0245"/>
                <p>However, I nevertheless strongly opposed the Cambodian incursion, certainly the
                    American involvement, though I was less opposed to the South Vietnamese doing it
                    themselves. I did so on two grounds. I was skeptical as to how militarily
                    effective it would be, particularly unless we stayed in Cambodia indefinitely,
                    which would really involve a fundamental change. Maybe we would merely inflict
                    some temporary damage to the North Vietnamese, but they would just reconstitute
                    the damaged structures and facilities they had had, and we would be back where
                    we started.</p>
                <p>Mostly I objected because I felt that, fairly or unfairly, there would be a
                    domestic uproar in the United States and that the American people, media, and
                    Congress would object strongly to this so-called expansion of the war. This
                    would undercut support for what we were trying to do through Vietnamization and
                    serious negotiations. I felt that, whatever military effectiveness we might
                    have, which I thought would be less than some people were proclaiming, this
                    would be counterbalanced by the political damage at home and support for
                    Vietnamization and the negotiations abroad. So I was strongly opposed to the
                    Cambodian incursion. I was most opposed to the American involvement. I was less
                    concerned about South Vietnamese operations in Cambodia, but I recognized that
                    they would be less effective militarily.</p>
                <p>I don't have the dates, but the following episode would have been a couple of
                    days before the final decision was made. At this time in the spring of 1970,
                    before the final decision was made, in an effort to display intellectual rigor
                    and explore the options, he brought into his office five staff people who, he
                    knew, were skeptical about this proposed Cambodian incursion. They included me,
                    Roger Morris, Tony Lake, Bill Watts, and Larry Lynn. There was a very heated
                    discussion with Kissinger. I don't recall how long it went on but I suspect that
                    it was for a good hour and a half. Maybe it went on for two hours and maybe for
                    only one hour. In this discussion all five of us laid out our reasons for
                    opposing the Cambodian incursion. Larry Lynn was the least emotional. He based
                    his opposition on analytical grounds and the prospect that it would be
                    militarily ineffective. Others heavily stressed the more legal and moral
                    arguments. I stressed domestic American reactions as outweighing the possible
                    military advantages. The others also spoke about the anticipated domestic
                    reaction. So the discussion was quite emotional.I don't know what the full
                    impact of this discussion was on Kissinger. He said that it didn't change his
                    mind. He said that he supported going into Cambodia and felt that we should have
                    American troops involved in this operation to make it more effective. I also
                    think that he was somewhat uncomfortable about the limits which had been placed
                    on the duration and depth of the incursion. However, you would have to refer to
                    his memoirs on this subject to get his exact position.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, did you get any feeling at this time that there was pressure from
                    President Nixon, John Ehrlichman, or anyone else in the White House to go ahead
                    with the incursion? Nixon was known to be tough on this issue. Did that
                    consideration play any role in this connection?</p>
                <pb facs="0246" n="Page0246"/>
                <p>LORD: Well, it was clear that President Nixon was very much inclined to go ahead
                    with this operation. I can't recall the position of Secretary of Defense Laird,
                    who was fairly dovish on Vietnam. Secretary Rogers was probably at least
                    hesitant. I don't want to speak for the views of others; they may have been more
                    modulated on this matter. The American military, of course, were in favor of
                    going ahead, for largely military reasons. I believe that Kissinger was never
                    that far away from Nixon on this issue. People like Ehrlichman [Nixon's Domestic
                    Policy Adviser] and Haldemann [Nixon's Chief of Staff] were not going to get
                    into substance. They were concerned about the domestic, political context. I
                    think that, by instinct, they were sort of hawkish on Vietnam, but they were
                    always concerned primarily about President Nixon's political standing. So I
                    don't know what their personal views of the substance were. They certainly
                    weren't a major factor as far as I can recall.</p>
                <p>That night I went home fully intending to resign from the NSC staff. Either it
                    was that night or the next couple of nights, because I really felt strongly
                    about this particular step. I think that I mentioned this at the outset. Once
                    again, I am deeply grateful to my wife, who always took a detached position,
                    looking at the national interest, my personal interests, and their interplay.
                    Her view of the world was similar to mine, moderately dovish but generally
                    supportive of what the administration was trying to do. Of course, I kept her
                    posted on everything I did. I relied on her total discretion. That's the kind of
                    marriage we have, anyway, and I wasn't about to dissipate a marriage by
                    traveling secretly on weekends without explaining what I was doing. I trusted
                    her judgement and total discretion. And I wanted to share all this drama with
                    her.</p>
                <p>So she said: “You're crazy to quit. There are big things to be done here in the
                    next few years. You're working for whoever is in charge. If you leave, your
                    perspectives and arguments on various policies, including Vietnam, Cambodia, and
                    Laos, will be lost, if you're not there, arguing your point of view.” I'm sure
                    that she added that the Administration was trying to negotiate an end to the
                    war. She said that I might not agree with every last position, but more
                    importantly, for the national interest, she felt that I had a good case and that
                    I should hang in there. She felt that my perspective should be heard. And, of
                    course, she was not unaware of the intellectual development and career glory
                    that I would have by working with a brilliant man like Kissinger. She said that,
                    even if I quit over the Vietnam issue, what would I do about the opening to
                    China, or Russia, or other matters? She said that I owed it to myself, to
                    Kissinger, and to President Nixon to hang in there, arguing as much as I could
                    on various issues, but serving the country and serving my own career
                    interests.</p>
                <pb facs="0247" n="Page0247"/>
                <p>If it hadn't been for my wife, I probably would have quit. So I began to think
                    about it. In matters like this, you always wonder whether you are merely
                    rationalizing and whether you are morally compromised by not leaving on an issue
                    that you feel strongly about. Within a few days I came around to her view that I
                    should stay on, for the reasons I have just mentioned. If I ever reached the
                    point where the moral stakes were too high, I would leave. However, in the
                    meantime, my general, strategic views were compatible with the Administration,
                    and there were also the secret negotiations that we were conducting, and all of
                    the other things that we were involved in, like China. These were important
                    goals. I was a key person in pursuing them. I would continue to make my case on
                    various issues, and Kissinger would always listen to me. So I decided to stay
                    on.</p>
                <p>Three of the other four people who attended that meeting quit. Larry Lynn did not
                    quit, certainly Tony Lake, Roger Morris, and William Watts all left. In the case
                    of Watts, this involved the accumulation of frustrations, both bureaucratic and
                    substantive. In the case of Lake and Morris, they had planned to leave anyway.
                    They chose to move up their departure and link it publicly to the issue of
                    Cambodia.</p>
                <p>So that was a close call, the closest I came to resigning during mcareer.</p>
                <p>Q: I don't like to intrude on this, but I've always had trouble over the anguish
                    that went on about Cambodia. I can see that, militarily, one could question the
                    wisdom of the Cambodian incursion. However, the Cambodian-Vietnamese border had
                    been violated again and again. Maybe, as the bureaucratic saying goes, where you
                    stand on an issue like this depends on where you sit. At that point I was
                    sitting in Saigon, perhaps 30 to 40 miles away from the Cambodian-Vietnamese
                    border. I thought the incursion was a pretty good thing. Give the North
                    Vietnamese a little jolt in these sanctuaries, particularly when they were
                    tolerated, or nobody seemed able to do anything about it. I didn't see any great
                    moral question involved in this.</p>
                <p>LORD: I didn't, either.</p>
                <p>Q: So I didn't see that this was a matter calling for resignation. I can see that
                    you might question whether the incursion was really going to work and whether it
                    was more trouble than it was worth. Anyway, that's sort of my perspective.</p>
                <p>LORD: That's a very fair comment. In retrospect it shows you how emotional a time
                    that was. You agree, of course, with my own comments that, in legal and moral
                    terms, after all, it was the North Vietnamese who had destroyed Cambodian
                    sovereignty. The Cambodian incursion, which was an effort to save American and
                    South Vietnamese lives, was strictly limited to two weeks and a few kilometers
                    in depth of Cambodian territory. So we would go into Cambodia and come back out
                    again. How could people get so mad at us and not get mad at the North Vietnamese
                    for using the sanctuaries in Cambodia? So, in that respect, I agree with
                    you.</p>
                <pb facs="0248" n="Page0248"/>
                <p>The fact is that there was a violent reaction in the United States. In many ways
                    I felt somewhat vindicated because we didn't capture the North Vietnamese
                    headquarters, which was a questionable goal to have in the first place.
                    Generally, there was some military effectiveness about the incursion, and I'll
                    get back to that. However, the principal reaction in the United States was
                    fairly violent. Then there was an incident at Kent State University in Ohio
                    which occurred because of the Cambodian incursion. This involved the Governor of
                    Ohio calling out the Ohio National Guard to preserve order on the campus of Kent
                    State University. Some students who demonstrated against the National Guard were
                    killed when the troops opened fire.</p>
                <p>Ironically, given my views on thi- but then I did everything else of this nature
                    for Kissinge- I was assigned to write a report on the results of the incursion.
                    This was done in California, when the President was at the Western White House
                    [in San Clemente, CA]. It would have been done a week or two after the incursion
                    was over. I don't recall precisely when this took place, but it was during the
                    summer of 1970.</p>
                <p>It was a major report, some 30,000 words long. I collected the information and
                    did most of the drafting myself, though I got help from others. I wrote some of
                    the sections and edited some of the others. I recall submitting a draft of the
                    report to Kissinger, about 24 to 36 hours before he was to submit it to the
                    White House. Of course, he...</p>
                <p>Q: This was to be a public report?</p>
                <p>LORD: This was to be a public report, a white paper on the rationale for and the
                    effectiveness of our military incursion into Cambodia. It covered what happened,
                    how we had gotten into it, and what the results were. I don't have the exact
                    date when it was issued.</p>
                <p>I submitted this report to Kissinger. Obviously, it was in draft. It was a
                    shorter form of the full version, which was to be released to the nation no more
                    than 48 or maybe 72 hours later. Kissinger came back to me and said: “This
                    report is useless.” It was not good for my morale, particularly considering the
                    timing. The way he handled this was rather brutal. On the other hand, he gave me
                    a lot of reasons why he was uncomfortable with it. I won't go into them, but his
                    comments covered how the draft was phrased, what should have been emphasized,
                    and what else to put into it. It wasn't so much the compilation of facts but
                    rather the way the narrative ran. I distinctly remember that I considered this
                    draft report as one of the most brilliant drafting jobs that I've ever done.</p>
                <pb facs="0249" n="Page0249"/>
                <p>I sat down and, I think, worked for 12 straight hours at San Clemente,
                    California. I redrafted virtually the whole damned thing. I had to redo lots of
                    it. I don't know how I did it but I worked throughout the night and dumped the
                    product on Kissinger. This left about 48 hours, or perhaps it was 24 hours to go
                    before it was due. I went to bed. Then, when I woke up, he said: “This is a
                    great, a terrific job!” There couldn't have been that much improvement in 24
                    hours. It clearly was a better document. Once again, he intellectually and
                    substantively polished it and made it much better, however brutal the method. So
                    it was a better document, and I think that Kissinger was sincere, in that
                    respect. We were virtually out of time anyway, but I think that the report was
                    greatly improved.</p>
                <p>It was issued. It didn't overly convince people who weren't already convinced,
                    but it was a pretty good paper. At that point it was too early to judge the full
                    military effectiveness of the incursion. However, at that point we were able to
                    report that American and South Vietnamese casualties in the Mekong Delta area,
                    which is near Cambodia and closest to the North Vietnamese sanctuaries, began to
                    decline. Indeed, they did. This was partly because of the effectiveness of the
                    incursion, wiping out and seizing North Vietnamese facilities and equipment. We
                    also used the incursion as justification for further Vietnamization and
                    withdrawal of American forces, because we had reduced the military threat of the
                    sanctuaries in the Cambodian border area. That was the rationale, of course. We
                    put that in. I don't know how much data we had by then on the full impact of the
                    operation. The reality is that over the coming months American and South
                    Vietnamese casualties declined, especially in the areas near Cambodia. And U.S.
                    withdrawals, Vietnamization was speeded up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you redrafted this report, it had to have a basic
                        thrust,since it was a public document. Had you given the wrong thrust to
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I don't recall exactly Kissinger's particular complaints about it. It was
                    perhaps partly the structure, it may have been the arrangement of the sections.
                    However, given the time pressures, I don't recall that I was able to add all of
                    that much in the way of facts. That would have been pretty hard, anyway. I
                    wasn't in Washington, after all, and had limited access to additional material.
                    So I think that it was more a matter of redrafting and rearranging, as opposed
                    to adding new facts. However, I don't recall the details. I just recall that it
                    was a massive paper and that Kissinger had said that it was useless with hours
                    to go. I think useless was clearly too strong a word, although I think that he
                    used that word. He was not pleasant about it. He, figuratively if not literally,
                    threw it on the floor. It was a classic, Kissinger performance.</p>
                <pb facs="0250" n="Page0250"/>
                <p>Frankly, he could also have gotten a better draft out of me, with a different
                    approach. He could have said: “Look, you made a big effort here. Some of the
                    sections are okay, but we still have some major surgery to do. I'm sure that you
                    can do it. Here's what I want.” At least, that's the way I would have handled
                    it. However, he basically said that the draft report was useless and that I
                    would have to start all over.</p>
                <p>Of course, by then I knew enough about how to deal with Kissinger to realize that
                    he didn't really mean that it was useless but he did want major improvements.
                    There were some sections I could essentially revise, and I could figure out
                    where his real problem was. However, I don't recall the specific kind of changes
                    that he wanted. It was a long document, as I say, about 30,000 words long.</p>
                <p>Q: Did the departure of Tony Lake, Roger Morris, and other members of Kissinger's
                    staff have any effect on the NSC staff? Did you circle the wagons, was there
                    unease, or was there a feeling that the staff was a target of the outside?</p>
                <p>LORD: First of all, I would like to draw attention to the revolt among the NSC
                    staff, with the result that people were leaving. This played into the hands of
                    those who were opposed to our policies on Vietnam and Cambodia.</p>
                <p>Secondly, Kissinger always put on a brave front, no matter how badly things were
                    going. He was really good at not letting it show that it was getting to him.
                    However, clearly, he was losing a lot of quality staff, including some extremely
                    bright people. Not only Tony Lake and Roger Morris, but the others as well. It
                    was a very strong staff. Kissinger was losing several people all at once which,
                    by definition, left him at a disadvantage.</p>
                <p>Third, in some cases, and particularly in the case of Tony Lake, he was on close,
                    personal terms with them. So he had personal angst that he was losing some of
                    these people.</p>
                <p>Fourthly, he was caught up, as we all were, in the emotions of the war. He was
                    being attacked by his Harvard colleagues and the press and pictured as a
                    warmonger and so forth, although President Nixon was attacked more fiercely than
                    Kissinger. This added to all of the problems we had. I'm sure that Kissinger was
                    angry as well. You just don't run out in the middle of a crisis. He thought that
                    Lake and Morris were being hypocritical because they had decided to leave
                    anyway. They used their resignations over the Cambodian incursion to grandstand,
                    in his view. Kissinger wondered why there was so much moral outrage. It was the
                    North Vietnamese who had attacked South Vietnam from Cambodia. We had every
                    right to save American and South Vietnamese lives. So this increased the angst
                    in Kissinger's case.</p>
                <pb facs="0251" n="Page0251"/>
                <p>In addition, these resignations surely increased the distrust that the President
                    and the White House staff had of Kissinger's staff which they already considered
                    too liberal. I'm sure that the quality of the work produced by the NSC staff
                    suffered, at least temporarily. This was inevitable, since Kissinger was losing
                    people of high quality. It had been a very strong staff. However, most of the
                    overall staff stayed on, and Kissinger was able to get replacements. I like to
                    think that he was pleased with my performance, for example. The replacements
                    took up the work formerly done by Lake and Morris, although he missed their
                    substantive ideas and memos on other issues. Morris did a lot of work on Africa,
                    and so on. Certainly, the resignation of these people had a psychological
                    impact, but Kissinger still had a strong staff. He believed in what he was doing
                    and he soldiered on.</p>
                <p>I think that one reason that he always treated me better than he treated others,
                    although he could be brutal and just as frank, was partly because I stayed with
                    him during this period. Kissinger knew that I was just as dovish in my instincts
                    as some of the others who had resigned and left. However, I think that from then
                    on he felt grateful that, at a time when he was losing a lot of quality staff
                    members who had reminded him of some of the moral dimensions of the issues and
                    so on, I had stayed on. I received a Christmas present once from him. It was
                    after this period. I forget what the present was, but it was addressed to
                    “Winston Lord, my conscience.” So I think that one reason he treated me better
                    than others was this episode, when I hung in there when other key people left
                    the NSC staff, when it was more politically correct to leave it. He also admired
                    my wife for her strength - he knew, or at least inferred, that she had urged me
                    to stay on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any repercussions within the NSC? I think that
                        it was at this time that a relatively substantial number of junior Foreign
                        Service Officers signed a protest letter to President Nixon over the
                        Cambodian incursion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's a good point. I forget the details. I remember that this did happen.
                    I'm sure that Kissinger's view and that of President Nixon was that Secretary of
                    State Rogers shouldn't have let this happen and should have suppressed this kind
                    of dissent. I don't think that they ever called for these people to be fired, or
                    anything like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is a story that at one point President Nixon sort of
                        lasheout at them.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0252" n="Page0252"/>
                <p>LORD: I'm sure that he did and that he felt that this was another example of the
                    disloyal, liberal Democratic people in the State Department. I'm sure that this
                    was the sort of mood that people like H. R. Haldemann [Nixon's chief of staff]
                    would have had. I'm sure that Kissinger was upset with the State Department
                    officers because of his view that people serving under him should remain loyal
                    when they disagreed. I think that his view was that he didn't like to have
                    people resigning, but you either resign or you stay quiet. You don't protest,
                    certainly publicly, while you are in government service.</p>
                <p>I'm sure that Kissinger also took some heat from H. R. Haldemann and John
                    Ehrlichman [Nixon's chief domestic affairs adviser], if not President Nixon,
                    about Kissinger's liberal staff. Kissinger was always suspected of harboring
                    people holding those views. It was obviously a painful time for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What role did Al Haig play at this particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Haig was certainly on the hawkish side and supported the Cambodian
                    incursion on all the grounds mentioned above. He can speak for himself and has

                    He has displayed total contempt for those who would leave the President, both in
                    terms of loyalty or the lack of it, and in terms of their intellectual approach.
                    I'm sure that he was disdainful of those who left the NSC staff on this issue.
                    He may have been polite or semi-polite in terms of his feelings, but I'm sure
                    that this was his basic reaction as a soldier. He was also hawkish in terms of
                    not deserting your commander-in-chief at a time of crisis. So that was another
                    interesting episode.</p>
                <p>I think that covers Cambodia, and it's time to go back to Vietnam. On Vietnam
                    I've mentioned the logistics and I've sort of touched on how we prepared for the
                    negotiations with the North Vietnamese before we met with them. Dick Smyser,
                    then John Negroponte, and I would work on a memo from Kissinger to the
                    President, saying that we would be meeting again with the North Vietnamese.
                    Here's what is my strategy. So we got President Nixon to sign off on this basic
                    approach to the meeting. We would also prepare opening statements which we might
                    attach as a Tab to the main memorandum, if Nixon wanted to review in detail what
                    Kissinger would say in his opening statement to the North Vietnamese. Basically,
                    the guts of the strategy and our lines would be covered in the memorandum
                    anyway.</p>
                <pb facs="0253" n="Page0253"/>
                <p>So we prepared a memo for Nixon, which included the general approach, and we also
                    prepared Kissinger's opening statement, as I've said. In addition, we assembled
                    some background materials on the facts, and transcripts of previous meetings. We
                    would set out the likely North Vietnamese positions, what we hoped to accomplish
                    and the formula that we might try out, and how we might try to conduct the
                    meetings. These were very careful preparations which, as I've said, we continued
                    to work on the plane trip over. Then, when we would get back, there would be a
                    memorandum from Kissinger to President Nixon, reporting on the meeting and
                    giving his assessment of it. On this, I would get help from Dick Smyser and then
                    John Negroponte.</p>
                <p>Now, as a general proposition partly out of hope and partly out of some evidence,
                    we were probably somewhat more optimistic than Nixon about the possibility that
                    the negotiations might produce real progress. Nixon was more skeptical. He, of
                    course, approved of our doing this, but I think that his basic view was that the
                    North Vietnamese were revolutionaries and that there was little prospect that we
                    would achieve much. Over the course of two or three years Kissinger and I were
                    somewhat more hopeful. Probably Dick Smyser agreed with our view, while
                    Negroponte was probably more skeptical. Nixon, and most likely Haig, probably
                    felt that we weren't getting very far. They didn't go so far as to say that the
                    North Vietnamese were simply fooling us, but Nixon suspected that there was no
                    real give in their position. Nevertheless, he approved of our continuing with
                    the negotiations, on the off chance that we could make a breakthrough. In any
                    event, Nixon knew that, for the historical record and when the secret
                    negotiations were made public at some point, he could say: “Look, I was trying
                    to be reasonable.” He was trying to protect his domestic flank.</p>
                <p>Not to mention, to be uncynical about it, that Nixon genuinely wanted to end the
                    war. He didn't want to have Americans and South Vietnamese killed. He wanted to
                    turn to other issues. He wanted to end our domestic strife. He wanted to end the
                    war with credibility and honor. So if there was some chance that the
                    negotiations might work, fine. However, basically, I think that Nixon was
                    somewhat more skeptical than we were.</p>
                <p>There were times when we thought that there was possible progress, if we looked
                    carefully. I remember specifically the July 1971, meeting, after we came back
                    from the secret trip to China and then met secretly with the North Vietnamese in
                    Paris. We thought that Le Duc Tho [chief North Vietnamese negotiator] and his
                    deputy, Xuan Thuy, were somewhat more forthcoming. On this occasion I recall
                    Kissinger and I thought: “Boy, we may have pulled ofa double header on this
                    trip.” Not only was there a dramatic opening to China, but maybe we had made a
                    significant advance in the Vietnam negotiations.</p>
                <pb facs="0254" n="Page0254"/>
                <p>A couple of general points. When we met with the North Vietnamese, they would
                    have either one or another head of delegation. Either Le Duc Tho or Xuan Thuy. I
                    once made a pun when we were complaining to each other about Xuan Thuy's
                    performance, which didn't add up to very much. I said: “Xuan Thuy (Wan Twee)
                    doesn't make a forest.” So if the North Vietnamese delegation was headed only by
                    Xuan Thuy, we knew that he didn't have the authority to do much and the meeting
                    would be a holding action effort. He was something like a deputy foreign
                    minister. He couldn't negotiate seriously. He would simply repeat their
                    positions.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, if the North Vietnamese leader was Le Duc Tho, there was a
                    chance of his being serious. He was Number Five in rank in the Politburo. He was
                    a major political figure and could speak authoritatively for Hanoi. Xuan Thuy
                    was more of a bureaucrat than a representative with his own authority. We never
                    expected very much from Xuan Thuy, although we would still make statements in
                    his presence. We knew that they would go back to Hanoi and be read carefully
                    there. We kept the process going but we hoped that there would be more
                    progress.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have a feeling, either in the back of your minds or more overtly that
                    we didn't know where these negotiations were going? Did we think that the North
                    Vietnamese were a very difficult group and that maybe they wouldn't do anything?
                    However, the other alternative was that eventually we might just pull out of the
                    negotiations, and Vietnamization would take over. Of course, that would still
                    have left the American prisoners of war in detention in Hanoi.</p>
                <p>LORD: That's fairly put. We hoped, through a combination of negotiation and
                    pressure when appropriate, that we could bring an end to the war. There were
                    times, as we were carrying out the Vietnamization program, that we would step up
                    the bombing of North Vietnam, and make proposals at the secret negotiations in
                    Paris. We thought that the two strands of action might bring about a negotiated
                    settlement. However, the Vietnamization program was under way and we did not
                    know what the North Vietnamese time table was. In effect, if they did not agree
                    to a negotiated settlement at some point, we would effectively be out of Vietnam
                    and in a supportive position to the South Vietnamese. But you're absolutely
                    right. This would still have left the prisoner problem. So I guess that the
                    feeling was that, once we got to a certain point, and we hoped that it wouldn't
                    take us long, we would negotiate the status of our prisoners of war, while
                    completing the withdrawal of our troops. I've already said that the major
                    tension that we had with U.S. troop withdrawals was that we were reducing our
                    troop levels unilaterally and without North Vietnamese concessions. So,
                    therefore, the North Vietnamese could just sit there and wait for us to continue
                    to pull out of Vietnam. The key assessment of that situation would turn on how
                    strong did we and Hanoi think the South Vietnamese would eventually be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that the opening to China might have undercut
                        thNorth Vietnamese position somewhat?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0255" n="Page0255"/>
                <p>LORD: We felt that the openings to both China and Russia would help us. As I said
                    earlier, President Nixon put great weight on the Russian dimension in particular
                    in adding to the psychological isolation of Hanoi. When Hanoi saw that their two
                    patrons were dealing with us, particularly at the time of the summit meetings of
                    1972, Nixon thought that Hanoi might get concerned and progress might be made.
                    While we were fighting in Vietnam and simultaneously were meeting with the
                    Russians and Chinese at the highest level, this would cause some unease in
                    Hanoi. Secondly, the Russian and Chinese leaders had a stake in the development
                    of our bilateral relationship. The Vietnamese conflict was an ideological and a
                    political brake and irritant in our relationship. Nixon thought that the
                    Russians and Chinese would lean on Hanoi to make a reasonable deal with us as
                    they could move ahead with their bilateral ties with us.</p>
                <p>In our contacts with the Russians and Chinese we essentially said: “Look, please
                    tell Hanoi that we are not unreasonable, that we're willing to have an honorable
                    settlement. However, it's got to be a military settlement. You cannot expect us
                    to sell out our allies, overthrow the Saigon government, as we pull out.” Our
                    basic pitch was that we were prepared to leave Vietnam, and let the Vietnamese
                    decide on their political future. As we went on, we got more and more precise
                    about leaving unilaterally, if not on a mutual basis. We wanted a cease-fire and
                    the return of our prisoners of war. However, what we were not prepared to do was
                    to overthrow the Thieu Government in South Vietnam and have a coalition
                    government to replace it. I think that we began to introduce the themes of
                    reconciliation and maybe even economic assistance to Vietnam as additional
                    incentives. We said that this was a reasonable outcome for Hanoi. Moreover,
                    consider that we're trying to develop a bilateral relationship with you. From
                    your standpoint, the Vietnam War is getting in the way and is a distraction in
                    the way of improving relations with you. So it's in your interest to get this
                    Vietnam War out of the way, not to mention showing that we can work together on
                    some of these issues.</p>
                <p>We hoped that this line with the Chinese and Russians would help the
                    negotiations. We knew that, by itself, it wouldn't be decisive, but we thought
                    that, combined with military pressure and a reasonable negotiating position, it
                    would help to end the war. Now, we can't be sure how much Russia and China
                    weighed in with Hanoi. We're quite sure, without having actual proof, that Zhou
                    En-lai and others did not think that our position was unreasonable.</p>
                <p>There is some circumstantial evidence that the Chinese, in their own interests,
                    conveyed our rationale to Hanoi. In our discussions, Zhou would urge us to get
                    out to Vietnam, but I don't recall his urging us to overthrow the Saigon
                    government. The pitch that we made in terms of their national interest was that
                    Hanoi ought to accept our proposals. They could spin this further by pointing
                    out to Hanoi that the Saigon Government was weak and that it might be taken over
                    eventually, once the Americans were out of Vietnam. Their considerations perhaps
                    appealed to Hanoi, but I think that Hanoi was independent enough that it
                    wouldn't fold under pressure from either Russia or China.</p>
                <pb facs="0256" n="Page0256"/>
                <p>Of course, in retrospect, we now know how much China and North Vietnam opposed
                    each other. They fought their own war along the Sino-Vietnamese border a few
                    years later. I don't think that the China equation had a major impact on Hanoi.
                    However, this was certainly one of the reasons that we opened up to China and
                    tried to improve relations with Russia, although this was not the main reason. I
                    think that, around the edges, it probably helped us with Hanoi, and we finally
                    got a settlement in 1973, which I'll discuss later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you want to stop now or would you like to
                        continue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Let's continue for a couple of more minutes. I thought that would cover
                    some general material points.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, until we got to the fall of 1972, there were times when Le Duc Tho
                    [chief Hanoi negotiator in the Paris peace talks] was somewhat more polite than
                    others. There may have been times when they showed a more enhanced flexibility.
                    But if you were really hard headed about it, you'd have to say that the North
                    Vietnamese really didn't move very much throughout this period, despite our
                    succeeding proposals. Sometimes, their positions in the secret negotiations were
                    tougher than their positions in the public talks in Paris. They had public
                    positions which, as I say, were more generous than those in the secret
                    talks.</p>
                <p>Also, Le Duc Tho often had headaches. When he had a headache, we knew that he
                    wasn't going to be flexible or forthcoming. He'd get a headache, and this
                    signaled his attitude. I think that it's also fair to say, and this is a sad
                    commentary on human nature, that Hanoi generally was more forthcoming when we
                    were hitting them hard, militarily. They were also friendlier. They were more
                    arrogant and intransigent when they seemed to be doing well, militarily and/or
                    we were letting up on the pressure. That's just the way it worked.</p>
                <p>In late January 1972, the President's speech revealed the secret negotiations and
                    our forthcoming negotiating stand. From then on we announced that negotiations
                    had been held after they took place. The friendlier that Hanoi was in describing
                    the meetings afterwards, (they were holding their own press conferences), the
                    chances were that they were tougher, internally. This may have been because they
                    were trying to show American public opinion that they were being reasonable. To
                    the extent that they were firm and fairly tough in their accounts of the
                    meetings afterwards, the chances were that they were more forthcoming in the
                    talks that we had had. They were trying to cover up somewhat greater flexibility
                    on their side by using tough rhetoric publicly.</p>
                <p>I don't want to exaggerate this, because until September-October 1972, they made
                    no real major moves. Nevertheless, there were times in 1971-72 that we came from
                    the meetings, more discouraged than at other times, when we were more
                    encouraged.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feel about who was giving them advice?
                        How werthey getting their reading of American public opinion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's a good question. This accounted for a lot in the negotiations. We
                    would constantly say to them, hopefully without being overly defensive about it:
                    “Don't count on American public opinion and don't insult us because, first of
                    all, we're going to pursue our national interest anyway.” Secondly, we said that
                    when the North Vietnamese talked to people like Jane Fonda [Hollywood actress
                    and anti-war activist and the daughter of actor Henry Fonda], liberal members of
                    Congress, and media figures, they should realize that these people did not
                    represent all of America. We said that there was a great, silent majority out
                    there which supported our efforts in Vietnam. So we said that if the North
                    Vietnamese thought that they were going to make us capitulate because of
                    American public opinion, they were sadly mistaken. We said that we had
                    sufficient public support, plus President Nixon was going to do the right thing,
                    and the North Vietnamese would not be able to humiliate our world position and
                    credibility by forcing us to accede to their demands. That was our basic
                    pitch.</p>
                <p>Le Duc Tho and Xuan Thuy were always trying to work in the view that the American
                    people wanted us to end our involvement in Vietnam and that we didn't have
                    public support. Whenever they cited domestic public opinion in the U.S.,
                    Kissinger hit them very hard. You would have to look at the memoirs of the North
                    Vietnamese to know what their actual views were. I think that, on the whole, the
                    conventional wisdom is correct that they thought that the support of American
                    public and Congressional opinion for the war was dissolving and that they had us
                    on the run. That was one reason that they felt that they could afford to be
                    intransigent, both because they felt that, over time, they were going to be
                    stronger than the South Vietnamese when they had to take them on directly, and
                    because American public opinion was undercutting President Nixon. In any event,
                    after all, we were withdrawing unilaterally under the Vietnamization program, so
                    they could afford to sit there and be tough.</p>

                <p>Their instinct as revolutionaries was not to negotiate a compromise. They don't
                    have the same, American instinct to try and split the difference and find a
                    negotiated end on the basis of a yearning for peace. The North Vietnamese
                    negotiators had fought for a long time for their goals against the French and
                    us. They had been around a long time and were willing to continue the
                    negotiations for a long time. So they were not in a mood to compromise. So all
                    of this made it extremely difficult. They got some of their views of American
                    public opinion from their reading of the American media, from American visitors
                    to Hanoi, even people who were pro-Viet Cong and pro-North Vietnamese. I might
                    say that the North Vietnamese might have concluded that they had better not
                    exaggerate things. There was still some American support for the war, and the
                    President was not going to give in to North Vietnamese demands. But on the
                    whole, they must have been encouraged by the debates and demonstrations in our
                    country. They couldn't help but be influenced by them. This became a more and
                    more decisive consideration when Congress began reducing the aid we had promised
                    to supply the South Vietnamese, the incident at Kent State, and the
                    demonstrations against American actions. So this certainly fed their
                    intransigent stance in the negotiations.</p>
                <p>Now and then President Nixon would order some strong, military actions, such as
                    in April-May 1972, when he ordered the mining of the harbor at Haiphong and the
                    bombing of Hanoi. He was trying of course to prevail on the battlefield and
                    improve our situation in response to North Vietnamese aggression. But it was
                    clearly also intended to keep the North Vietnamese off balance. President Nixon
                    seemed to hope that the North Vietnamese would be more willing to negotiate, if
                    they figured that they were dealing with somebody who was unpredictable in the
                    White House, whatever the state of public opinion, who was going to take a whack
                    at them.</p>
                <p>We'll get back to this, but the North Vietnamese basically had to worry what
                    Nixon, whom they may have considered a madman, might do if he were reelected in
                    November 1972, and no longer had to worry about being reelected again. Then he
                    could do whatever the hell he wanted to do. Having seen by then the May 1972,
                    bombing of Hanoi and mining of the harbor of Haiphong and then, later, of
                    course, the Christmas bombings in December, 1972, the North Vietnamese must have
                    felt concerns. We would tell them not to pay attention to our critics or
                    interfere in our domestic affairs. We would say, by the way, that we have a
                    madman in the White House who doesn't give a damn about public opinion. We would
                    say that he cares about America's position in the world and suggest that he was
                    going to beat the hell out of the North Vietnamese if they were not
                    reasonable.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the nomination and campaign of George McGovern [Democratic Party
                    presidential nominee who was notably opposed to our policies on Vietnam]? Or
                    should we postpone discussion of that?</p>
                <p>LORD: I'd rather reserve that, because it was directly relevant to the
                    breakthrough in the negotiations and why there was a breakthrough.</p>
                <pb facs="0259" n="Page0259"/>
                <p>I'd like to make one other point on the North Vietnamese style of negotiations.
                    I've already mentioned that their style was to hang in there, maybe being
                    friendly on some occasions and tough on other occasions. However, essentially,
                    and month after month, and year after year, their basic position was to call for
                    a unilateral, U.S. withdrawal, the establishment of a coalition government in
                    Saigon, and to stick with all these positions, in a revolutionary spirit. They
                    tended to look to their long investment in what they were doing, feeling that
                    domestic support for the U.S. position was crumbling, for all of the reasons
                    that I've mentioned. So they basically sought to wear us down. They would come,
                    essentially as a part of their negotiating style, to listen to our positions and
                    see whether the United States was going to make more concessions and move closer
                    to what they wanted.</p>
                <p>This is in contrast to other, negotiating styles, if I may digress briefly.
                    Kissinger was very good at understanding and negotiating with different
                    interlocutors, depending on their cultural and historical styles. For example,
                    in the case of the Chinese, he preferred their negotiating style the most.
                    Basically, they would take a position on principle. Then each side would
                    establish its basic principles and state what it had to have, at a minimum.
                    Then, within this framework, we would negotiate about reaching an agreement. At
                    the beginning the Chinese would avoid exaggerating or inflating their positions
                    and then bargain them down, like rug merchants, (and like the Russians). I'm
                    talking about the Chinese style in the 1970s, not in the 1990s. They have a much
                    more conventional, haggling approach today.</p>
                <p>In negotiations the Russians are more like rug merchants. They inflate their
                    positions, exaggerate what they need, and expect you to do the same. Then you
                    can haggle, haggle, and haggle, and finally reach an agreement. Even then you
                    have to be careful about how they would implement the agreement, whereas we felt
                    the Chinese carried out their obligations.</p>
                <p>The Israelis were like Talmudic scholars and lawyers. They have an understandable
                    sense of insecurity, given their history and the fact that they are surrounded
                    by the Arabs. They were very cautious about every semi-colon and every last
                    detail of every negotiation. They would haggle and set out to exhaust you with
                    their suspicions of the Arabs. Kissinger, for example, would go to Golda Meir or
                    Rabin, or whomever we were negotiating with. The Israelis would present 10
                    demands or requests from the Egyptians. Kissinger would go to President Anwar
                    Sadat of Egypt, get agreement on nine out of 10, go back to Tel Aviv, and
                    present this to the Israelis. Then the Israelis, instead of being grateful for
                    getting nine out of 10 of their demands, would complain that he hadn't gotten
                    the 10th demand for them. Anwar Sadat was more romantic and emotional. He was
                    willing to take a big step as a visionary, as long as Kissinger appealed to
                    Egyptian dignity, self interest, and so on.</p>
                <p>So it was very interesting to see the various, negotiating styles, including the
                    North Vietnamese practice of just wearing you down and waiting to hear your
                    concessions. In retrospect, they had no real intention of compromising until
                    they had real incentives to do so, as they did in the fall of 1972.</p>
                <pb facs="0260" n="Page0260"/>
                <p>Q: What about the style that so often appears when the North Vietnamese give you
                    long, historical harangues, even in the secret negotiations?</p>
                <p>LORD: Absolutely. That's a very good point. We would often, particularly in the
                    opening statements, have to sit through a very familiar, re-hash of allegations
                    of U.S. interference in a civil conflict, alleged U.S. atrocities, not to
                    mention the debate in the United States about our approach. You're absolutely
                    right. Time and again the North Vietnamese would go through their history with
                    the French and Americans. They would say that they have lasted through this
                    period and that period and that they were going to outlast us. They would say
                    that it's their country and demand that we should stay out of their business.
                    They would say that we were killing innocent people.</p>
                <p>Probably the major difference we had in the various meetings is that sometimes
                    they would make this basic speech shorter or maybe even dispense with it. We
                    would get more hopeful over the tone. Then, at other times, they would go on at
                    greater length but ostensibly become somewhat more flexible, having made their
                    point and they could send their transcript of the meeting back to the
                    Politburo.</p>
                <p>Q: How did our records reflect what went on at the meetings? Did they indicate
                    that the discussion was all very nice, but let's get to the substance of the
                    negotiation?</p>
                <p>LORD: Kissinger had a good sense of humor, but sometimes it did not lend itself
                    to those meetings. With all of his interlocutors, including the Russians, the
                    Chinese, the Israelis, the Egyptians, and the Vietnamese he made jokes. He and
                    Lu Duc Tho would often go off and walk around privately and it would seem they
                    were having serious discussions.</p>
                <p>Kissinger was very hard-headed, of course. He was not na�ve. He was with
                    hard-headed revolutionaries, representing national interests. He knew that they
                    would not suddenly become more flexible because they liked Henry Kissinger.
                    However, Kissinger felt that there was still something to be said, even with
                    this group of North Vietnamese, even more than with other interlocutors, for
                    trying to have some personal relationship. He would break the tension, at times,
                    with humor. He would try to establish his credibility for carrying out
                    commitments and respectability for genuinely seeking agreement. Maybe personal
                    touches would help around the edges. Then, when Le Duc Tho or Xuan Thuy would
                    report back to the Politburo, they would draft their reports somewhat more
                    favorably than might otherwise be the case. Kissinger had no illusions that this
                    effort would make a significant difference in this respect. I think that he was
                    correct in trying to do that. It never hurts to try and be more personable, so
                    long as one has no illusions about the real impact.</p>
                <pb facs="0261" n="Page0261"/>
                <p>By the same token, Kissinger would be very tough and sharp if he thought that
                    Hanoi was getting arrogant. He would come back hard at them, either in the
                    plenary session, or he might well do it, one on one, so that there wouldn't be
                    quite so much face lost. Or he might convey privately, in some discussion, some
                    particularly ominous message from the President. He might say that the President
                    was running out of patience, or whatever it was. So he would try to use
                    different techniques of his own with the North Vietnamese. It was
                    fascinating.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have the feeling, as you entered these negotiations, “Okay, this is
                    somewhat a Kabuki exercise. Is it going to take three or four years in order to
                    get from here to there?”</p>
                <p>LORD: No, we were a little bit more optimistic than that. I wouldn't want to make
                    us look naive. We acted differently at some meetings than at others. We thought
                    that we owed it to the American people and to the American soldiers, not to
                    mention our South Vietnamese allies, to try to negotiate an end to this war. So
                    even if it looked almost hopeless or might appear to be a kabuki drama, whatever
                    the slim chance that we could end the war through negotiations, we had an
                    obligation to continue to try. That was the first consideration.</p>
                <p>The second consideration, of course, was the calculation that if and when we ever
                    made this account public, it would show the American people and Congress that we
                    had made a good faith effort to end the anguish of the war. We would then have
                    their support to do whatever we still had to do, which turned out to be the case
                    in January 1972. It wasn't cynical, in the sense that we were just doing it so
                    that we could show that we were reasonable. It was a genuine effort to end the
                    war. There was also the feeling that it was not us that had kept the war going.
                    It was Hanoi which had kept this tragedy going on.</p>
                <p>We genuinely were searching for ways to end the war, consistent with our honor,
                    to search for North Vietnamese flexibility, in the hope that we could make real
                    progress. At a minimum, we sought to show that we had been reasonable. In our
                    own mind we did this also to satisfy our own moral and political instincts and
                    try to end the war as soon as possible. So there were all considerations.
                    Sometimes, as I said, we were fairly upbeat, as we were in July, 1971. At times
                    we were pretty discouraged. We never would sit down and conclude that this
                    process was going to take years. We thought that it would take months, if we did
                    not reach a breakthrough in weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any reading in your conversations with
                        Kissinger as thow he evaluated Le Duc Tho?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0262" n="Page0262"/>
                <p>LORD: Oh, yes, sure. We talked about that all the time. Kissinger was quite
                    impressed with Le Duc Tho. He felt essentially that Xuan Thuy did not have much
                    authority. Kissinger felt that Xuan Thuy was a moderately competent bureaucrat
                    who was just mouthing Hanoi's position. Kissinger recognized that Le Duc Tho was
                    a tough customer, a long time revolutionary. At times Kissinger would get
                    irritated with Le Duc Tho, particularly when he would get arrogant. He would get
                    frustrated when Le Duc Tho would try his patience, not only at one particular
                    meeting but over many months and years. Kissinger felt that Le Duc Tho was a
                    skillful presenter of Hanoi's position, however annoying he was at times. Le Duc
                    Tho had authority. We always felt that he was presenting Hanoi's view, even if
                    it was usually somewhat discouraging. But I think that Kissinger had a grudging
                    respect for Le Duc Tho.</p>
                <p>Q: Did the tea breaks and the luncheons, particularly with the Soviets, provide
                    an occasion where people get together and mix and mingle a little bit? Was there
                    any of that with the North Vietnamese?</p>
                <p>LORD: A modest amount. I would talk to some people at my level, and Kissinger
                    would talk to Le Duc Tho or Xuan Thuy. Or there would be a more general
                    conversation around the table.</p>
                <p>However, as we got toward the end of the negotiations and were making real
                    progress, then it got to b- well, friendly is too strong a wor- but there was
                    some camaraderie and some shared experience. There was some joking as we began
                    to make progress toward the end. Before the fall of 1972, I would say that these
                    contacts were pretty modest. I didn't get the feeling of expressions of great
                    candor, letting down one's guard, or real camaraderie, even though there were
                    some jokes exchanged which they would laugh at. We would try to make these
                    contacts more human around the edges, but there were never any real
                    exchanges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the French intrude in these discussions at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No. They were very cooperative in setting up the logistics, but they didn't
                    offer any views on substance. They didn't interfere in any way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where are we now?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0263" n="Page0263"/>
                <p>LORD: We can get to some of the milestones of the negotiations with the North
                    Vietnamese. One other point on the domestic mood in the United States. I don't
                    have a date, but there was a young person named Brian McDonnell who was fasting
                    outside the White House in Washington, in protest against the continuation of
                    the war. He was literally on a hunger strike and was in danger of wasting away.
                    Without any publicity Kissinger came out of the White House and talked to him.
                    He got me directly involved as a kind of house conscience. Kissinger talked to
                    him, listened to him, tried to explain what we were up to, and then invited him
                    and his wife, who was an African-American, to have dinner with my wife, Bette,
                    and me, as well as Kissinger.Kissinger persuaded this young man to end his fast,
                    although we didn't change our policy, obviously. So it was a nice gesture by
                    Kissinger, not consistent with his public image, certainly, and one which he
                    never publicized. I'm not sure that news of this meeting ever got out. I recall
                    no more details on that.</p>
                <p>There were some milestones in our negotiations which were more memorable than
                    others, although it's hard for me to reconstruct specific milestones now. [By
                    far the most detailed and authoritative account was published after the
                    interview - “End of the Vietnam War” by Kissinger.]</p>
                <p>One milestone I should mention briefly, and I've already alluded to it, was May,
                    1971, probably over Memorial Day, since we always went to Paris on holidays or
                    weekends at this time. We presented what we considered an extremely significant
                    proposal to move the negotiations forward, which in fact was brought out in the
                    eventual settlement signed in January, 1973. I recall how we agonized over
                    trying to make a major proposal. I don't recall why, but the timing was such
                    that we tried to make a breakthrough at that point. I believe that it was a
                    seven point proposal, which was essentially a military settlement only,
                    consistent with President Nixon's principle of being willing to be flexible on
                    the military side, but not on the political side.</p>
                <p>This proposal included a date for total unilateral U.S. withdrawal of forces. It
                    dropped the position of mutual withdrawal. We recognized that Vietnamization and
                    congressional pressures were making our forces useless as a bargaining chip. The
                    only condition was the cessation of North Vietnamese infiltration of all of
                    Indochina. The other basic elements of the proposal included a cease-fire
                    throughout Indochina, the return of American prisoners, international
                    supervision, and independence for Laos and Cambodia. The political future of
                    South Vietnam was left to the South Vietnamese. I don't recall the initial,
                    North Vietnamese reaction or whether they acknowledged the significance of this
                    proposal. Probably not. But unilateral withdrawal was one of their major
                    objectives. I suspect that the North Vietnamese were not generous in their
                    response. Surely they were smart enough to recognize that this proposal was of
                    major significance. Indeed it was the essence of the settlement they agreed to
                    sixteen months later.</p>
                <pb facs="0264" n="Page0264"/>
                <p>I mention this because it was consistent with earlier positions and demonstrate
                    again that the January 1973 settlement could have been reached earlier if Hanoi
                    had been reasonable. For example, the Presidential Statement of November, 1969,
                    which called for a cease-fire in place. You could interpret this to mean that
                    the North Vietnamese were remaining at least temporarily in South Vietnam. So
                    the record will show, especially from 1971 on, that we couldn't have reached the
                    final deal of January 1973 any sooner than we did, contrary to critics'
                    assertions. These critics have been totally irresponsible on this point. The
                    historical record is irrefutable on this point.</p>
                <p>We would constantly refer to this approach, that is, the military solution only.
                    We were not willing to overthrow our allies in the Saigon Government. I cite
                    this also because, as I've already mentioned, this is the response to those who
                    say that we should have and could have gotten the eventual settlement years
                    earlier. They have to understand that Hanoi would not settle on this basis. They
                    only settled when they could see how the 1972 presidential elections in the
                    United States were going to turn out. Prior to this time they didn't accept this
                    proposal, and there is no evidence that they were ever ready to accept anything
                    less than the formation of a coalition government and the overthrow of President
                    Nguyen van Thieu.</p>
                <p>So that was one meeting (May 1971) that was significant. I think that, having
                    made this proposal, we were hopeful that, when Hanoi looked at it, they would
                    realize that this was significant. However, there certainly was no immediate
                    breakthrough at the time. I think that the tone of this meeting was relatively
                    good. Again, I would direct you to Kissinger's memoirs at this point.</p>
                <p>I've also mentioned that the next meeting after this proposal was made was the
                    July 1971 session in Paris, when we were on our way back from Pakistan and
                    China, we snuck out secretly from our Paris embassy, as I've already mentioned.
                    This was a moderately good meeting because they made a somewhat less negative
                    reply to our May 1971 proposals. We thought that there might be some movement in
                    the negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that the North Vietnamese were aware of the
                        progresbeing made in the negotiations with China?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0265" n="Page0265"/>
                <p>LORD: I don't think so. Certainly, we didn't tell them. Now, whether the Chinese
                    informed their North Vietnamese allies, I don't know. This was between the time
                    when we had been secretly to China, just a few days earlier, and the time when
                    President Nixon publicly announced the agreement reached with the Chinese in San
                    Clemente, California, a few days later. We were on our way back to San Clemente
                    to report to the President on the trip and the negotiations on the opening to
                    China. I suspect that the North Vietnamese didn't know. It hadn't come out
                    publicly. We certainly wouldn't have told them. We kept this secret until Nixon
                    released this bombshell in San Clemente. I suspect that the North Vietnamese had
                    not been told of this development by the Chinese.</p>
                <p>Q: I take it that the North Vietnamese were not prone to leak material on the
                    talks. You were pretty sure that they weren't going to leak or let people know
                    what they were up to.</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, they didn't leak the fact that they had secret talks going on with
                    us. They probably figured that if we were going to be flexible, we would only do
                    this secretly, in view of American public opinion. They would get more out of us
                    if the fact of the talks were kept secret. So they probably thought that it was
                    in their interest to keep them secret.</p>
                <p>The North Vietnamese might also have felt that it would discourage the morale of
                    their own troops and the Viet Cong [communist forces indigenous to South
                    Vietnam] if it looked as if they were negotiating an end to the war. They had
                    their own interest in keeping the negotiating process secret.</p>
                <p>However, the North Vietnamese played a really nefarious game with world opinion,
                    and we would catch them up on this. As I mentioned, they would sound forthcoming
                    in public on their seven-, eight-, or nine-point plan. Then they would be much
                    less forthcoming in their actual positions in the secret negotiations, which,
                    after all, were the authoritative negotiations. So the North Vietnamese played
                    public opinion to a fare-thee-well. This was not leaking, but it was being more
                    forthcoming in public than they were in reality. That was annoying, to say the
                    least.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we play the same game? Did we ever use the
                        publinegotiations for any particular purpose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Not really, no. The public Paris talks were a propaganda exercise. We tried
                    generally to be forthcoming in public, but we were more forthcoming, for
                    example, in this May 1971 secret proposal than we were in public. Our public
                    position still essentially cited mutual withdrawal of North Vietnamese and U.S.
                    forces, although we were more subtle in the speech by President Nixon in
                    November 1969, with its ceasefire in place. However, in public we were much less
                    forthcoming than in the private proposals.</p>
                <pb facs="0266" n="Page0266"/>
                <p>You had this strange situation where we were more forthcoming in private than we
                    were publicly. The North Vietnamese were more forthcoming publicly than they
                    were privately. Of course, it was the private negotiations that were the more
                    authoritative ones.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any interplay between the public meetings and the secret
                    meetings?</p>
                <p>LORD: I think that the best appraisal is that we would hang tougher in the public
                    sessions than in the private sessions. In the interest of public opinion and
                    international propaganda we always tried to make our position look at least
                    reasonable, but in terms of substance we would reserve any real flexibility for
                    the private, secret talks. I don't recall any interplay beyond that.
                    Considerations of timing were not important.</p>
                <p>I forget how the public meetings went, whether they were held once a week or once
                    a month. I don't recall this. They were pretty well developed. Both sides,
                    essentially, presented their public positions, appealing to international
                    opinion. We knew that there would never be any real progress in the public
                    talks. We have already talked about secrecy in discussing the opening to China.
                    I agreed with it but there was a certain price that we paid, i.e. with Japan.
                    The rationale for secrecy in the Vietnam negotiations was entirely justified.
                    That is, if there was ever going to be any progress, each side had to be able to
                    speak freely, without having to worry about their domestic opinion, their
                    allies, or anything else.</p>
                <p>In our case we also had the South Vietnamese Government to consider. (Hanoi, of
                    course, totally controlled the Viet Cong.) We kept them generally posted. We
                    would send off a cable on the secret meetings for the information of Ambassador
                    Bunker in Saigon, but being careful to not scare the South Vietnamese. We did
                    not wish to betray them, but, in fact, we went beyond what we were telling them
                    through Bunker. We didn't want to get President Thieu prematurely excited about
                    the sessions and try to lock us in on tough positions. I think that it's fair to
                    say that we were less than totally forthcoming with the South Vietnamese and
                    that we rounded off some of the edges in the reporting on the secret sessions
                    which we sent to Ambassador Bunker to draw on in his discussions with President
                    Thieu. On the other hand, most of the ideas floated in Paris were somewhat
                    tentative and exploratory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any feedback from President Thieu as to
                        what yowere doing? Did he feel that you were giving away the store?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0267" n="Page0267"/>
                <p>LORD: There were times when he felt that. However, I think, frankly, that we were
                    being a little bit more responsible than he acknowledged. For example, in the
                    May 1971 proposals to the North Vietnamese we briefed the South Vietnamese
                    generally on our goals if not the specific plan. We tried to prepare President
                    Thieu, over time, that we were going to be out of South Vietnam some day. We
                    said that it was in our joint interest if we could negotiate a deal. The South
                    Vietnamese, of course, were suspicious in general of the negotiations,
                    particularly those that they weren't involved in. They were only being debriefed
                    afterwards on what we had already said. They were more and more suspicious of
                    Kissinger himself. They were afraid that he was more flexible than he indicated
                    and was more eager to have a settlement with the North Vietnamese than President
                    Nixon was. This came to a head, and I'll get to it, in October 1972. There would
                    be times when the South Vietnamese would caution us, but there was never a
                    crisis until that October.</p>
                <p>Q: When you mentioned who was on the North Vietnamese delegation to the secret
                    talks, was there ever any question about having the Viet Cong represented?</p>
                <p>LORD: No. The North Vietnamese just made the point that the Viet Cong were not a
                    part of their delegation. This fiction that the Viet Cong consisted of
                    indigenous South Vietnamese, engaged in a civil war in which the Viet Cong were
                    key players, was total nonsense. The Viet Cong were controlled by the North
                    Vietnamese. It is true that, after the war, there might be some tension between
                    the southern Vietnamese who had been active in the Viet Cong and North
                    Vietnamese officials. However, essentially, North Vietnam was totally running
                    the show. You could argue, based on one reading of the [Geneva] agreement [of
                    1954], that they had a right to elections, which should have been held [in
                    1956]. Saying that this was an indigenous uprising by the Viet Cong is
                    unconvincing. The Viet Cong just didn't have enough support in South
                    Vietnam.Basically, the North Vietnamese were telling the Viet Cong what to do.
                    They made a joke of the conflict being an indigenous, southern revolt. If you
                    accept that, under the Geneva Accord, there should have been elections [for the
                    reunification of Vietnam], it still was partly a civil war as well as invasion.
                    But no one could make the case that it was only a matter of southern Vietnamese
                    against other, southern Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>It is conceivable, although I don't know, that the Viet Cong were more hawkish
                    than Hanoi was on negotiations. We know that Hanoi was far from dovish, very
                    tough. It is conceivable that the Viet Cong would be even more hawkish than
                    North Vietnam. I just don't know to what extent the Viet Cong were fully aware
                    of and informed on the negotiations process.</p>
                <p>Of course, when we got towards the final signing and negotiations [of the Paris]
                    Agreement on Vietnam [of 1973] and how we dealt with the South Vietnamese and
                    the Viet Cong, it became very complicated - as it had been in 1968 - as to who
                    was signing what. Just like the shape of the table [at the public negotiations
                    in Paris] was very complicated. This was essentially the same issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0268" n="Page0268"/>
                <p>We've talked about the summer of 1971 when we had at least some optimism that we
                    were going to make progress. This proved premature. Then, for reasons which I
                    can't recall but which I think primarily involved the fact that we were not
                    making progress by the end of 1971, that Hanoi was stonewalling, there was a
                    feeling that we had to shore up domestic and international support for the war.
                    We also felt that North Vietnam was playing this game of looking reasonable in
                    public and intransigent in the secret talks. We wanted to set the record
                    straight on our efforts to negotiate and on the 'reasonable' substances of our
                    proposals.XI. NSC - INDOCHINA, PEACE AGREEMENT (1972-1973)</p>
                <p>As we headed toward January, 1972, we gradually came to the conclusion that it
                    was important for the President to make a major, public address, again on
                    Vietnam. In the speech he would outline our strategy and goals, recalling
                    Vietnamization and reviewing the progress made to date in terms of declining
                    American casualties and troop levels in Vietnam. Above all, he would reveal the
                    fact that we had made a reasonable offer to North Vietnam and that for some time
                    we had been conducting secret negotiations with them. It was up to Hanoi to
                    respond in a meaningful way.</p>
                <p>I believe that, toward the end of 1971, we fleshed out further the five more
                    proposals made in May, 1971. In fact, I am sure that we did. We held secret
                    meetings in June, July, August, and September, 1971. I believe we took the bare
                    bones of this proposal and added new details to make clear what a military
                    solution only would look like. By January, 1972, it was decided to go public on
                    the heretofore secret negotiations, because Hanoi was not moving, and we were
                    being criticized too much at home in the U.S., as well as elsewhere in the
                    world.</p>
                <p>So there was a Nixon speech on January 25, 1972. Like all of these speeches, I
                    worked hard on the drafting of it. Of course, the speech writers turned it into
                    much better English, while I worked on the substance of it. In this case I
                    believe that John Negroponte also worked on it.</p>
                <p>In this speech we laid out the fact that we had had secret negotiations with
                    North Vietnam and what the substance of our approach had been. In a way it was
                    forthcoming to Hanoi. It was a conciliatory speech, in fact saying that we had
                    made certain proposals, to which Hanoi hadn't responded. Clearly, the speech was
                    aimed at our friends around the world who were concerned about American
                    involvement in Vietnam and, above all, at American public opinion, Congress, and
                    the American media, to shore up our support. It succeeded in doing so, at least
                    for a while. There was a very favorable reaction, both to the substance of the
                    proposal and to the fact that we had conducted secret negotiations, which had
                    not worked until then. We had made a good faith effort at negotiations. There
                    were some, of course, who were critical, and other critics who said that it
                    wasn't a good enough proposal. Some observers said that this was a ploy to shore
                    up domestic opinion. There were also some hawks who felt that we had perhaps
                    gone too far, although there weren't many of these.</p>
                <pb facs="0269" n="Page0269"/>
                <p>I think that there was a large body of opinion which felt that this show of
                    reasonableness went further than we had any reputation for. They felt that if
                    this wasn't a basis for a final settlement, it ought to be enough to get the
                    process going, and Hanoi should respond. So it really did shore up our position
                    in the eyes of public opinion. We revealed that we had been much more flexible
                    in private than in public, and indeed had been more forthcoming than some of our
                    critics had proposed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had we informed the North Vietnamese in advance that we
                        were gointo do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: We did, just in advance. We didn't want to give them too much warning
                    because they might leak the story and pre-empt us. I think that at the last
                    minute before the speech was given, we told the North Vietnamese that they
                    hadn't responded privately to our proposals. In fact, I suspect that we told
                    them at the very last minute. I know that we didn't tell them well in advance,
                    because we thought that they would rush out and leak the story, spinning it
                    their way.</p>
                <p>So on the whole I was pleased with the results of the speech. It showed a good
                    faith effort to end the war. On a personal level my friends could see what we
                    had been doing. The down side was that the North Vietnamese, who were so tough
                    and cynical, anyway, would be upset that we had revealed the negotiations and
                    that this might undercut them with their own friends, the Viet Cong, and
                    embarrass the hard liners in the Politburo. They might also conclude that it was
                    showing bad faith to reveal these secret negotiations and would put them in a
                    spot. As a result, they might dig in their heels and, as a result, become even
                    more intransigent. That was the down side. In fact, secret negotiations are kept
                    secret so that each side can speak more frankly, so that you can hope to make
                    progress. We risked that advantage by going public regarding the fact of the
                    secret negotiations. But we weren't making progress in the secret talks after
                    more than two years. Hanoi had not responded to our flexible proposals, and we
                    hadn't met since September.</p>
                <p>I know that I felt, and this was a pretty unanimous view, including President
                    Nixon, that it was important to set the record straight and to say that we were
                    not making progress because of Hanoi's intransigence. Maybe this would embarrass
                    Hanoi enough or rally international opinion and certainly shore up American
                    support, so that we'd be in a stronger position to carry on. The speech also
                    made clear how far we'd come on Vietnamization and the progress we were making
                    in this regard. A final reason, I'm sure, in terms of the timing of the speech,
                    now that I think of it, was that the speech was going to be delivered a month
                    before the President's trip to China, followed by a summit meeting in Moscow
                    with the Soviet leaders. So I think that the President also wanted to get his
                    views on the Vietnam negotiations on record, as he headed toward China. The
                    dates of the China trip had already been made public, and Deputy National
                    Security Adviser Al Haig had already been to China. This speech not only had an
                    effect on domestic public opinion but also, presumably, it helped us in dealing
                    with the Chinese. So there were a lot of reasons for giving this speech, and it
                    was a good thing to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0270" n="Page0270"/>
                <p>So the Nixon speech of January 25, 1972, was an important one. The next important
                    events were the President's trip to China in February 1972, and his trip to
                    Moscow in May 1972. In terms of Hanoi's bilateral relationships with its friends
                    we hoped that this would increase their sense of isolation and make them more
                    reasonable.</p>
                <p>The next important period in Vietnam at that time was April 1972. The North
                    Vietnamese launched a major offensive against South Vietnam. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that the President had a major decision to
                        make.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: The President had a major decision to make. He was scheduled to go to
                    Moscow in a couple of weeks. The issue was how to respond to this major attack
                    by North Vietnam on South Vietnam.</p>
                <p>First of all, this offensive was having some impact south of the DMZ
                    [Demilitarized Zone along the 17th parallel of latitude] and in the northern
                    part of South Vietnam, in terms of the military balance. The North Vietnamese
                    were making some real inroads. So there was a military question as to whether
                    this was really a danger to our overall goals in South Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Secondly, the offensive showed that they not only were not responding to our
                    offers, which we had revealed publicly, but the North Vietnamese were instead
                    stepping up their military attacks. This was just the opposite of being
                    reasonable.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, and this was very much in President Nixon's mind, they were stepping up
                    the attacks on American and South Vietnamese troops with conventional North
                    Vietnamese forces, which were blatantly crossing the border [on the 17th
                    parallel] and so on. They were doing this at a time when the President was about
                    to go to Moscow, which was providing aid to the North Vietnamese. So, in terms
                    of psychology, domestic public opinion, and credibility, the President was very
                    concerned about being in Moscow in May 1972, at a time when American troops were
                    being killed with Russian weapons provided to the North Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>So the military balance with Hanoi and Hanoi's psychology in taking advantage of
                    us by attacking and not responding in the negotiations were serious
                    considerations. But, above all, Nixon envisioned talking to the Russians and
                    clinking champagne glasses while the Russians were providing military materiel
                    to the North Vietnamese who were killing American troops. Thus President Nixon
                    felt that we had to respond vigorously to the North Vietnamese offensive,
                    specifically by bombing targets around Hanoi and mining Haiphong harbor. It
                    would be weak and humiliating not to respond to their attacks. He couldn't go to
                    Moscow in that way.</p>
                <pb facs="0271" n="Page0271"/>
                <p>Counter arguments were advanced by various people, including me, and, to some
                    degree, Kissinger and others. First, all agreed we had to respond to the
                    military threat on the ground. The question was the degree of this response. If
                    we went so far as to bomb around Hanoi and mine Haiphong harbor, Moscow might
                    call off the summit meeting. I remember that there was a meeting in the White
                    House Situation Room, chaired by Kissinger, probably with representatives from
                    CIA, DIA, and from the State and Defense Departments, the NSC, and others. The
                    purpose of the meeting was to judge what the Russian reaction would be to a
                    major escalation, or counter-escalation by us. I believe that, perhaps with one
                    or two exceptions, everybody at that meeting felt that if we bombed around Hanoi
                    and mined Haiphong harbor, we would lose the forthcoming Summit Meeting with the
                    Russians. The general feeling was that the Russians would cancel the
                    meeting.</p>
                <p>We had made major progress with the Soviets, and we can talk about this later.
                    The fact of the opening to China made the Russians more reasonable on the issues
                    of arms control, Berlin, economic relations, and so forth. So we were heading
                    for a Summit Meeting which was set up with a lot of major agreements close to
                    conclusion, including those affecting SALT [Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty,
                    then in the process of negotiation], arms control, and many other aspects of
                    Soviet-American relations, not to mention the double header of the Summit
                    Meetings in China and in Russia. So we had a lot invested emotionally,
                    intellectually, substantively, and politically looking toward this major advance
                    in relations with the Russians. This had been one of our objectives for several
                    years. Our positions were well established and well prepared. All of this now
                    threatened to go down the tubes at the last minute, because of the proposed
                    bombing of Hanoi and the mining of Haiphong harbor.</p>
                <p>To his credit, in my view, President Nixon's position was firm and correct. First
                    of all, as I said, he couldn't afford to look so weak, and he would do less well
                    with the Russians if he went to Moscow and didn't respond vigorously to their
                    North Vietnamese ally attacking us with Russian arms. He might be regarded as a
                    wimp by the Russians as well as Americans and the world, if he was in Moscow
                    while American soldiers were getting killed with Soviet-made weapons and we were
                    not responding. Secondly, and this is what distinguished Nixon from everybody
                    else, and certainly Kissinger, he boldly predicted that the Russians would not
                    cancel the Summit Meeting. He believed the Russians would go ahead anyway and
                    let the President go to Moscow, looking strong and reacting strongly against the
                    North Vietnamese attacks. He would gain the grudging respect of the Russians and
                    wouldn't lose all of the benefits of the Summit Meeting in the fields of arms
                    control and everything else. So he could have his cake and eat it, too, as the
                    popular saying goes. Even if the Russians canceled the meeting, Nixon felt that
                    it was better not to go to Moscow in view of our goals in Vietnam and
                    international credibility. The worst outcome would be to go to Moscow and not do
                    anything vis-a-vis North Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0272" n="Page0272"/>
                <p>Nixon proved to be prescient, just as he proved that those who were concerned
                    about losing the Summit Meeting were wrong. On this issue Kissinger has to speak
                    for himself. I suspect that Kissinger understood the need for the President to
                    appear to be vigorous in his response on this issue. I also know that Kissinger
                    felt that we might lose the Summit Meeting in Moscow, and he and I agonized over
                    this. Therefore, I think, Kissinger was truly ambivalent on how to deal with
                    this matter. I think that, on balance, he didn't want us to go as far as we did
                    militarily but I don't want to speak for him. Surely he credits Nixon in
                    retrospect for his courageous prescience.</p>
                <p>I myself was opposed to the escalation of the air war against North Vietnam,
                    partly because of my moderately dovish stance on carrying the war to North
                    Vietnam. I felt that, above all, we shouldn't lose all of the advantages which
                    we had gained in terms of relations with the Russians - arms control, Berlin,
                    etc. So I was unhappy with this escalation in the air war against North Vietnam.
                    In this respect, I was probably wrong. I was certainly wrong in terms of my
                    estimate of what the Russians would do.</p>
                <p>Q: Was the argument made that, since we had made this breakthrough to China, the
                    Russians, that is to say, the Soviets were concerned with our gaining an
                    advantage with the Chinese if the Soviets got huffy in their relations with the
                    U.S.? Almost inadvertently, we were playing the China card.</p>
                <p>LORD: A very good point. I'm sure that that's one of the arguments that Nixon
                    made, that the Russians had a stake in this Summit Meeting as well and that they
                    couldn't afford to be one-upped by the Chinese. Fortunately, we had already had
                    our Summit Meeting with the Chinese. I don't know what China would have done in
                    the same situation. They might have canceled the Summit Meeting. However, this
                    happened after the Summit Meeting between the U.S. and China. Nixon felt that we
                    wouldn't have any respect from the Russians if he went to Moscow looking like a
                    wimp in the face of this North Vietnamese offensive, using Russian arms.</p>
                <p>These were Nixon's arguments, including the China dimension, and they showed his
                    really firm, geopolitical grasp of the situation. I still recall flying up to
                    Camp David on a beautiful spring day [Presidential retreat in northern Maryland,
                    near the Pennsylvania border] with Kissinger in a helicopter to work with one of
                    President Nixon's speechwriters on the speech announcing the bombing of Hanoi
                    and the mining of Haiphong harbor. I was very depressed. Both of us were saying:
                    “All of this effort with the Russians is going to go down the drain.” It was a
                    dramatic moment.</p>
                <pb facs="0273" n="Page0273"/>
                <p>So we were able to roll back the North Vietnamese offensive, and the Russians
                    went ahead with the Summit Meeting in Moscow. However, we didn't make any
                    progress in negotiations with the North Vietnamese over the next few months. We
                    had several more meetings with them in 1972 in July, August, and mid-September.
                    We then had one in late September where, for the first time, although we knew
                    that we had been overly optimistic before, we felt that the North Vietnamese had
                    indicated that maybe they might become more flexible. I distinctly remember that
                    it wasn't a breakthrough, but clearly their tone was changing. Then we had the
                    breakthrough in October. Let me explain why this happened.</p>
                <p>The North Vietnamese had just been hanging in there with their intransigent,
                    revolutionary position, as I've said. They weren't about to be flexible, anyway,
                    but they had an added incentive to be intransigent in the summer of 1972. By
                    then our presidential election was coming up. At some point during that summer
                    Senator McGovern got the Democratic Party nomination and was offering a deal way
                    beyond what the Nixon administration was prepared to offer. That is, he was
                    offering support for a coalition government to be established in Saigon, as well
                    as a unilateral U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam.</p>
                <p>During the summer of 1972, even though Hanoi didn't know how the election would
                    come out, the polls showed Nixon quite far ahead. The North Vietnamese probably
                    did their own wishful thinking and felt that McGovern could still win. This
                    meant first, that Hanoi should avoid giving Nixon any sign of progress in the
                    negotiations with the U.S., which might help get him reelected. Secondly, in the
                    hope that McGovern would win the North Vietnamese would get free concessions
                    from McGovern in terms of what Hanoi wanted politically, as well as militarily.
                    In short, they could just wait for McGovern to pull the U.S. out of Vietnam and
                    hand over the Saigon government to Hanoi. McGovern was essentially saying, I
                    want the prisoners back and the North Vietnamese can have everything else. So
                    there was no movement in the negotiations with the North Vietnamese during the
                    summer of 1972.</p>
                <p>By September 1972, the polls were very clear. Partly due to a spectacular record
                    in foreign policy, Nixon was way ahead. Due to the combination of the fact that
                    President Nixon had gone to China and Russia, plus his January 1972 speech on
                    negotiations with North Vietnam, which had helped us shore up support for the
                    Vietnam War, and other reasons, Nixon was in a strong position. McGovern was a
                    very extreme liberal. This wasn't a centrist Democratic challenge to the
                    President. It was a very liberal challenge to him. Even with all other factors
                    balanced in, there was still a silent majority of people who supported the
                    Vietnam War, plus many others who felt that we should try to end it but felt
                    that McGovern was just totally capitulating to the North Vietnamese.
                    Furthermore, McGovern was attacking American motives, plus everything else. He
                    was preaching isolationism and American guilt, so for a variety of reasons,
                    President Nixon was way ahead in the polls.</p>
                <pb facs="0274" n="Page0274"/>
                <p>By September 1972, even the North Vietnamese, for all of their wishful thinking,
                    began to realize that they were probably going to face Nixon for another four
                    years. Then, by October 1972, this perspective became more concrete in our
                    talks. In September the change in the North Vietnamese attitude had been a kind
                    of mood music. In October 1972, the North Vietnamese presented a specific
                    proposal to us. It was raised on October 8.</p>
                <p>So we went over to Paris for this October meeting. By now the North Vietnamese
                    calculation was as follows. First of all, Nixon was likely to be more flexible
                    during the remaining weeks before the election in November. Even though Nixon
                    had an apparent victory in hand, he would want to increase his mandate and make
                    sure he won by looking as if he was negotiating a settlement in Vietnam. So the
                    North Vietnamese figured that Nixon would be at his most conciliatory and would
                    be prepared to make some further concessions on the home stretch in the
                    elections campaign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By now these meetings were being announced publicly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: They were being announced afterwards, immediately after conclusion, but not
                    in advance. Secondly, the North Vietnamese figured that if Nixon was going to
                    win, he would no longer have to worry about being reelected. He had a new
                    mandate for four years. The North Vietnamese had already concluded that he was a
                    madman at times, e.g. by bombing Hanoi and mining the harbor at Haiphong [in May
                    1972]. God knows what he would do when he was free of worrying about public
                    opinion and reelection. Of course, we tried to encourage the North Vietnamese to
                    worry about Nixon being a madman. So the North Vietnamese probably felt that
                    they had better lock this up now, since they weren't going to get McGovern. They
                    were going to get a potential madman for another four years.</p>
                <p>So this was the reason, and the only reason, why the North Vietnamese suddenly
                    became more reasonable. They were not being defeated on the battlefield. The
                    overall situation was still very much a stalemate. The Vietnamization program
                    was proceeding. However, the North Vietnamese evidently felt that they could get
                    a good deal, Nixon would be eager for a settlement, and they would avoid having
                    to face Nixon as a mad man in his second term.</p>
                <pb facs="0275" n="Page0275"/>
                <p>We went over to Paris for this meeting in October 1972, and were given a present
                    by Le Duc Tho. We still had a lot of work to do on it, but basically, it was the
                    break that we were looking for. It incorporated the unilateral withdrawal of
                    U.S. forces and the release of our prisoners, on the military side. The language
                    of the proposal was fairly specific in this respect. The North Vietnamese
                    proposal also included a cease-fire in place and international supervision of
                    the agreement. The North Vietnamese had moved away from their insistence on a
                    coalition government. There still was some tough negotiating, but they used some
                    new language. They proposed a national reconciliation arrangement, but, in
                    effect, they would leave President Thieu in power in Saigon. So the North
                    Vietnamese dropped the political demands that they had stuck with for years.
                    From my point of view, not to mention Nixon and Kissinger, these demands were
                    something that we shouldn't compromise on.</p>
                <p>We received this North Vietnamese proposal at the opening session. Kissinger
                    called for a break in the meeting. I still remember walking with him on a Sunday
                    afternoon in a garden, somewhere in the Paris suburbs. We said to each other:
                    “This is it. We've done it.” We knew that we had a lot of tough slogging ahead
                    with the North Vietnamese. Then, of course, we had to get South Vietnamese
                    agreement. However, essentially, the North Vietnamese had dropped their
                    political demands and were willing to have a military settlement only, even
                    though there was a lot of fudgy language about it.</p>
                <p>This was a very exciting moment. We continued the negotiations for several more
                    days. We reported home to President Nixon, of course. We didn't want to get
                    Washington's hopes up unnecessarily. So we said that we had made some major
                    progress, though we didn't claim that we were home free. We began to alert the
                    South Vietnamese but again avoided overly exciting them. We said that we had
                    made some progress and were going to continue the negotiations. We had to reply
                    to the North Vietnamese with a counter-proposal the next day. Kissinger had me
                    and John Negroponte take the North Vietnamese draft and then change it, within
                    reason, to meet them part way and keep the negotiations going but also address
                    our remaining concerns.</p>
                <p>That night, and I believe that it was the night of October 8, 1972, Negroponte
                    and I took the draft. We worked all night until 3:00 AM. Kissinger had gone out
                    for dinner. He came back, looked at the draft, woke us up at 8:00 AM [on October
                    9] and said that our draft was too tough. He felt that we had put too many more
                    demands back in and that we hadn't been flexible enough for Hanoi to accept. He
                    gave us some instructions on how to loosen up the draft somewhat. Some of them
                    affected the tone, and some affected the substance of the re-draft but of course
                    Kissinger remained firm on the key points. This was a concrete settlement. It
                    was not just a proposal. It contained the actual points of a settlement. So we
                    were instructed to make it a little more forthcoming, both in substance as well
                    as tone. I don't recall all of the details. By noon on October 9 we had a
                    re-draft, which Kissinger accepted.</p>
                <pb facs="0276" n="Page0276"/>
                <p>We went back to the North Vietnamese. We had several days of further
                    negotiations, until October 11, trying to improve the draft, generally keeping
                    Washington and Saigon informed. The last day ran for 14 hours straight. As usual
                    we were preparing verbatim transcripts. I couldn't even go to the bathroom when
                    I wanted to, and I had plenty of coffee to keep me going. After Kissinger had
                    made a presentation, I would have taken the notes and, perhaps, be a sentence or
                    two behind him. Then I would catch up when the interpreters started reading the
                    Vietnamese translation. I would have some time while the interpreters were
                    putting Kissinger's statement into Vietnamese and then more time as the North
                    Vietnamese would respond to the Kissinger statement in Vietnamese which I
                    couldn't do anything about, anyway. I had some more time while the North
                    Vietnamese were speaking before it was translated into English for us. So I had
                    a double header of a break in that context. I would wait for a particularly long
                    Kissinger statement, complete the verbatim notes on what he said, and then race
                    out of the room, go to the bathroom, and get back in time, between the
                    translation into Vietnamese and the translation into English of what the North
                    Vietnamese said in reply.</p>
                <p>We were really very tired, throughout this period. There were problems, for
                    example, with getting the specific details of when we would get our POWs
                    [Prisoners of War] back and details of proposals on Laos and Cambodia as well as
                    Vietnam. The North Vietnamese would claim that they didn't have control over
                    their friends [North Vietnamese allies in Laos and Cambodia]. It is possible
                    that this posture, in fact, was true, particularly with regard to Cambodia,
                    although less so in the case of Laos. We had to make sure that we got our
                    prisoners back from Laos and Cambodia, and we were trying to get the communist
                    side to withdraw its troops from there and to have a cease-fire extended there.
                    So that was a problem. Another problem was allowing military aid to both sides
                    to continue after a cease-fire. Then there were the details of the international
                    supervisory system and what the status of the DMZ [Demilitarized Zone] was. This
                    was the actual dividing line between North and South Vietnam. There were still a
                    lot of details to handle, and a lot of tough questions to be resolved, but the
                    basic breakthrough had been achieved. The North Vietnamese no longer insisted on
                    a coalition government. The language of the draft made it clear that President
                    Thieu would remain in power, while suggesting that there could be a negotiation
                    perhaps leading toward a government of national reconciliation. We tried to make
                    that as vague and as meaningless as possible. In fact, the object was to keep
                    the Saigon Government in power.</p>
                <pb facs="0277" n="Page0277"/>
                <p>We basically put together a draft agreement. Meanwhile, during this period Hanoi
                    was pressing Kissinger to come and visit North Vietnam, as a final, symbolic
                    gesture to make peace and to show, I guess, that we were sort of paying tribute
                    to Hanoi. Not to mention that this made Saigon somewhat nervous. So there was a
                    further question as to whether, after going to Saigon and trying to get
                    President Thieu's agreement to the draft, we would go to North Vietnam as well.
                    Kissinger was willing to dangle this possibility to get the North Vietnamese to
                    be more flexible about the agreement, on the assumption that it was worth doing.
                    There was some disagreement with Washington on whether we ought to go to Hanoi.
                    In addition, we didn't want to be nitpicked by President Nixon and Al Haig
                    [Deputy National Security Adviser] on the details of the agreement. However, we
                    kept Washington generally posted on what we were doing. The same with the Saigon
                    Government, which we also kept posted, to avoid, as I say, getting their
                    paranoia into overdrive.</p>
                <p>The final day of these negotiations was October 11, 1972. So there were four days
                    of negotiations, but one of these days went for 14 hours straight. Kissinger
                    prepared to go back and report to President Nixon. We had a draft agreement
                    initially agreed, but with some outstanding issues of a secondary nature
                    remaining to be resolved. There were also some technical questions of what
                    specific phrases meant, and so on. So this was an exhausting period of several
                    days, including all night sessions of redrafting, checking, sending cables,
                    reporting, and filling in Saigon and Washington, as well as preparing talking
                    points for the next day. We also had to prepare new proposals, in addition to
                    verbatim note taking and so on.</p>
                <p>I was left behind in Paris with FSO [Foreign Service Officer] Dave Engle, who by
                    then had been involved in the negotiations as our top Vietnamese speaker in the
                    Foreign Service. He and I were left behind to have technical talks with the
                    North Vietnamese to clear up some of these sub-issues. So we sat down with the
                    North Vietnamese at the next meeting. I don't remember the details except I was
                    both exhilarated and exhausted. Kissinger took off for Washington, and a few
                    hours later we met with the North Vietnamese. It was quite dramatic at my young
                    age to be directly negotiating the document (albeit minor issues) which could
                    end our longest war.</p>
                <p>Dave Engle and I then had to negotiate with the North Vietnamese at our level on
                    the agreement and settle some of the details on the language. We tried to push
                    them in some respects on some of these issues and clarify the meaning on other
                    issues. Engle would have to check out the Vietnamese language on some of the
                    questions. That was a rather challenging experience for me, actually to be
                    negotiating with the North Vietnamese myself. Again, this was pretty heady stuff
                    for someone like me in his early 30s, negotiating the text to end the war in
                    Vietnam. Even though the basic negotiation had been handled by Kissinger, and
                    this was more technical, still I felt a sense that, though I was exhausted, I
                    was doing something extremely historic and very important.</p>
                <pb facs="0278" n="Page0278"/>
                <p>We worked for about 10 hours straight, with no sleep. I think that we did a
                    pretty damned good job of getting movement on some of these questions and
                    clarifying other things. So I went to sleep, ready to take off the next morning
                    and come back with this annotated draft and with the changes made in agreement
                    with the North Vietnamese. I got a phone call from Al Haig or somebody back in
                    Washington, speaking on behalf of Kissinger. I don't remember the details, but I
                    had to go back again to the North Vietnamese, having thought that I had
                    finished, and make some more points with them. I think that we tried to get a
                    couple of more changes. This was one last episode. I was truly exhausted by this
                    time. Then I got on the plane, a commercial flight, of course, going back to
                    Washington with Dave Engle.</p>
                <p>I remember being very emotionally moved by this moment. I felt that we had
                    reached a final settlement at the end of these long, anguished years that had
                    consumed our society. I felt that I had played a crucial role in it and had
                    acted on behalf of Kissinger and the President. I remember going into the
                    plane's bathroom and crying out of a sense of joy and exhaustion. It was a very
                    emotional moment.</p>
                <p>We arrived back in Washington. I went over to see Kissinger and reviewed the
                    changes that we had negotiated with the North Vietnamese. He was quite satisfied
                    with them. We made a report to President Nixon.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, our next step was to go to Saigon and present this wonderful
                    agreement we had negotiated. Dave Engel had been certified as qualified by the
                    Foreign Service in the Vietnamese language. We had confidence in his ability to
                    check out the translation into Vietnamese. I don't recall whether we had anybody
                    else check it, because the text was so closely held, until we got to a more
                    public stage. What we had was a text which had been negotiated by Kissinger,
                    with some technical and secondary issues of judgment handled by myself with the
                    North Vietnamese. However, there were still some loose ends. These were
                    significant details. I am sure that these included Laos, Cambodia, the DMZ, and
                    some other issues. We were still not entirely satisfied, but the basic issues
                    had been solved and we thought that we now had a rough agreement, in draft, and
                    ad referendum [subject to subsequent confirmation] by Hanoi's Politburo and our
                    President. Of course, we made it clear to the North Vietnamese that we would
                    have to sell this draft to our ally in South Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Before we went to Saigon to review the agreement with President Thieu we sent a
                    cable ahead to foreshadow to some extent that we had something. I forget the
                    term we used, but we said that it represented a breakthrough, a possible
                    agreement, or something like that. We clearly let Thieu know, through Ambassador
                    Bunker, that we were coming to discuss this draft with him. So off we went to
                    Saigon in mid-October 1972. I know that it was mid-October because we were there
                    during my son's birthday celebration, which is October 19. I was always away
                    from home for his birthday. It seemed that there was always something going on
                    in Vietnam, China, or somewhere. I would write him a letter on his birthday (he
                    was five in 1972).</p>
                <pb facs="0279" n="Page0279"/>
                <p>On the way over to Saigon, of course, we continued to refine the draft talking
                    points that we had prepared for the discussions with the South Vietnamese, the
                    texts of the agreements, the rationale for each of the points, the defense
                    against what we knew would be Thieu's likely objections, and so forth. Kissinger
                    and I were relatively optimistic about this meeting with President Thieu,
                    although we knew that he would huff and puff. We thought that he would accept
                    the agreement, because we had eliminated the political elements, the call for
                    his resignation, for a coalition government, etc. John Negroponte was very
                    skeptical on Thieu's reaction, more pessimistic. Among other factors was the
                    fact that North Vietnamese troops would remain in South Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we getting from Ambassador Bunker? He was the
                        man othe scene and had been there since 1957.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I know that Ambassador Bunker felt that we had negotiated a good
                    settlement. I don't recall his predicting President Thieu's response, one way or
                    the other. Of course, Bunker himself didn't know enough about the agreement. He
                    was smart enough to know that we were rounding off the edges, so Thieu wouldn't
                    get too excited. Bunker didn't have enough to go on to predict Thieu's response.
                    I'm sure that Ambassador Bunker sent a cable in advance, stating President
                    Thieu's main concerns, based on what he knew about the agreement. That was his
                    line. I don't believe that he predicted what President Thieu's response would
                    be. I definitely recall in particular that John Negroponte was less happy about
                    the agreement than Kissinger and I were. Indeed, Negroponte was very uneasy and
                    unhappy. He wasn't a mindless hawk, he understood the pressures on the
                    President, and he knew that this was a better deal than the New York Times and
                    other papers were calling for. He knew that this was probably the best deal that
                    we could get, based on the realities on the ground and the realities of
                    Congressional and domestic support, which were still fading. For all these
                    reasons, Kissinger and I were much happier with the agreement than John.
                    Anything substantially better was unrealistic. We had long ago crossed the
                    bridge of giving up on mutual withdrawals. So on the substance of the agreement,
                    Kissinger and I were right, I believe, and John unrealistic about getting a
                    better deal.</p>
                <p>John felt that there were some real problems, particularly allowing North
                    Vietnamese troops to stay in South Vietnam, although we had been following that
                    approach since at least May 1971. Negroponte felt that Thieu would have a real
                    problem with the agreement, primarily with the U.S. withdrawing its forces and
                    the North Vietnamese remaining in South Vietnam.</p>
                <p>We were more optimistic because until this moment the North Vietnamese had been
                    pressing publicly and privately, and President Thieu knew this, for us to get
                    rid of Thieu and for us to put in a coalition government. At one point they had
                    even suggested our eliminating Thieu. At a minimum, Hanoi had insisted on a
                    coalition government, even if it included Thieu or one of his deputies. This
                    would sooner or later unravel the situation in Saigon.</p>
                <pb facs="0280" n="Page0280"/>
                <p>Thieu felt that the continued presence of North Vietnamese in South Vietnam would
                    be subversive and that the result would be that the North Vietnamese would take
                    over the country. We felt that after several years of hanging tough, getting
                    Hanoi to drop its political demands, and leaving President Thieu in power would
                    satisfy him. In addition, the agreement had provisions for continuing economic
                    and military assistance to South Vietnam, as well as getting our prisoners back,
                    a cease-fire, and so on. The draft agreement provided for some international
                    supervision, although that was always going to be tough. The agreement also made
                    provision for getting South Vietnamese prisoners back. We knew that Thieu
                    wouldn't like allowing North Vietnamese troops to stay in his country. However,
                    we thought that the fact that he would stay in power and would continue to get
                    support from us, that no further infiltration of North Vietnamese forces would
                    be allowed, and that the DMZ was supposed to be monitored so that there would be
                    no more North Vietnamese troops coming into South Vietnam would satisfy him.
                    Over time, the North Vietnamese presence would wither. Moreover we had invested
                    a great deal in strengthening South Vietnam's force, and we had made huge human,
                    financial, and political sacrifices in his defense.</p>
                <p>The agreement also provided for equipment replacement on a one for one basis. You
                    couldn't build up, increase equipment supplies on either side. For example, if
                    the North Vietnamese fired a round of artillery, they could bring in another
                    round, to take a silly example. At the time, we felt that the situation was
                    sufficiently policed that the North Vietnamese forces would suffer from
                    attrition and that the South Vietnamese could handle this. I'll get back to this
                    later on. So we believed that the fact that North Vietnamese troops would remain
                    in South Vietnam would be outweighed by the fact that we had solved the
                    political problems. Thieu could stay in power and would get a lot of American
                    aid.</p>
                <p>Q: The North Vietnamese troops would be out in the jungle, in the hinterland,
                    while the South Vietnamese troops would be around the cities and would be under
                    much better conditions.</p>
                <p>LORD: That's correct. Absolutely. But it turned out that Negroponte was more
                    prescient than we were in terms of Thieu's reaction to the draft agreement.</p>
                <pb facs="0281" n="Page0281"/>
                <p>We arrived in Saigon. We went to President Thieu's office, and Kissinger made the
                    presentation about why it was in the South Vietnamese interest to accept the
                    agreement and that we would back them up. In case there were any violations,
                    President Nixon would react strongly. Thieu could count on us to enforce the
                    agreement. Kissinger said that this was the best deal that we could get, based
                    on the level of American domestic support. We had done our duty by South
                    Vietnam. We had hung tough in the negotiations and kept Thieu in power. He had
                    gotten a lot of economic and military aid from us. We would rush extra aid into
                    South Vietnam before the agreement was signed, so that he would be in the
                    strongest position possible, before the provisions of the agreement entered into
                    effect. This effort was called Project ENHANCE, or something like that. We said
                    that we would resume bombing if the North Vietnamese attacked in violation of
                    the agreement. We said that we would give South Vietnam full diplomatic support
                    as well as military and economic aid. We said that we were working on the
                    Chinese and the Russians to isolate Hanoi and try to get them to cut off aid to
                    the North Vietnamese, if possible, and that this was clearly our intention.</p>
                <p>There was also the whole aid dimension, where we had agreed with the North
                    Vietnamese that we would help them with the reconstruction of their country. We
                    wouldn't call this assistance reparations, as they wanted to call it. We would
                    also give a lot of aid to our friends in Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam. I
                    think that it involved $2.5 billion for the South Vietnamese. So for all of
                    these reasons, while we didn't think that it would be easy to persuade President
                    Thieu to accept the agreement with the North Vietnamese, we thought that he
                    would buy, despite grumbling. As I said, John Negroponte was suspicious about
                    this.</p>
                <p>When President Thieu first heard our presentation, he didn't react. He just
                    listened. We had no reason to be pessimistic after the initial meeting. I don't
                    recall the sequence, but there was some delay in setting up the next meeting, at
                    which we would have Thieu's response. Whenever the next meeting did take place,
                    we were blasted. Thieu was very upset with the agreement, almost across the
                    board. Above all, because of the continued presence of North Vietnamese troops.
                    He picked out all kinds of other language which he thought was weak, in terms of
                    international supervision, supplies, the amount of aid, or whatever. He
                    complained about virtually everything, but above all the continued presence of
                    North Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Secondly, Thieu said, in effect, that we had misled him. He said that this
                    agreement went way beyond what we had been reporting to him and what he thought
                    was in store for him. Thirdly, in negotiating this agreement, we had been
                    negotiating the fate of South Vietnam. Now, he said, you come to me, a couple of
                    weeks before your elections, and expect me to accept this agreement, which will
                    seal the fate of my country and my countrymen in a couple of days. He said that
                    the agreement was wrong in terms of principle and also wrong in terms of
                    perception, with the Americans ramming this agreement down my throat and not
                    taking into account the fate of the South Vietnamese people.</p>
                <pb facs="0282" n="Page0282"/>
                <p>So, overall, this was a very tough and discouraging session, to say the least. It
                    wasn't a matter of saying that we should go back and fix this up or deal with
                    this or that problem. He essentially rejected the overall agreement. It was not
                    a total formal rejection of the agreement. He said: “We've got to have the
                    following changes.” But he required so many changes, and they were so important,
                    that it was just impossible, to see a solution.</p>
                <p>To say that we were depressed, would be a colossal understatement. I would
                    compare the flap on Laos (the 'White Paper' I wrote in 1970) as an occasion when
                    I was equally depressed. This was certainly another such occasion, though in
                    this case I didn't feel personally responsible. We ended three or four days of
                    very difficult discussions in Saigon. We were reporting back to President Nixon,
                    through Deputy Security Adviser Al Haig, using back channels, which involved
                    double encrypting of the messages. We reported that Thieu was reacting
                    negatively and what he wanted. President Nixon and Haig were already more
                    skeptical of the agreement than we were. They appreciated the breakthrough that
                    we had achieved but they were not quite as enthusiastic about it as Kissinger
                    and his team were, not including Negroponte. Above all, Nixon did not want to
                    have a big split with our ally. After all, it was their country.</p>
                <p>Contrary to Hanoi's view, Nixon was determined not to look as if he were overly
                    eager for a settlement just before the presidential election. He did not want to
                    be accused before history or public opinion of selling out South Vietnam for the
                    sake of being reelected, or making a deal which did not redeem the sacrifices
                    which had been made over many years. He said that this would look political.
                    Moreover, Nixon didn't need this to be reelected. The polls showed him so far
                    ahead of McGovern that he didn't need a successful negotiation of the Vietnam
                    war. So Nixon was determined not to have an agreement on South Vietnam at any
                    price. He thought that that kind of agreement would look opportunistic and would
                    make him look weak to his hard-headed supporters, and others around the world.
                    As I said, he didn't need the agreement for his reelection.</p>
                <p>Nixon was considering that, once he was elected, having beaten McGovern, he would
                    have a mandate, and Hanoi would really be nervous about what this madman Nixon
                    might do. They might be more flexible after the 1972 presidential election.
                    Sure, Nixon would have liked to have an agreement and, if South Vietnam had
                    accepted it, he would have been delighted. However, he certainly didn't want an
                    agreement involving a split with our South Vietnamese allies. He couldn't
                    possibly accept a major split, both in principle, in terms of the agreement
                    standing up, and in terms of public opinion at home concerning selling out our
                    friends, or looking opportunistic before the election.</p>
                <p>So we stayed in Saigon a couple of more days after the initial blowup to try to
                    get President Thieu to be more flexible and to collect his requests. By then we
                    realized that we would have to go back to Hanoi and try to accommodate what
                    Thieu's priority concerns were. They appeared to be so extensive that it was
                    pretty discouraging.</p>
                <pb facs="0283" n="Page0283"/>
                <p>Meanwhile, we were sending cables back to Washington, reporting the results of
                    our conversations with Thieu. It was maddening, because there was a time delay
                    in sending the cables, especially using double encryption. What happened was
                    that I would sit down with Kissinger. He would tell me what he wanted in a
                    cable, reporting to Nixon through Al Haig. He would outline the action which he
                    thought should be taken and the key issues involved. For example, should we go
                    to Hanoi? All of these issues had to be resolved. So we sent this message
                    back.</p>
                <p>We would get responses back from Al Haig, on behalf of the President. By this
                    time Haig was playing games with the President. He was acting for Kissinger at
                    home and was more skeptical about the agreement, anyway. He knew the President
                    was skeptical. This was an opportunity to gain influence with the President at
                    Kissinger's expense. We didn't know how much in the responses reflected the
                    President's views and how much was Haig. Haig's cables were usually quite tough,
                    criticizing us and being very unhappy about the way things were unfolding. There
                    was always a time lag, so we would be responding to a previous cable. And in
                    response to our cable, they would send another response. So we were one cable
                    behind in each direction. There must have been four or five cables like this.
                    What would happen is that we would draft a cable (Kissinger dictating the
                    substance and tone) and send it to Haig in Washington for the President. We
                    would then get to sleep, and one hour later the communications people would wake
                    me up and say that a reply from Haig was coming in. It wouldn't be a response to
                    the one that we had just sent to Haig. It would be a response to a message sent
                    earlier.</p>
                <p>It was maddening. We were very depressed anyway, because of Thieu's reaction. We
                    were nervous as hell about this agreement blowing up. We had President Nixon and
                    Al Haig beating up on us, and we had this communications glitch because of the
                    time difference and the delays occasioned by communications and the double
                    encryption process. We were always one message behind on these things.</p>
                <p>Q: Something you mentioned struck me. What about this relationship with Al Haig?
                    Did you have a feeling that Haig, in a way, was reflecting Nixon or was
                    reflecting something else?</p>
                <pb facs="0284" n="Page0284"/>
                <p>LORD: Well, we couldn't be sure. Certainly, Kissinger was particularly suspicious
                    of Haig, and I tended to hold the view that Haig might even have been egging on
                    President Nixon a little bit. I won't try to explain the President's perception.
                    In a way, his was a principled view. He wasn't going to make a lousy deal before
                    the election, both in terms of justice and in terms of self interest and
                    perception. I think that he didn't want to sell out our friends in South
                    Vietnam. Moreover, he always felt that Kissinger was more eager for a deal in
                    South Vietnam than he, Nixon, was. Haig was certainly more hawkish than
                    Kissinger was. Part of this emerging difference would have reflected the
                    President's reaction, anyway. We were quite sure that Haig was saying, in
                    effect: “Well, Henry Kissinger's done it again. Look at Thieu's reaction. He has
                    a point. Why the hell should we do this? Why don't we get the North Vietnamese
                    to do that? Do we really want this argument with our ally three weeks before the
                    election?”</p>
                <p>So we had the feeling that some of this rhetoric was either a case of Haig having
                    egged on the President and eliciting instructions from him to this effect. Or
                    Haig was interpreting the President's mood and embellishing it in a fairly tough
                    way. These messages were pretty tough, considering that they came out of
                    Washington. We never could sort that out. Haig, of course, was meticulous about
                    saying that he was only relaying the President's views and that he was trying to
                    represent Henry Kissinger to the President and defend him as best he could.
                    Henry didn't think so, and it was a very tense situation.</p>
                <p>We left Saigon with very extensive South Vietnamese demands for changes in the
                    agreement. We had to do a holding action with Hanoi. By this time, of course, it
                    was impossible to go to Hanoi. We could only go there if we could absolutely
                    close the deal. So we had to postpone the trip to Hanoi, and Kissinger said, in
                    effect, to the North Vietnamese: “Well, we told you in Paris that this deal is a
                    good one and we still think that it is. However, we cannot implement this
                    agreement without South Vietnamese acceptance. We will continue to work with our
                    allies and will try to bring them around. However, we're going to have to make
                    some changes. We just can't sell the agreement to the South Vietnamese in this
                    way. We stand by the basic agreement. We think that it's a good agreement. Don't
                    give up. We'll be in touch with you. I can't come to Hanoi now.”</p>
                <p>So we went back to Washington. I don't know how soon this happened, but within a
                    day or two there was a press release out of Hanoi, lambasting the United States,
                    President Nixon, and Kissinger. The statement said that the United States had
                    agreed to a deal with Hanoi and now, under the pretense that it couldn't tell
                    their lackeys in Saigon what to do, the U.S. was now reneging on the
                    arrangements we had made. Hanoi said that we had broken a solemn agreement with
                    Hanoi and also an agreement for Kissinger to visit Hanoi. They then proceeded to
                    publish the entire agreement that we had reached with them. This would have been
                    on about October 25, 1972, give or take a few days. We are talking about perhaps
                    10 days before the election.</p>
                <pb facs="0285" n="Page0285"/>
                <p>This led immediately to Kissinger's first press conference. He had given plenty
                    of backgrounders and so forth. He dealt with the press skillfully and well.
                    However, I don't recall that he had ever given an on the record press
                    conference, standing there with TV cameras on him. I forget what day of the week
                    it was but I recall going into the office and working with him on what he would
                    say and how he would handle questions and what answers he would give. In short,
                    how to handle the press conference.</p>
                <p>This was Kissinger's famous peace is at hand press conference, as you may recall.
                    Basically, he outlined the course of the negotiations. He tried to strike a calm
                    tone with Hanoi. In effect, he was angry with Hanoi because they had leaked the
                    agreement. He tried to keep Hanoi aboard without lowering the whole tone, even
                    though they had blasted us and released the text of the agreement. Essentially,
                    Kissinger confirmed that what Hanoi had released was, in fact, the agreement.
                    However, he pointed out that we had told Hanoi that we could never agree to this
                    deal unless the Saigon Government agreed to it. This was true, but we had been
                    pretty confident that when we got to Saigon, we would obtain the agreement of
                    the South Vietnamese Government. Of course, Hanoi was playing this in the
                    opposite direction, saying that the South Vietnamese Government was just a bunch
                    of U.S. lackeys anyhow and that the U.S. was using this as an excuse.</p>
                <p>In this connection, we tried to be firm with Hanoi, on the one hand, by saying
                    that they were absolutely wrong. We had told them that we didn't have a deal
                    until the Saigon Government agreed with it. We also said that we stood by the
                    essential deal, so we advised Hanoi not to jump off the reservation. With the
                    Saigon Government, even though we were mad at them for rejecting what we thought
                    was in our joint interest, we said that we had been very patient and invested a
                    lot in their defense over the years. We tried not to be too tough on the Saigon
                    Government. We said that we were still going to have a deal with the North
                    Vietnamese, whether the Saigon authorities liked it or not. The basic deal
                    remained. This was the best we could do, and it was in our mutual interest.
                    However, we said that we would try to make some changes and make it more
                    acceptable to the Saigon Government and we would not rush the process.</p>
                <p>Certainly, shortly before an election in the U.S. we were not going to reach an
                    agreement with the North Vietnamese behind the back of the Saigon Government. We
                    couldn't do this anyway, and we would try to make the agreement more acceptable
                    to it. However, the Saigon Government should not think that we're going to have
                    a revolutionary change in the agreement. The basic structure is there now,
                    including, implicitly, the presence of North Vietnamese troops in their
                    country.</p>
                <p>So Kissinger summed up his press statement by saying that it was a good deal. He
                    showed some sympathy for South Vietnam, which was our ally, after all. We could
                    never implement this arrangement without their agreement. He also said that
                    Hanoi was acting in bad faith. We had made progress and we were standing by the
                    basic agreement.</p>
                <pb facs="0286" n="Page0286"/>
                <p>That was the tone he set, speaking to the two audiences in Vietnam, North and
                    South, as well as to the American audience. In the course of it he wanted to
                    show, first, that we were in fact close to an agreement. This was not some
                    cynical ploy by President Nixon to get votes and that there never had been much
                    of an agreement, and it was all PR [public relations]. Secondly, Kissinger
                    wanted to show Hanoi that we were still within range of a settlement. Thirdly,
                    Kissinger also wanted to show Saigon that, whatever their objections - and we
                    were temporarily, by reason of justice and politics, delaying the conclusion of
                    these negotiation- we continued to stick by the essential agreement.</p>
                <p>For all of these reasons Kissinger used the phrase: “Peace is at hand.” What he
                    meant by that is that we didn't have it yet, but this is real progress. To
                    Hanoi, we stick by the essential agreement. We weren't going to bow out of the
                    agreement, but we had to renegotiate some of it. To Saigon he said, in effect,
                    that we appreciate your objections up to a point, but you're going to have to
                    live with this deal. Peace is at hand, Saigon and Hanoi.</p>
                <p>Generally, that is what Kissinger was trying to do. Now, of course, he was
                    immediately criticized, at least in the following week, for exaggerating how
                    close we were to a settlement, in order to ensure the President's reelection.
                    This is exactly what President Nixon wouldn't want done and exactly what
                    Kissinger was not trying to say. I can say that with all sincerity. President
                    Nixon was going to win reelection anyway. Kissinger was trying not only to hold
                    American domestic opinion but to hold Hanoi and Saigon on the reservation. That
                    was Kissinger's purpose, but he was roundly criticized for exaggerating how
                    close peace was, on the eve of the election.</p>
                <p>In fact, the agreement was very close. The deal that we finally did sign a few
                    months later was almost exactly the deal that we had then. So Kissinger was
                    absolutely accurate and was not cynical in his portrayal of the agreement. He
                    was trying to hold the situation together, reassuring Hanoi and warning
                    Saigon.</p>
                <p>So that obviously put us in a holding pattern until after the elections. We got
                    in touch with the North Vietnamese and said that we wanted to resume the
                    negotiations after the November, 1972, elections, in Paris. By now, of course,
                    it was public knowledge when we were going, although the discussions themselves
                    were secret. I don't recall whether Al Haig went out to Saigon, but we spent
                    this time collecting South Vietnamese views again, trying to indicate what we
                    would attempt to get and what we wouldn't attempt to get. Of course, we would
                    try to get most of what the South Vietnamese wanted, but in terms of a lot of
                    that, we would simply go through the motions. We had tried once to get some of
                    these changes and would try harder once again. We wanted some of the changes the
                    South Vietnamese wanted - they were, after all, desirable. And if Thieu wasn't
                    fully satisfied, at least he would have enough of a fig leaf to show his people
                    and say to himself that he had gotten some improvement in the agreement.</p>
                <pb facs="0287" n="Page0287"/>
                <p>There were some aspects that we would like to have improved. However, we had
                    gotten about as far as we could, and further than most thought possible.</p>
                <p>We went over to Paris in November, 1972, after the elections. The Hanoi
                    representatives were very intransigent. After a couple of days of discussions,
                    when we essentially treaded water but didn't make any progress, the North
                    Vietnamese representatives came in and basically tried to unravel the agreement.
                    They began to make some new demands and to take back some of the concessions
                    that they had already made. We said that we were going to blow the whistle and
                    stop. We weren't getting anywhere. So we stopped.</p>
                <p>We had another go-around with the North Vietnamese in Paris in December 1972,
                    with the same lack of results. We were not getting anywhere. In fact, we raised
                    the South Vietnamese points with the North Vietnamese, and there were a few
                    technical points they ceded, but we were not getting anything significant, and
                    Hanoi was making counter-demands.</p>
                <p>During the November and December sessions we stayed at the U.S. embassy. I recall
                    vividly having sensational, three star meals, but being very gloomy.</p>
                <p>As we headed toward the Christmas holidays in 1972, we were at an impasse. We had
                    tried to make clear that we wanted to go essentially with the October agreement
                    but that we needed a few changes, both on the merits and to bring the Saigon
                    Government aboard. But Hanoi was not having any of this.</p>
                <p>To try to prod Hanoi into a more reasonable attitude, as well as for military
                    purposes, President Nixon ordered the so-called “Christmas Bombing,” the heavy
                    bombing of North Vietnam in December, 1972. I think that the bombing actually
                    continued during the Christmas holidays. I wasn't particularly in favor of this,
                    although this is an example of my dovish instincts again. It seemed to me that
                    in the past this kind of attack had not particularly worked, but I have to say
                    that I didn't have any particular alternative to suggest. After all, North
                    Vietnam was digging in. We had essentially a good agreement that South Vietnam
                    wasn't buying.</p>
                <p>So President Nixon ordered the bombing of North Vietnam for two reasons: first,
                    to show Hanoi that we were not desperate and that if they didn't make some
                    changes in the agreement, we would punish them. President Nixon had been
                    reelected overwhelmingly in November 1972, and Hanoi had to worry about his
                    sanity, now that he had a relatively free hand. Secondly, even as we undertook
                    the bombing, we sent Hanoi a message that we still wanted to negotiate, but they
                    hadn't given us any choice except return to military action.</p>
                <pb facs="0288" n="Page0288"/>
                <p>President Nixon was also sending a message to the Saigon Government. He was
                    determined, as Kissinger was, to stick to the original agreement, essentially,
                    as well as to try to get some changes in it. So Nixon was saying in effect to
                    Saigon: “If you buy this agreement, we'll stand behind you. I'm bombing the hell
                    out of Hanoi right now. We can anticipate some disagreements once we conclude
                    the agreement. I'm showing you that I'm willing to bomb Hanoi and North Vietnam.
                    So if you sign this agreement, you can count on my enforcing it.” So the bombing
                    of North Vietnam was not only a signal to North Vietnam to be reasonable but
                    also to South Vietnam to be similarly reasonable and to sign off on the
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>As always, I drafted, with Kissinger's supervision and editing, thmessages.</p>
                <p>Whatever the extent of the bombing of North Vietnam, the objective, of course,
                    was never to cause civilian casualties. In choosing targets, great care was
                    taken to avoid civilian casualties and this was generally done. However, Hanoi,
                    for propaganda reasons, greatly inflated what had been done, and the doves and
                    other people in the United States talked about American atrocities. The fact is
                    that, when we went to Hanoi in February, 1973, the bulk of the bomb craters we
                    saw were in areas which were wholly or relatively unpopulated. I'm sure that
                    there were some civilian casualties, but most of the casualties were military.
                    On the whole, the bombing campaign was carried out as carefully as it could be
                    done.</p>
                <p>The fact is that within days of the beginning of the bombing, we received a
                    conciliatory note from Hanoi, suggesting that we resume negotiations. So this
                    worked out well, and it probably encouraged President Thieu of South Vietnam to
                    think that we would be tough in the negotiations with the North Vietnamese, or
                    at least in enforcing a settlement.</p>
                <p>Whenever I encounter questions about this bombing of North Vietnam, I always
                    point out that it worked. And that there were minimal civilian casualties. I was
                    reluctant to bomb at the time, although I didn't have an alternative. Nor did
                    anyone else. This was a question of means and ends, and Hanoi was not exactly
                    playing by the Marquis of Queensberry rules.</p>
                <p>So, in early January 1973, we resumed negotiations. Things moved quite quickly.
                    The North Vietnamese stopped telling us that certain issues could not be
                    discussed, and stopped introducing new demands, so we weren't going backwards.
                    We reached a few of our objectives of some significance. We made no really major
                    changes in the agreement. The agreement was marginally better in some areas. I
                    believe these included arrangements in the DMZ [Demilitarized Zone around the
                    17th parallel of North latitude], resupply provisions, matters affecting Laos
                    and Cambodia, and arrangements affecting South Vietnamese prisoners. They were
                    issues of that kind.</p>
                <pb facs="0289" n="Page0289"/>
                <p>We were also negotiating technical protocols. Ambassador Bill Sullivan of the
                    State Department, who had also worked on the negotiation of the Geneva Accord
                    [of 1964] with Governor Harriman, worked on technical arrangements affecting
                    Laos and Cambodia, international supervision, and prisoners of war. These were
                    technical details which we put together. George Aldrich from the Office of the
                    Legal Adviser of the State Department was also involved in these negotiations.
                    By now the State Department was more fully involved in the negotiations. We had
                    a good team to deal with the final details, as well as technical matters.</p>
                <p>We concluded the agreement in Paris with the North Vietnamese and initialed it on
                    January 23, 1973. Toasts were exchanged, and there was a feeling of camaraderie
                    all around. There had been too much pain and anguish, but clearly there was a
                    feeling of relief on our part and that of the North Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>We had to get the Saigon Government on board with the revised text, in these
                    final days. We sent Al Haig [Deputy National Security Adviser to President
                    Nixon] to Saigon. There were at least a couple of letters from President Nixon
                    to Nguyen van Thieu [President of the Republic of Vietnam]. These letters were
                    very tough and also very reassuring at the same time. I did the basic drafting,
                    as usual, with Kissinger's direction and Nixon's approval. Basically, they said
                    that we had done all that we could. We told President Thieu that we had gotten
                    whatever we could and that we weren't going to get a better deal. The letters
                    said that President Nixon felt that the revised agreement satisfied the national
                    interests of the United States and of the Republic of Vietnam. The letters said
                    that we would enforce the agreements and would bomb North Vietnam, if necessary,
                    and that the United States would stick by South Vietnam. Furthermore, we would
                    provide economic and military aid to South Vietnam. We pointed out the
                    advantages of the agreement and our willingness to enforce it. President Nixon
                    said, in effect, that we had given the Saigon Government all that we could give
                    it in terms of years of blood and treasure and in terms of the deal. Now was the
                    time for the Saigon Government to come aboard and support the agreement that had
                    been negotiated.</p>
                <p>In effect, the letters were a combination of reassurance, persuasion, and threat.
                    These letters later became somewhat controversial, because Congress felt that
                    President Nixon had promised in them to respond with further bombing to a
                    renewal of North Vietnamese aggression, without consulting Congress. In effect,
                    some members of Congress felt that Nixon had made some secret commitments.</p>
                <pb facs="0290" n="Page0290"/>
                <p>Also, as part of the negotiation, we included the aid program, which was somewhat
                    separate. We were very careful not to promise to make reparations payments to
                    North Vietnam. However, we wanted to offer them some economic incentives. We
                    would call them funds for the reconstruction of Indochina and provide large
                    amounts of money for Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam as well. Here too some in
                    Congress later felt that we had not consulted them sufficiently. But we had been
                    careful to point out in the side agreement that Congress would have to approve
                    any assistance, and that North Vietnam would have to honor the overall
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>Thus, with Saigon's grudging acceptance, we initiated the agreement and returned
                    to Paris for the final signature on January 27, 1973. Kissinger stayed in
                    Washington, and Secretary of State Rogers went to sign the agreement in Paris
                    with the other foreign ministers. I flew with him. There were last-minute
                    negotiations about who would sit where for the signature ceremony. There were
                    protocol arrangements to be resolved at the last minute.</p>
                <p>Secretary of State Rogers signed the text of the agreement for the United States,
                    at the official signature meeting. There were two rows of American officials
                    sitting behind him. I had written most of the agreement, along with John
                    Negroponte, a member of the NSC [National Security Council] staff, and National
                    Security Adviser Henry Kissinger. I had spent three years in the negotiations.
                    But thanks to State protocol, I was sitting the farthest back of the American
                    officials, where you could find State Department people who probably didn't even
                    know where Vietnam was! So this probably reflected State resentment over the
                    secret negotiations and turf battles. I was probably a GS-14 [civil service
                    rank] at the time, so I guess that you could make that argument as well.
                    However, I just felt that I deserved a higher position in the seating. That's
                    human nature. I should have been seated farther toward the front. That's a minor
                    point, but I was, of course, delighted to have been involved in negotiating this
                    agreement and to be present at the ceremony. Indeed I was euphoric.</p>
                <p>On top of the opening to China, the secret trip to China by Kissinger, and then
                    the trip to China by President Nixon, the summit meeting in Moscow and the deals
                    with Moscow on many fronts and, I believe, the beginning of some movement in
                    negotiations on the Middle East, I really felt good about the situation in
                    general for our foreign policy. 1972 had been a truly extraordinary year for
                    America and the world - and the most hectic, dramatic, and successful of my
                    entire career.</p>
                <p>Perhaps I could explain now why we thought that the agreement on Vietnam would
                    work. The next question is what we honestly thought ourselves of the agreement
                    that we had negotiated. Clearly, when you are in the middle of negotiations and
                    working out a deal, you're going to have a higher view of the agreement than an
                    outsider would have, one who didn't have to slug it out. We were not na�ve. We
                    knew that the agreement on Vietnam was not a perfect agreement. Above all, we
                    didn't trust Hanoi. However, we honestly felt a great sense of accomplishment
                    and believed that the deal could work.</p>
                <pb facs="0291" n="Page0291"/>
                <p>I say this particularly because Kissinger has been accused of cynically
                    negotiating a decent interval between the signature of the agreement and its
                    subsequent collapse. When the agreement on Vietnam collapsed a couple of years
                    later, a lot of people on the Left and on the Right said that President Nixon
                    and Kissinger knew that the agreement was going to collapse. These people said
                    that they basically sought some time, perhaps a couple of years, a decent
                    interval, which would make it look like the breakdown of the agreement was South
                    Vietnam's fault and not that of the U.S. Some people, most of them on the
                    political Right in the U.S., felt that the agreement on Vietnam was a phony
                    setup. Those on the Left said that we could have ended the war earlier. If we
                    were going to have a collapse, anyway, why not save lives and reach an agreement
                    with North Vietnam in 1969 or 1970? Both sides were wrong. It was an honest
                    deal. And we could not have achieved it any earlier.</p>
                <p>I can tell you that Kissinger, President Nixon, and I felt that the agreement on
                    Vietnam could work, and there was no thought of a decent interval. People like
                    John Negroponte and Al Haig were more skeptical of it but were not violently
                    against the agreement. No one was sure that it would last, but all thought that
                    it might work especially if the U.S. were firm about compliance. So I want to
                    make clear that there was no thinking about a decent interval going on here to
                    work out a cynical deal which Kissinger and his associates didn't think would
                    hold up.</p>
                <p>Why were we satisfied with this deal which we knew was not perfect? First of all,
                    there is the general principle that the United States had lost a large number of
                    lives and an incredible amount of money, as well as losing concentration on a
                    large number of important issues around the world. We had torn apart our
                    society, domestically, on behalf of an ally, South Vietnam. After a dozen years
                    of this kind of investment, and you can calculate it from 1961, if you wish, we
                    felt that we had really done our duty for a friend. At some point the South
                    Vietnamese were going to have to stand up and defend themselves on their own. We
                    had given them about 12 years of a very large, American investment in lives and
                    material. Certainly, the Vietnamization process had been going on for several
                    years. We had trained, supplied, and built up the South Vietnamese armed forces
                    so that they could take on this burden of defending themselves. There was
                    sharing of responsibility, and we carried this burden gladly, along the lines I
                    just mentioned. Further, there was the Guam Statement and the Nixon Doctrine
                    which stated that countries should be responsible for their own security.</p>
                <pb facs="0292" n="Page0292"/>
                <p>The problem was that time was not on our side. We preferred to reach a deal
                    before the presidential election of 1972, but not for - indeed, in spite of -
                    political reasons. One reason that we might be able to reach a deal with Hanoi
                    was that we knew that they were calculating that President Nixon, whom they
                    considered a madman, would be able to do whatever he wanted to do after the
                    election. We believed that they thought that they had better make a deal now.
                    But we also suspected that this was not the case. We had a better sense of our
                    domestic scene than Hanoi did. We knew that, even if Nixon were reelected,
                    whatever the mood of the American people, who might be the silent majority,
                    Congress was going to restrict us militarily. Far from having a madman to deal
                    with, who could do whatever he wanted, Hanoi would have a Congress which could
                    constrain Nixon by cutting off the bombing of North Vietnam or by cutting off
                    whatever else he wanted to do. Instead of facing a President Nixon who could do
                    whatever he wanted to do, Hanoi eventually came to realize that Nixon would not
                    have such freedom of action. We understood time was running out on compromise,
                    if not public support, of the war and we would have liked a deal before Hanoi
                    fully grasped this.</p>
                <p>We realized that the agreement on Vietnam which we had in sight was the best
                    possible deal that we could get, given the situation on the ground, as well as
                    at home. The deal with Hanoi was very popularly received in the United States.
                    The hawks in the United States didn't like it, and the Saigon Government didn't
                    like it. However, overall, as I've just said, this was a major achievement. Most
                    of the critics in the United States had been saying that we not only had to get
                    out of Vietnam unilaterally but that there had to be some kind of coalition
                    government in place, or some approximation of it. The fact that in this
                    agreement we were able to withdraw from South Vietnam without determining its
                    political future or establishing a coalition government was considered a major
                    achievement, which I think it was. Without a doubt the idea of a mutual
                    withdrawal of forces was out of reach.</p>
                <p>So we had gotten the best deal we thought we could get, including getting our
                    prisoners-of-war back, confirmed aid for South Vietnam, and a cease-fire under
                    international supervision. We didn't get as much for Laos and Cambodia as we
                    would have liked to get. There were provisions for the resupply of South
                    Vietnam. We were able to provide as much military aid to South Vietnam as we
                    could before the agreement was signed. Also, the process of Vietnamization had
                    worked to a certain point. We weren't going to get a better deal, and it was on
                    this basis that we decided to go ahead with the agreement in hand.Finally, and
                    more specifically, we thought that this deal would hold up. We thought that
                    there might be low level, limited violations of the agreement or cease-fire
                    violations by Hanoi, which might nibble around the edges of the arrangements
                    made. However, through the Vietnamization program, the South Vietnamese were
                    sufficiently equipped and trained, they had some good troops, and we felt that
                    they could handle low level violations of the agreement. However, if North
                    Vietnam escalated these violations to all-out or at least very serious, naked
                    aggression, including openly sending troops and tanks across the DMZ, in a major
                    attack, we felt that the American people and Congress, despite their being sick
                    and tired of the war, would approve a substantial bombing offensive, though
                    still short of sending American troops back into South Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0293" n="Page0293"/>
                <p>We could bomb the hell out of Hanoi, making clear that, in a major way, the North
                    Vietnamese were violating the agreement. After all of the investment in American
                    resources and lives, we thought that the American people would want to support
                    enforcing an agreement which North Vietnam was blatantly violating, no matter
                    how they felt about the war as a whole. There would be much lower casualties
                    from an air war. This is not to denigrate these losses, but they would be much
                    lower than would be likely to be incurred in a renewed ground war.</p>
                <p>So on the military front the South Vietnamese, with our aid, would be able to
                    handle modest infractions of this agreement. And in response to major violations
                    of the agreement by North Vietnam, the American people and Congress would
                    support action, including a bombing response, even though they were sick of the
                    war.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, there was the Russian and the Chinese aspect. With our dramatic
                    opening to China, the major improvement in relations with Russia, both Russia
                    and China had a stake in not seeing the situation in Vietnam unravel. We thought
                    that the Chinese would accept even some bombing near their southern border with
                    Vietnam. There would be some strain in the relations between North Vietnam and
                    Russia and China. Therefore, we thought that Russia and China would help to
                    police the agreement to end the Vietnam War. We would not expect that they would
                    cut off aid to North Vietnam entirely, but we would expect that Russia and China
                    would urge Hanoi to observe the agreement, pointing out that it was a good deal
                    for the North Vietnamese. They could say that South Vietnam would fall into
                    their laps at some point and that Hanoi should avoid giving the Americans a
                    pretext to bomb North Vietnam even if they didn't ask Hanoi not to screw up
                    Russian and Chinese relations with the United States. So we thought that the
                    Russians and Chinese would help to support the implementation of the
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>Finally, a further reason why we thought that the agreement to end the Vietnam
                    War would hold together was the economic aid which we indicated that we would
                    consider providing to Hanoi. Not reparations, but aid in the reconstruction of
                    North Vietnam. I think that we estimated this aid might amount to about $2.5
                    billion. This would be a fraction of what the Vietnam War had cost us and could
                    help Hanoi to accelerate the reconstruction of North Vietnam. They could call
                    this help reparations if they chose to do so, but whatever they called it, they
                    would get help in rebuilding and developing the North Vietnamese economy. We
                    could provide such aid in an enlightened way, just as we did to Germany and
                    Japan after World War II. Also, we could try to normalize relations between the
                    U.S. and Hanoi. Kissinger agreed to go to Hanoi in February 1973, after the
                    agreement was signed. This would help the discussions on aid to North Vietnam,
                    as well as to assist in resolving the status of American personnel who had been
                    declared to be Missing-in-Action.</p>
                <pb facs="0294" n="Page0294"/>
                <p>We anticipated that in the Communist Politburo in Hanoi there would be a debate
                    on what North Vietnam should do. One alternative would be to work to clearly
                    undermine the agreement, at the risk of a resumption of American bombing of
                    North Vietnam. A counter-consideration would be that there would be some
                    significant, South Vietnamese resistance. Open violation of the agreement by the
                    North Vietnamese would risk annoying their friends in Moscow and Beijing and
                    losing a substantial amount of economic aid from the United States.</p>
                <p>The other choice would be for North Vietnam to observe the agreement, not to wait
                    for a decent interval to pass, but generally observing it. In this way the North
                    Vietnamese would avoid some of the retaliation that might be involved in
                    response to large scale violations of the agreement. Given their self confidence
                    and their staying power, as well as the pervasive corruption in South Vietnam,
                    they might expect to be able to take over South Vietnam after the passage of a
                    number of years. Meanwhile, the North Vietnamese could hope to get American
                    economic help and normalize diplomatic relations with the United States. By
                    limiting themselves to carrying out low level violations of the agreement, they
                    could hope to undermine and weaken the Saigon Government politically without
                    eliciting an American response. Over time they could hope to take over South
                    Vietnam anyway, while still getting our help and economic assistance.</p>
                <p>So we figured that a combination of threats and sticks, on the one hand,
                    including bombing of North Vietnam, and carrots like economic aid and
                    normalization, plus the influence of their allies in Moscow and Beijing and
                    building up South Vietnam through the Vietnamization program, would influence
                    Hanoi in the debate going on there. We thought that, on balance, they would
                    choose to respect the agreement in their own self interest, biding their time,
                    and postponing action to gain control of South Vietnam, if necessary waiting for
                    many years to achieve this goal. Together with our aid to South Vietnam this
                    would mean that the Saigon Government would have a fair chance to compete with
                    the Hanoi Government and to prevail. If the South Vietnamese didn't succeed in
                    this effort, in effect it would be the fault of the Saigon Government, through
                    corruption and a lack of democracy, whatever you want to call it.</p>
                <p>Well, that was our rationale. We knew that we were running some risks, but it was
                    the best we could get. We thought that it was an honorable ending to what we had
                    tried to do in Vietnam. We had rejected a major demand by Hanoi, which we
                    thought would have been dishonorable in the sense of making a political
                    capitulation. We got our prisoners-of-war back. South Vietnam was now in a
                    position where it could determine its political future. We laid this out
                    extensively in press releases anbackgrounders which provided a conceptual
                    framework, all of which I worked on with Kissinger and Negroponte.</p>
                <pb facs="0295" n="Page0295"/>
                <p>Within a few months after the signature of the Paris Accord in 1973, Hanoi began
                    to nibble around the edges of the agreement. I left the NSC [National Security
                    Council] staff in May, 1973. As I have done throughout my career, I wanted to
                    take a break. I was exhausted, mentally and physically. I wanted to spend more
                    time with my family and pursue other interests. I didn't know what I was going
                    to do next, but I was personally and emotionally exhausted. By then, the
                    situations regarding China, Russia, and Vietnam were all looking good. We had
                    achieved major breakthroughs. The President had received an overwhelming mandate
                    (this was before any real hint of Watergate). So this was a good time to leave
                    government service. Coincidentally, shortly before I left, I found out that I
                    had been wire tapped. We'll come back to that.</p>
                <p>Shortly after I left, and even before I left government service, the North
                    Vietnamese began to nibble around the edges of the cease-fire and began to
                    resupply their forces in South Vietnam in ways which violated the agreement. The
                    North Vietnamese continued to make trouble. While I was out of government
                    service, Kissinger went over to Paris to negotiate with Le Duc Tho (North
                    Vietnamese Politburo member) in an effort to get enforcement of the basic
                    agreement back on track. This effort didn't work out.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Congress was beginning to put limits on what we could do in Cambodia
                    and stopped the bombing there and in Laos. Finally, a couple of years later
                    Congress virtually put a stop to aid to South Vietnam, a truly dishonorable and
                    reckless act. So, over a period of time, the Saigon Government was being
                    undermined. Whatever its shortcomings - and there were serious ones - the
                    psychological and military impact at limiting and then stopping our aid was
                    devastating. And, of course, it encouraged Hanoi. In 1975 there was an all-out
                    offensive which resulted in the Communists taking over South Vietnam completely.
                    The remaining Americans were taken out of our Embassy by helicopter, and
                    everybody knows about that.</p>
                <p>What had happened involved several factors, including the four assumptions that I
                    mentioned. In terms of low-level violations of the agreement, for a while the
                    South Vietnamese were able to hold their own. But generally, the South
                    Vietnamese Army turned out to be weaker than we thought they might be after the
                    Vietnamization process. Toward the end, in 1975, when the South Vietnamese Army
                    was defeated in a hurry, Congress had already, and unconscionably, virtually cut
                    off military and economic aid to South Vietnam. Whatever you feel about the war,
                    we had negotiated this agreement with North Vietnam and had gone through all of
                    this torture and losses. Even though the South Vietnamese Government was not
                    perfect, our cutting off economic and military aid to them, when North Vietnam
                    was continuing to be resupplied by its allies and was breaking the agreement,
                    was absolutely immoral, in my opinion. Whether continued aid on our part would
                    have made all of that much difference is another issue, but has nothing to do
                    with the principle. And imperfect as the Saigon government was, it certainly was
                    preferable to the Hanoi Communists.</p>
                <pb facs="0296" n="Page0296"/>
                <p>In any event the economic and military aid which had been promised to the South
                    Vietnamese was not being delivered, which weakened them further. So our military
                    plans to handle the North Vietnamese threat turned out to be based on a mistaken
                    set of assumptions. This contributed to the South Vietnamese military
                    collapse.</p>
                <p>A second consideration was the major offensive by North Vietnam against South
                    Vietnam, to which we had planned to respond by bombing. This plan was undercut
                    by Congressional action in September 1973, prohibiting the further bombing of
                    targets in Southeast Asia. There was also the growing problem of the Watergate
                    Affair, which related to the manner of President Nixon's reelection in November,
                    1972. As a result, over time, the executive power of the U.S. administration was
                    effectively broken and our ability to take strong action against North Vietnam
                    was further weakened, on top of the general fatigue over the war. In its mood at
                    the time Congress wouldn't even go along with the promise to provide aid to
                    South Vietnam, let alone allowing bombing of North Vietnam. The North Vietnamese
                    figured all of this out, and so the various means of discouraging North Vietnam
                    from attacking South Vietnam were ineffective.</p>
                <p>China and Russia may have tried to lean on North Vietnam somewhat, but,
                    particularly in view of their rivalry with each other and competition for
                    influence in Hanoi, they couldn't sustain such a program and make their weight
                    felt under the circumstances.</p>
                <p>In terms of U.S. economic aid referred to in the Paris Agreement, Hanoi never got
                    it. We had told them two things. First, we told them that we had to get
                    Congressional approval to provide economic aid to Hanoi. Secondly, North Vietnam
                    would have to observe the Paris Agreement. There was some controversy as to
                    whether we had made a commitment to provide aid to North Vietnam. We made it
                    clear to Hanoi that we couldn't provide aid to North Vietnam without
                    Congressional approval, and we had already told the Congress that. Many members
                    of Congress didn't like the idea of providing any assistance to Hanoi. They also
                    didn't like the fact that we had made promises to provide such aid secretly,
                    even though we had hedged the promise by stating that we needed Congressional
                    approval to provide it. That created further controversy, which was worsened by
                    the fact that from the very beginning Hanoi began to violate the Paris Accord of
                    1973. These violations were fairly blatant, and then the North Vietnamese
                    escalated the situation by blatantly breaking the cease-fire agreement.</p>
                <p>Under these circumstances, we weren't about to give aid to North Vietnam, which
                    we couldn't get out of Congress anyway. So that incentive for Hanoi was rapidly
                    withering away.</p>
                <p>All of the sticks and carrots, in short, were effectively removed,and the Paris
                    Agreement collapsed.</p>
                <p>Q: One quick question regarding the POWs [Prisoners-of-War]. This is still an
                    emotional issue. Was there a feeling at the time that Hanoi might respond with
                    the release of more POWs in return for our providing U.S. aid?</p>
                <pb facs="0297" n="Page0297"/>
                <p>LORD: A fair question. Of course, I had to live with the POW issue for many
                    years. We worked very hard on the POW issue throughout the negotiation of the
                    Paris Accord on Vietnam, in the interests of justice and also to satisfy
                    domestic public opinion in the United States. It was a matter of crucial
                    importance to get all of our people back from captivity in North Vietnam, Laos,
                    and Cambodia. We were very tough on this issue.</p>
                <p>On paper the agreement on POWs reached with North Vietnam was very good. They
                    accepted the obligation to return all American Prisoners of War within 60 days
                    of the signature of the agreement [that is, by March 27, 1973]. They were to
                    turn over the POWs in increments, phased with the withdrawal of U.S. forces from
                    Vietnam. We would take some U.S. troops out of Vietnam and we would get some of
                    the POWs back. By the time all American troops had been withdrawn from Vietnam
                    the agreement provided that we would have all of our POWs back. That, in fact,
                    happened, in terms of the list of POWs which the North Vietnamese gave us on
                    January 27. Of those they admitted holding, we got all of them back within the
                    sixty-day period.</p>
                <p>However, there were two problems with this arrangement. First, we couldn't be
                    sure how many POWs the North Vietnamese had. We had received reports that many
                    of our people who had been shot down had been sighted in various places. We had
                    rumors of how many had died in captivity and how many were said to be held in
                    North Vietnam. Photographs of some of our MIAs were published in North
                    Vietnamese media. The POW list which North Vietnam gave us was shorter than we
                    had hoped to see. We couldn't prove that the North Vietnamese were cheating on
                    us and we didn't quite see what incentive they would have to keep some of our
                    POWs in captivity, even though we knew that they were brutal enough to do so.
                    Moreover, they might be covering up the deaths of some Americans in
                    captivity.</p>
                <p>Secondly, we weren't crystal clear on what the situation was of POWs who had
                    disappeared in Laos and Cambodia, that is, whether they were being held in those
                    countries. The North Vietnamese kept claiming that they didn't have full control
                    over Laos and Cambodia. We were able to be firmer in the agreement about the
                    withdrawal of North Vietnamese troops from those countries than about the return
                    of POWs. That was more vaguely treated in the cease-fire agreement. We got
                    several POWs back from Laos, but the number there also was less than we had
                    expected to receive. There weren't too many prisoners of war returned from
                    Cambodia.</p>
                <p>So we were not satisfied with the return of POWs from Vietnam, Laos, and
                    Cambodia. We were suspicious. However, in good faith we got a good deal on paper
                    and we thought we got the great majority, if not all, of the POWs back. However,
                    we were not entirely happy with North Vietnamese performance in this regard. The
                    list of POWs which we received from North Vietnam was considered shorter than
                    what we expected, but we could not prove that the North Vietnamese were
                    cheating. So we determined to keep pressing on this issue as our highest
                    priority, to make sure all returned and/or were accounted for.</p>
                <pb facs="0298" n="Page0298"/>
                <p>One of the reasons that we went to Hanoi in February, 1973, and I went along with
                    Kissinger on this occasion, was to try to move ahead with the normalization of
                    relations with North Vietnam. We thought that we might be able to influence the
                    debate in the Politburo of the ruling Communist Party in North Vietnam to tilt
                    them toward observation of the agreement. We also wanted very much to push
                    forward on the issue of the POWs. If we couldn't arrange for the release of
                    additional POWs, at least we hoped to get better information on those personnel
                    who had been declared Missing-in-Action. We had reports from Pentagon sources on
                    people that we thought were still alive and were still prisoners in North
                    Vietnam, on whom we had not obtained full information. We provided the North
                    Vietnamese with specific names of personnel reported to have been held in North
                    Vietnam and we asked them to provide more information on them. We didn't make
                    much progress during this trip to Hanoi in February 1973.</p>
                <p>However, we felt tremendous relief when we received back some 800 POWs or so.
                    We'll probably never know whether the North Vietnamese kept POWs alive and in
                    prison in North Vietnam but didn't return them to the U.S. There was some
                    feeling in some quarters that this happened, and some people, even today,
                    believe that they have information on others who continue to be held in North
                    Vietnam. I personally do not believe that many Americans really believe that.
                    Some Americans may believe this to this day, but I think that we will never
                    know. There have, at times, been sightings of Western-looking people in North
                    Vietnam, but usually they turn out to be French or from some country other than
                    the United States. In most cases these reports turned out to be defective in
                    this regard. There was never any solid proof that the North Vietnamese continued
                    to hold American POWs, despite considerable number of reports on Americans still
                    held in North Vietnam. All these were checked out. The issue - and out efforts -
                    continue to this day. It was a high priority for me as Assistant Secretary of
                    State in the early 1990s as we moved ahead with Hanoi.</p>
                <p>Right after the cease-fire agreement was signed, many thought Hanoi was holding
                    back but reports to this effect tended to die off with the passage of time. We
                    can't be sure, but the North Vietnamese may be embarrassed in terms of
                    accounting for the way in which some POWs were lost, executed, or tortured to
                    death in jails in North Vietnam before January, 1973, when they turned over to
                    us a list of POWs they held. Perhaps they didn't want to account for what had
                    happened to POWs who died under such circumstances.</p>
                <pb facs="0299" n="Page0299"/>
                <p>I have never been sure on this issue. The North Vietnamese were certainly brutal
                    and deceitful enough to have held on to American POWs. However, the reason that
                    I doubt this is that this would not have served the self-interest of the North
                    Vietnamese. I've discussed this before. If they were holding Americans secretly,
                    what purpose would be served? They would have had no negotiating leverage. And
                    if they admitted it belatedly there would be howls of outrage. So I never have
                    understood why it would have been to their interest to have held American POWs.
                    I think that it was in their self-interest to turn over all of the POWs they
                    held. Of course, once North Vietnam stated that it no longer held any American
                    military personnel who had been under detention in North Vietnam, it could no
                    longer admit that it had others who had not been returned. And I suspect that
                    some died in jails before January 1973 that Hanoi did not wish to account
                    for.</p>
                <p>It is certainly true that there were a lot of people missing whose status we
                    can't explain very well. Since the signature of the Vietnam Accord, we have
                    received a lot of remains, perhaps proving that a lot of people we thought were
                    alive were actually dead at the time of the signature of the Accord.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we'll stop at this point. We can put in the usual
                        end tthis section. Is there anything else that we should talk about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: There may be a few additional points, but I think that thapretty much
                    resolves it.</p>
                <p>***XII. NSC/STATE DEPARTMENT - RUSSIA (1969-1977)</p>
                <p>Q: This is April 7, 1999. Win, we now have you on the NSC staff. When were you
                    there? What did you deal with? What was your role in dealing with the Soviet
                    Union?</p>
                <p>LORD: Right. Going back to the NSC days, I was there from 1969 to 1973. We've
                    already covered two of the most central areas of my responsibility as
                    Kissinger's Special Assistant on the NSC staff. One was China, and the other was
                    Vietnam. We've also covered an area I spent a good deal of time on, namely,
                    drafting annual, Presidential statements at the beginning of each calendar year,
                    reviewing developments in our foreign policy. I've also mentioned preparing
                    early drafts of speeches for President Nixon and getting Kissinger ready for
                    background press interviews. As Special Assistant, I played a general, utility
                    infielder role on ad hoc issues and projects.</p>
                <p>The other, substantive issue that I was most involved in was relations with the
                    Soviet Union. Here, however, I was definitely in a supporting role. Hal
                    Sonnenfeldt and Bill Hyland were the key people working with Kissinger on this
                    issue. I sat in on many of the meetings and went on all of Kissinger's trips to
                    Moscow during the NSC years.</p>
                <pb facs="0300" n="Page0300"/>
                <p>As part of my duties as a Special Assistant to Kissinger, I was supposed to be a
                    global resource person for him. I was the one person working under Kissinger who
                    had an overall view of all of the key issues that we were working on. This
                    included Middle Eastern questions, as we went on further into the Nixon and then
                    the Ford administration. Kissinger wanted someone who could see the entire
                    picture, in addition to himself. I was paired with the experts in each case,
                    whether this involved China, Vietnam, Russia, or the Middle East.</p>
                <p>Det�nte, as it became known, was one of the key Nixon foreign policy priorities,
                    as well as a priority for Kissinger, along with the opening to China, ending the
                    Vietnam War, and movement on the Middle East. The relationship with Russia was
                    obviously crucial because we were in the middle of the Cold War, and the global
                    rivalry with the Soviet Union as a superpower was, for several Administrations,
                    the clear priority. Its expansionism presented both a geopolitical problem and
                    an ideological, value problem. This was a global struggle. However, President
                    Nixon and Kissinger, on a hard-headed basis, wanted to improve relations with
                    Moscow. They believed that the best way to do that was to have a policy that
                    mixed incentives and pressures, or carrots and sticks, and there would be
                    linkage between them. In this way we could try to move ahead across the
                    board.</p>
                <p>In the view of President Nixon, Russia was his best hope for bringing the Vietnam
                    War to a close. He had said during the election campaign of 1968 that he had a
                    secret plan for ending the war. However, he really didn't have one. What he had
                    in mind was to work with the Russians and try to get them to pressure Hanoi to
                    come to a reasonable settlement with the U.S., even as he would attempt to do
                    the same thing with China.</p>
                <p>In addition, with respect to the Russian factor, there was the Chinese dimension,
                    which was crucial. Kissinger and Nixon considered an opening to China as an end
                    in itself and a very important one. They also saw it as a way to influence
                    Russian behavior and U.S.-Russian relations. This was intended to keep Russia
                    off-balance by showing that we could deal with the rest of the Communist world,
                    not only in terms of Eastern Europe, which he had already begun to do, but also
                    with China. Kissinger and Nixon wanted to show that Moscow was not the only
                    spokesman for what some people considered a monolithic, communist bloc. They
                    wanted to give Moscow an incentive for improving relations with us because, as
                    long as they were worried about China, they would not want the U.S. and China to
                    gang up on them.</p>
                <p>Therefore, this triangular diplomacy was a central feature of the Nixon foreign
                    policy which Nixon and Kissinger crafted. There is no question that in
                    discussions with the Chinese, particularly the private discussions, there was a
                    lot of anti-Soviet flavor on both sides. This was clear from the remarks made by
                    Mao Zedong and Zhou En-lai on the Chinese side and Nixon and Kissinger on the
                    U.S. side in talking about the Russian threat to China along its borders with
                    Russia as well as globally. We never hid the fact that we also hoped to improve
                    relations with the Russians on a hard-headed basis.</p>
                <pb facs="0301" n="Page0301"/>
                <p>We didn't take such a decidedly anti-Chinese line in the discussions with the
                    Russians. We made it clear that we wanted to improve relations with China.
                    However, this also drew China's attentions because it knew that we had a lot
                    more negotiations and actual business with the Russians and a generally more
                    mature relationship than we had with China, which was just opening up.</p>
                <p>In any event, the idea was to improve relations with both countries, and have
                    better relations with each of them, than they would have with each other. Of
                    course, there were growing tensions in relations between the Chinese and
                    Russians, which most experts were sort of slow to pick up on but which were
                    clear by the late 1960s. This gave us an opportunity. The clashes along the
                    Russian-Chinese border during the summer of 1969 brought home to Nixon and
                    Kissinger as never before that there was a real chance to open up here. I
                    touched on this when I covered relations with China.</p>
                <p>Q: During these times were you called on to look at how the Chinese might feel
                    about the situation as we sort of played with the Soviets? Were you the person
                    who said: “Well, what do you think that the Chinese will feel about this?”</p>
                <p>LORD: I certainly got involved in that. Of course, John Holdridge and later
                    Richard Solomon, both China experts, also had an input here. The Russian
                    experts, such as Helmut Sonnenfeldt and Bill Hyland, would also look at this
                    factor, as well as Kissinger and, to a certain extent, Al Haig, who became
                    Kissinger's deputy as National Security Adviser. You're right that by having me
                    included in the Vietnam, China, and Russian initiatives, Kissinger had someone
                    who could help him and put on paper for President Nixon or for whatever other
                    audience were relevant how these factors interrelated. For example, how the
                    opening to China would have an impact on Russia, and we'll see in a minute how
                    dramatic that impact was. Further, by continuing to do business with Russia,
                    this would also give China an incentive to move ahead with us.</p>
                <pb facs="0302" n="Page0302"/>
                <p>Furthermore, we thought that by our dealing with both giants in the Communist
                    world we would have some psychological impact on Hanoi. This showed Hanoi that
                    Moscow and Beijing cared more about their bilateral relations with the U.S. than
                    they did about their relations with Hanoi. They wouldn't snub Hanoi, but
                    psychologically this would help to isolate Hanoi, e.g. holding summits in
                    Beijing and Moscow while we had some of our meetings with Hanoi in the winter
                    and spring of 1972, in the middle of Hanoi's offensive in South Vietnam. Neither
                    Moscow nor Beijing went so far as to cut off aid to North Vietnam or really lean
                    on Hanoi. However, both Moscow and Beijing had a stake in our trying to get the
                    Vietnam War behind us. We made clear to both Russia and China that we couldn't
                    withdraw from Vietnam dishonorably and were prepared for a military settlement
                    only. We made it clear that we wouldn't overthrow the Thieu government in South
                    Vietnam and install a coalition government. The political future of South
                    Vietnam had to be left to the Vietnamese people. We believed that both Russia
                    and China talked to Hanoi and suggested to North Vietnam that, in its own self
                    interest, they ought to settle for a military solution. The Russians and Chinese
                    could tell Hanoi that South Vietnam would ultimately fall in their lap over time
                    because South Vietnam was weak, and the U.S. would withdraw from Vietnam. We
                    were fairly confident that Moscow and Beijing made this kind of argument to
                    Hanoi, in their own self-interests of moving ahead with us.</p>
                <p>So there was this interplay between the three factors, and this made it exciting
                    and fascinating to be in on that. I was the only one, beside Kissinger, who was
                    involved in all three of these relationships.</p>
                <p>In the early going with the Russians in 1969-1970 the relationship between the
                    U.S. and Russia didn't make much progress. Indeed, there were some crises. There
                    was a challenge over a potential, Russian submarine base in Cuba [in
                    Cienfuegos]. There was Russian backing for radicals in the Middle East. There
                    were some tensions over Berlin. At the same time, there was the beginning of
                    arms control talks and the emergence of a possibility of holding a summit
                    meeting at some point between Russia and the U.S. This was a mixed bag, but the
                    point is that during the period from 1969 to 1970 we really weren't moving ahead
                    very effectively with the Russians, even though there were talks going on.</p>
                <p>Of course, as with respect to most key foreign policy issues, the Russians' key
                    interlocutor was Kissinger, and not the State Department. Kissinger and Soviet
                    Ambassador to the U.S., Dobrynin, would meet regularly, usually in the Map Room
                    of the White House to conduct private discussions and talks, as part of the
                    conduct of foreign policy out of the Nixon-Kissinger White House, which we
                    talked about before.</p>
                <p>So, from the very beginning, there was an effort to try to improve relations with
                    the Russians. We showed them that we would be tough when necessary, as we were
                    in some of these crises that I've mentioned. Also, we were prepared to try to
                    improve relations with Russia, if we could do so. We gave the Russians an
                    incentive to improve relations but showed them that we could be firm if they
                    pressed us on key areas.</p>
                <pb facs="0303" n="Page0303"/>
                <p>I remember a speech at the UN General Assembly in 1970 which, in this case, was
                    drafted primarily by Ray Price, one of President Nixon's speech writers. He was
                    a political moderate and we knew that when we wanted a more visionary, a more
                    centrist, moderate approach in a speech, whether it involved the Soviet Union or
                    anything else, Ray Price would probably be the speech writer. I worked with him,
                    Sonnenfeldt, Hyland, and others on this particular speech. If the speech
                    involved a tough approach to the Vietnamese, for example, appealing to the
                    silent majority, we could generally count on having Pat Buchanan assigned as the
                    primary drafter. Then, somewhere in between these two approaches would be Bill
                    Safire as the primary drafter of the speech. This was a very strong trio of
                    speech writers, to say the least.</p>
                <p>Q: You were in the speech writing business. What was your view of Pat Buchanan
                    and Bill Safire at that time, bearing in mind that both of them later went on to
                    further renown?</p>
                <p>LORD: First of all, regarding speech writing, I think that we already discussed
                    that. That is, we discussed how I would work with Kissinger on early,
                    substantive drafts of speeches on, for example, Vietnam, particularly in the
                    early 1970s. Then these three, very able speech writers would take these drafts
                    and give them much more lift and drive.</p>
                <p>In terms of writing, I had great respect for all three of them. I can't think of
                    a more effective team of speech writers. There have been individual speech
                    writers, like Ted Sorenson, who wrote for President Kennedy, and Peggy Noonan,
                    who wrote for President Reagan, who were outstanding. I don't know of any
                    President who has had three speech writers of the quality that President Nixon
                    had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're focusing on the Soviet Union now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, we'd better get back to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you particularly concerned when Pat Buchanan was
                        given aassignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I can't say that. First of all, in the drafting of speeches for Kissinger,
                    there wasn't too much interaction between his NSC staff and other people in the
                    White House, whether they were on the domestic side, people like Haldeman and
                    Ehrlichman, or even the speech writers. I don't recall sitting down and working
                    directly with one of the speech writers. I prepared drafts, with Kissinger's
                    guidance, which, when approved, turned over to one of them for polishing. I was
                    mostly involved in the early drafts of speeches, containing the substantive
                    thrust of the speech. I wasn't a great speech writer. I wasn't trying or able to
                    give one of these drafts the kind of eloquence required. Kissinger would talk to
                    the speech writers. As they would prepare drafts or re-drafts, we would see them
                    and review them for substance.</p>
                <pb facs="0304" n="Page0304"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that Pat Buchanan went for the red
                        meat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Buchanan would go for the red meat, domestic support, and the silent
                    majority. He would probably help people like Vice President Spiro Agnew with
                    their speeches as well. Bill Safire was more difficult to type, although he was
                    clearly more conservative than Ray Price. So we gained some sense of the
                    emphasis the President was going to give the speech by the speech writer who was
                    assigned to draft the speech. However, there was nothing automatic about this.
                    Since I was generally of a more moderate persuasion, I obviously would be more
                    comfortable if I thought that Ray Price was writing the speech. I had personal
                    respect for all three of the speech writers and their ability. No question about
                    it.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, we were still trying to move ahead with the Soviets, going back and
                    forth. As we moved toward 1971 and the channels of secret communication with the
                    Chinese were beginning to warm up and we were beginning to head toward the
                    Kissinger secret trip to China in July, 1971, we had one, significant break that
                    I worked on, the statement on an interim, arms control agreement. I don't recall
                    all of the details now, but it was259 drafted some time in 1970 or 1971.
                    Sonnennfeldt and Hyland were of course central. This statement dealt with
                    offensive and defensive arms. I received a note of thanks from President Nixon,
                    one of several generous personal letters to me on my service. That was one
                    significant step with the Russians. But there were other, continuing tensions,
                    and we weren't making much progress. The Russians weren't interested, or
                    certainly were not as interested as President Nixon was, in a possible summit
                    meeting.</p>
                <p>So that was the general situation as we went on Kissinger's secret trip to China
                    in July 1971. In all of my career experience I never saw such an immediate
                    impact of one event on relations with another country as the impact of the
                    Kissinger trip on our relations with the Russians and the announcement that
                    President Nixon would be going to China. As I said we were going back and forth
                    with the Russians, at that time, and they were dragging their feet on the
                    proposed summit meeting.</p>
                <p>As we headed toward China on Kissinger's publicly announced trip to Vietnam,
                    Thailand, India and Pakistan, we tried one more time with Al Haig sitting back
                    in Washington to see whether the Russians would agree to a summit meeting,
                    before we went to China. Of course, the Russians didn't know that we were going
                    to China. We were originally prepared to have the first summit meeting with
                    Moscow and the second summit meeting with Beijing.</p>
                <pb facs="0305" n="Page0305"/>
                <p>So as we were traveling, as I mentioned already, I received a phone call on July
                    5 from Al Haig in the middle of the night, when we were in Bangkok. In this call
                    Haig talked to me over an open line. He used code words for security purposes,
                    but I knew what he was talking about. He made clear that he had seen Soviet
                    Ambassador Dobrynin one more time to suggest a summit meeting. Once again, the
                    Russians put it off with the vague comment that the time wasn't ripe for it.
                    Little did the Russians know that we were about to go to China to arrange a
                    summit meeting with the Chinese. The Russians would therefore be coming after
                    the Chinese, which would be very annoying for them. If the Russians had known
                    that, they would certainly have agreed to a summit meeting earlier.</p>
                <p>Literally within weeks, if not days, after the July 15, 1971, announcement by
                    President Nixon at San Clemente of Kissinger's secret trip and that Nixon would
                    be going to China early in 1972, relations with the Russians really began to
                    move. We had clearly gotten their attention. For example, within a few weeks the
                    Russians agreed to a summit meeting, which subsequently took place in May, 1972,
                    a few months after the summit meeting with the Chinese. There was further
                    movement on the Berlin negotiations which had been going on for some time but
                    inconclusively. Kissinger was conducting these negotiations, working - through
                    backchannels - closely through our Ambassador to Bonn, Kenneth Rush, and with
                    the Russians. There was movement on the issue of arms control, which ultimately
                    resulted in the SALT-I [Strategic Arms Limitation Talks] Agreement, which was
                    signed at the Moscow Summit Meeting of 1972. There was more systematic
                    discussion of economic and trade links with Russia. So, right across the board,
                    in the wake of the China announcement, we began to make progress with the
                    Russians. This was the clearest example of the positive impact of triangular
                    diplomacy.</p>
                <p>Q: Win, what evaluation were we getting, probably more from Hal Sonnenfeldt and
                    Bill Hyland, within the NSC [National Security Council] staff, regarding our
                    impression that the Soviets were not interested in having a summit meeting with
                    us at that time? Did they want to stay away from the Vietnam issue?</p>
                <p>LORD: That's a very good question. I'm not sure I can answer that. Frankly, I
                    can't reconstruct now the reasons for the Soviet attitude. It's a very good
                    point. You would think that the Soviets would see that a summit meeting was in
                    their interest, as this would give them status as an equal to the U.S. The
                    Soviets always wanted to be treated as an equal with us. A Soviet-American
                    summit meeting would solidify this. I am quite sure that we made clear that the
                    prospective summit meeting would take place in Moscow, which was a further
                    concession to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: President Nixon had not had a summit meeting with Brezhnev
                        at thatime.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No.</p>
                <pb facs="0306" n="Page0306"/>
                <p>Q: So we're really talking about an administration which was still newly in
                    office at that time. There had been no personal contact with Soviet leaders at
                    that point.</p>
                <p>LORD: That's correct. The first time that Kissinger met with Brezhnev, I was with
                    Kissinger in the secret trip to Moscow in April 1972, to set up a summit
                    meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a time when Kissinger went to Moscow and didn't
                        tell thAmbassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. I'm just trying to recall the circumstances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That kind of thing came up fairly frequently.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. Jacob Beam was the Ambassador to the Soviet Union at the time. I think
                    that Brent Scowcroft was in Moscow at the same time. This secret trip took place
                    April 24, 1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can fill that in later on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Why don't I just put in the record that there was a call from Al Haig when
                    we were in Bangkok at 3:00 AM on July 5, 1971. The secret trip to Moscow to
                    prepare for the summit meeting began on April 20, 1972.</p>
                <p>However, the basic point was that the Russians were dragging their feet about
                    arranging for a summit meeting. But once they saw that President Nixon was going
                    to go to Beijing, they moved quickly on inviting him to come to Moscow. There
                    was probably debate within the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet
                    Union on how to deal with the Americans and how suspicious to be in the
                    negotiations. We could be tough with them at the same time that we offered them
                    incentives. We warned them off establishing a submarine base in Cuba, and in
                    September 1970, we backed the Jordanians against Syrian pressures, backed by the
                    Russians.</p>

                <p>LORD: That's right. In 1970 there were those two questions, as well as tension
                    involving Berlin. At the same time we indicated that we would try to move ahead
                    on arms control and prepare for a summit meeting. I'm sure that we were dangling
                    some economic incentives for the Russians. So I'm unable to answer your question
                    about the summit. They were clearly not that embarrassed about Vietnam. As we
                    will see later, they welcomed President Nixon to Moscow right in the middle of
                    Hanoi's offensive against us and our retaliation by bombing Hanoi and mining the
                    harbor at Haiphong. Yet the Soviets went ahead with the discussions with the
                    United States. By itself, North Vietnam could not have prevented the Soviet
                    Union from having a summit meeting with us. There must have been debates in the
                    Politburo on the advisability of negotiations with the U.S. and how much to
                    trust us. However, to this day I'm not clear on this subject.</p>
                <p>Q: It is a puzzling thing. When you reflect on this, you might recall that Nixon
                    was newly installed in office as President. He was showing a certain interest in
                    foreign affairs. You would think that, since this summit meeting was to take
                    place in Moscow, the Russians would have been eager to show that they were a big
                    player. I think that you're right. It was probably some political affair or
                    might have been a problem within the Politburo.</p>
                <p>LORD: I'm sure that one possibility was that we indicated that we didn't want a
                    summit meeting just for show, unlike the summit with China where the meeting was
                    the message - reopening relations after 23 years of mutual isolation and
                    hostility. We wanted to have some substantive achievements come out of it. We
                    thought that, central to that, there had to be something on arms control. It may
                    well have been that the Soviet military leaders, who were rather conservative,
                    didn't like some of the arms control limitations that were being kicked around.
                    Maybe their hesitation about entering into an arms control agreement, which
                    would logically be the central achievement of a summit meeting, slowed things
                    down. It may be that they were holding out and trying to make President Nixon
                    make more concessions, thinking maybe that he was eager for a summit meeting. If
                    they dragged their feet, they might get such concessions immediately near the
                    summit meeting.</p>
                <p>The Soviets may have hoped to extract additional concessions from the U.S. in
                    order to get a summit meeting, whether they involved arms control or anything
                    else. I think that is the most likely reason, based on tactical, rather than
                    strategic considerations. I'm sure that the Soviets would have welcomed a summit
                    meeting, particularly in Moscow. They probably figured that by dragging out the
                    process, they would be able to get a more reasonable U.S. position on certain
                    issues. They saw the negotiations leading to a summit meeting as a sort of
                    bargaining chip. I think that is the most reasonable explanation, because the
                    Russians were fairly crude in their negotiating tactics. They had the mentality
                    of rug merchants.</p>
                <pb facs="0308" n="Page0308"/>
                <p>The Chinese, although they were just as tough as the Russians, were more apt to
                    put out their basic position at the beginning of negotiations and not haggle
                    over it. They would say that this or that is what they had to have. They would
                    ask: “What does the United States need?” The Russians would deliberately inflate
                    their positions, knowing that we would chip away at their positions. They would
                    expect us to inflate our positions in a similar way. The Vietnamese communists
                    were totally intransigent all the way along. They were basically revolutionaries
                    who didn't like to negotiate and just stonewalled us until conditions were such
                    that they had to make a move, as they did in the negotiations with us in the
                    fall of 1972. When the Israelis negotiate, they are something like Talmudic
                    scholars, legal experts who look at every last semicolon. They are insecure
                    because of their history and geography regarding any agreements made. The Arabs
                    are more romantic in outlook, and you have to appeal to some of those elements
                    in negotiating with them.</p>
                <p>One of the fascinating experiences we had during this period was to observe the
                    different negotiating styles of other countries. Even if Kissinger was not
                    experienced in the history and culture of these countries, he was very skillful
                    in figuring out pretty quickly, not only their national interests, but also
                    their cultural, negotiating styles. He would then adjust his own tactics
                    accordingly.</p>
                <p>In any event, getting back to the Russians, in the course of the 1970s we made
                    several trips to Moscow. I'll get back to some of them in greater detail. I
                    think that I was on five or six of these trips, before, during, and after the
                    first summit meeting, as we tried to move our relationship further along. There
                    were two, generic experiences which were interesting in this connection.</p>
                <p>First, except for the summit meeting itself, when we stayed at the Kremlin, we
                    stayed in the Lenin Hills Guest House outside of Moscow. This was a VIP [Very
                    Important Persons] Visitors' residence or dacha. It overlooked Moscow and was
                    located near Moscow University. Of course, just as was the case in China, we
                    assumed that our quarters there were bugged at all times and so we had to be
                    very careful. Particularly with the Russians - we didn't do this so much with
                    the Chinese - we used a machine called a “babbler.” I'm not sure whether I've
                    already mentioned this, but it was a recording machine in which you put in a
                    tape. When it plays, it sounds like a dozen cocktail parties all going on at
                    once. It's supposed to drown out bugging. If you talk softly, against the
                    backdrop of this babbling, it does the job. It basically consists of a recording
                    of the comments of a lot of different people all talking at the same time at
                    different frequencies or levels. It's designed to shut out any listening
                    devices. I'm sure that it was pretty crude and may have been ineffective, but it
                    at least complicated Russian listening devices when we talked softly. The
                    problem was that it could drive you absolutely crazy. After about 10 minutes of
                    this noise, you were ready to tear your hair out.</p>
                <pb facs="0309" n="Page0309"/>
                <p>There were a lot of jokes about this device. When we were in China, we usually
                    found that it was easier to walk outside the guesthouse where we were staying
                    and talk during walks outside, rather than when we were inside, where our
                    conversations would have been bugged. I suspected, in the case of China, that
                    the trees were probably bugged as well. The babbler was a source of great
                    frustration but also mirth.</p>
                <p>There were other aspects. In our dacha the attendants included some fairly
                    attractive women. The Russians were very crude in this respect. It was clear
                    that they weren't above using these women for blackmail purposes, if at all
                    possible. I was never directly approached in this regard, but it was pretty
                    clear that they were trying to tempt Kissinger and, of course, any of us if we
                    were stupid enough, not to mention not being monogamous. I happen to be
                    monogamous and not stupid. Any of us could have gotten into trouble,
                    particularly Kissinger. There were sort of crude jokes made. Of course, he
                    ignored all of this. However, this shows you some Russian crudity, which I don't
                    think that you would find in China.</p>
                <p>We also used to joke about how they would drive us nuts. There was a pool table
                    in the dacha. I swear that the pockets you shoot the balls into were smaller
                    than the balls. Actually, they weren't, but they were small enough so that it
                    was particularly difficult to play pool at this table. The pockets seemed
                    smaller than they should be. We figured that this might be psychological
                    warfare.</p>
                <p>One final note is that the Russians proved that you could really stagger around
                    because, unlike the Chinese delicacies, the Russians would provide massive
                    displays of food on the table in the guest house. These included caviar, very
                    heavy bread, and all kinds of meat, fish and fowl. I'm sure that the caloric and
                    cholesterol level in this food was extraordinarily high.I might mention that the
                    motorcades from our dacha to the Kremlin, for example, involved some of the most
                    hair-raising travel that I've ever experienced. The chauffeurs would drive very
                    fast, and each car would be about one foot behind the car ahead of it. If any
                    car stopped suddenly, we would have an incredible, chain reaction car crash. It
                    was always nerve-wracking to be in those motorcades. These are just some
                    colorful aspects of a visit to Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the secret meeting...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: We stayed at the dacha for both the secret and the publimeetings, except
                    for the Kremlin during the summit.</p>
                <p>Q: The secret meeting was the one where the U.S. Ambassador was not informed
                    about it until afterwards. Were you sort of under strict instructions to stay
                    away from the Embassy?</p>
                <pb facs="0310" n="Page0310"/>
                <p>LORD: It was part of this crazy system which is now hard to believe. It wasn't
                    just the Ambassador who was not informed. I believe that Brent Scowcroft must
                    have been a military assistant at the time. He wasn't working directly for
                    Kissinger. He was visiting the Embassy in Moscow as well. I believe that the
                    Ambassador found out or was told afterwards that we had been there in Moscow. As
                    I recall it, I think that we went to Moscow at the last minute. Preparations for
                    the visit were made at the last minute, as it were. As I said earlier, the
                    summit meeting, for which this secret meeting was held to make arrangements for,
                    was held in May 1972.</p>
                <p>I think that we were due to go somewhere else. There was some kind of an official
                    dinner party in Washington. We got the word that very evening at the dinner
                    party that we were going to go to Moscow instead. It seems incredible. We
                    traveled in Air Force Two [U.S. Air Force Special Missions Aircraft, a VC-137
                    Boeing, much like a Boeing 707. Air Force Two was usually reserved for the Vice
                    President or the Secretary of State.] We left Washington so quickly that we gave
                    a ride to Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin on our plane going to Moscow. It was truly
                    a last minute decision.</p>
                <p>I have some recollection that there was some place where we were supposed to go,
                    perhaps China. We changed our itinerary. This shows you how reliable my memory
                    of this period is. In any case, the Embassy in Moscow did not know about the
                    Kissinger visit. The Embassy was engaged in logistical planning for the summit
                    meeting, but we were in Moscow for last minute preparations on substantive
                    issues. I don't recall any of the actual details.</p>
                <p>What was fascinating was the lead up to the summit meeting itself. During the
                    spring of 1972 Hanoi launched a major offensive in South Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the Easter Offensive of 1972.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, the Easter Offensive. It involved the use of tanks and heavy weapons.
                    It was clearly an escalation of the war. Therefore, President Nixon was faced
                    with a difficult decision, as he was preparing to go to Moscow a few weeks
                    later. It was his instinct to respond brutally and swiftly to Hanoi in terms of
                    the offensive itself, which contained the danger of really threatening South
                    Vietnam's viability. We also needed to try to get the North Vietnamese back to
                    the negotiating table, because when you were dealing with Hanoi, you had to deal
                    with them firmly, as well as making offers to them. The problem for President
                    Nixon was that, if he responded to this offensive in a brutal way, would this
                    jeopardize the summit meeting in Moscow? The Russians might say that they could
                    not welcome him in Moscow while we were attacking their so-called allies.</p>
                <pb facs="0311" n="Page0311"/>
                <p>So there were debates within Kissinger's staff in which I took part, in the
                    Situation Room and elsewhere in the White House as to what our reaction should
                    be to the Hanoi offensive. We needed to keep in mind our Vietnam objectives but
                    also our interest in arranging for a summit meeting in Moscow. On the one hand
                    there was the fear that the Russians might cancel the summit meeting if we took
                    vigorous action against the North Vietnamese. If this happened, we would lose an
                    awful lot of work expended over a couple of years to improve relations with the
                    Russians. We were on the verge of reaching the SALT-1 Agreement [First phase of
                    the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks] and some economic agreements. The Berlin
                    Agreement was also moving forward at that point. Also, of course, the summit
                    trip itself was a dramatic double header, with the China summit trip just a
                    couple of months before that, in terms of our diplomatic achievements generally,
                    isolating Hanoi, and, not incidentally, affecting the prospects of Nixon's
                    reelection in 1972. This would show that Nixon was a man of peace and that he
                    had made major foreign policy moves. If the summit meeting with the Russians was
                    canceled, not only would this summit meeting be down the drain, but the SALT-1
                    and all of the other agreements that were being prepared for the summit meeting
                    would be in jeopardy.</p>
                <p>There was a general agonizing debate about whether a brutal response to Hanoi for
                    its 1972 offensive was worth losing all of the fruits of work done with the
                    Russians over a period of two or three years. This also included the opening to
                    China, which could be affected if Beijing saw we had real trouble with
                    Moscow.</p>
                <p>On the other side of the ledger, and what was uppermost in the mind of President
                    Nixon, was first that he could not let Hanoi get away with undertaking a major
                    offensive in South Vietnam. This was clearly an escalation and a challenge, even
                    as we were conducting secret negotiations with the North Vietnamese to end the
                    war, after all. Also, there would be the embarrassment for President Nixon to go
                    to Moscow while Hanoi was pummeling South Vietnam and American troops fighting
                    there, killing Americans who were defending South Vietnam, as well as South
                    Vietnamese troops. Moscow, of course, was still supplying North Vietnam with
                    weapons and equipment for carrying on this offensive. President Nixon would be
                    in Moscow, trying to negotiate agreements with the Russians while the Russians
                    were backing a tough offensive in South Vietnam, killing American troops. So
                    there was debate along these lines among President Nixon's advisers.</p>
                <p>President Nixon decided for two reasons that he was going to bomb around Hanoi
                    and mine the harbor at Haiphong. This would be a major escalation on our part.
                    First there was the factor of the negotiations with Hanoi to end the war, which
                    was a matter of face, incentives, and seeking to achieve a more peaceful
                    settlement in South Vietnam, both to protect American troops and South Vietnam.
                    A tough response would help stabilize the battlefield balance which in turn was
                    key at the bargaining table. To look weak, on the other hand, would cause Hanoi
                    to be even more intransigent.</p>
                <pb facs="0312" n="Page0312"/>
                <p>Secondly, President Nixon decided that he wasn't about to go to Russia looking
                    weak, both to his domestic, American audience, and to Hanoi and the world. He
                    didn't want to go to Hanoi's chief supplier of arms and equipment for carrying
                    out this escalation, striking deals while we didn't defend our troops and our
                    allies.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, and most interestingly, I believe that President Nixon was about the
                    only American policy-maker who felt that he could get away with a tough stance,
                    i.e. still preserve the Moscow summit. I could be wrong about this. He was
                    confident that the Russians would not cancel the summit meeting with the U.S. So
                    Nixon felt that he could have his cake and eat it, too. He could be tough and
                    brutal against the Hanoi offensive and still go ahead and reap the benefits of
                    the summit meeting. Nixon would appear to be tough, even as he made deals with
                    the Russians, by showing that he wasn't a wimp on the Hanoi front. I believe
                    that President Nixon felt that Brezhnev and other Russian leaders valued U.S. -
                    Soviet relations and the summit meeting more than they did their ties with
                    Hanoi. He thought that the Russians would stomach the bombing around Hanoi and
                    the mining of the harbor at Haiphong, even while Nixon was in Moscow.Frankly, I
                    thought that the summit meeting with the Russians might well be canceled. I was
                    wrong in this respect, both in my predictions and my advice. Kissinger was more
                    ambivalent in this respect. He thought that we had to be tough, but he was very
                    concerned about losing the fruits of all of the hard work we had put in to
                    improve relations with the Russians. He was more fearful that the summit meeting
                    might be canceled if we responded in a tough and even brutal way to the North
                    Vietnamese. I'll leave it to Kissinger to speak for himself as to how he came
                    out on this issue. He has done so in his volume of memoirs on this period.</p>
                <p>Some of Nixon'advisers felt that we should be tough, even if we lost the summit
                    meeting with the Russians. Some may have felt that we should be tough and that
                    we might not lose the summit meeting in any case. Basically, this was a decision
                    made by President Nixon, showing his visionary and courageous outlook. He felt
                    that we should be tough for the reasons I have mentioned. He said that,
                    furthermore, we wouldn't lose the summit meeting in Moscow anyway. Most
                    disagreed with him. He proved to be right. We bombed Hanoi and we mined the
                    harbor at Haiphong, which constituted a major escalation. Nevertheless, we went
                    ahead with a very successful summit meeting in Moscow.</p>

                <p>LORD: I think that's absolutely right. I think that if the China factor hadn't
                    been there, in the first place we might not have had a summit meeting in Moscow.
                    Or, the Russians might have canceled the meeting. But it was more difficult for
                    them to cancel Nixon's trip to Russia now he had been to China.</p>

                <p>LORD: But when we went ahead with the meeting in China...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We would have had the meeting with China, and the Soviets
                        woulhave been left out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I think that's absolutely right. I think that the China factor was crucial,
                    not only in terms of the major impetus it gave to our relationship with Russia
                    but also in being able to go ahead with the summit meeting in Moscow and our
                    continued work on other issues. Keep in mind that the Shanghai Communique with
                    the Chinese in February, 1972, specifically had a phrase in it about both China
                    and the United States opposing hegemony in Asia or elsewhere. Now who was going
                    to practice hegemony in the world? Who could that possibly have been but Moscow?
                    So it was pretty clear that we were getting Moscow's attention. We walked right
                    up to the edge of being provocative to do that. We also had to demonstrate to
                    our public and to the Chinese public why we and the Chinese were getting
                    together. You will remember that the Shanghai Communique had all these
                    differences between us listed in it, both on specific issues as well as on
                    ideology.</p>
                <p>Q: With Kissinger keeping Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin abreast of this, we were
                    just not going to lose in this connection. The Soviets were supplying the North
                    Vietnamese. We could say to the Russians to knock this off and we would knock
                    off what we were doing.</p>
                <p>LORD: Absolutely. The constant factor for a couple of years with the Russians
                    was, first of all, what we said wouldn't be all that explicit. It would depend
                    on how you would phrase it. We would make our points primarily in Washington in
                    discussions with Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin but also when we went to Moscow and
                    would see Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, as well as Soviet President Brezhnev.
                    The basic themes we would follow would be that we were trying honorably to end
                    the Vietnam War, but we were not going to do it dishonorably. We would suggest
                    to the Soviets to advise the North Vietnamese to settle for a military
                    settlement only and that we would not attempt to decide the future of the South
                    Vietnamese, which they would decide for themselves. We would say, furthermore,
                    that it was in the interest of the Russians to get this war behind us so that we
                    wouldn't have this major problem in our bilateral relationship. Certainly,
                    Soviet interest with us in arms control, stability in Europe, and economic
                    cooperation with the U.S. were of much greater importance than sticking with
                    these fanatic friends of the Soviet Union, who were just complicating the
                    situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0314" n="Page0314"/>
                <p>We would make clear to the Soviets that we would not expect them to sell out
                    their friends, the North Vietnamese. However, we expected the Russians, in their
                    own self interest, to pressure the North Vietnamese to be reasonable. We would
                    say that, on this particular occasion, when Hanoi launched its Easter Offensive
                    of 1972, this was outrageous. The Russians knew that we were negotiating with
                    the North Vietnamese in an effort to reach a reasonable settlement. Meanwhile,
                    the North Vietnamese had undertaken this major offensive. We would also say that
                    furthermore, President Nixon cannot go to Moscow while the Soviet Union is
                    supplying the North Vietnamese with weapons, with which they are killing U.S.
                    troops, without responding vigorously.</p>
                <p>Obviously, the line which Kissinger took, at this point, was to tell the Soviets
                    that we were escalating the pressure on the North Vietnamese. He pointed out
                    that it was Russia's friends that had caused this problem, not us. Kissinger
                    said: “You can understand that no President can go to Moscow and not make a
                    tough response to what the North Vietnamese are doing.”</p>
                <p>Frankly, I believe that the Russians understood all of this. Above all, they
                    understood that their bilateral relations with the U.S. were more important than
                    their relations with Hanoi. And there was the continuing China factor.</p>
                <p>Q: This line also helped to emphasize something which had happened again and
                    again. That is, how the great powers become almost slaves to their satellite
                    countries.</p>
                <p>LORD: At least the Soviets understood that it greatly complicatetheir lives.</p>
                <p>Q: And Soviet control over the North Vietnamese was not that great. In the same
                    sense our control over the South Vietnamese was also not that great.</p>
                <p>LORD: That's correct. We can see this today in the sense that China finds North
                    Korea a pain in the neck. China is not about to sell them out, but it does
                    complicate life for the Chinese. North Korea fires missiles in Asia, and this
                    upsets Japan and gets Japan and Taiwan interested in anti-missile defense.</p>
                <p>Let me talk a little bit about the Moscow summit meeting itself. It really was a
                    rather dramatic meeting. As I said, we stayed for several days in the Kremlin,
                    and several agreements were reached. One of these was the initial SALT
                    [Strategic Arms Limitation Talks] agreement. Kissinger was putting the last
                    pieces of this agreement together, even as the negotiating team led by
                    Ambassador GeralSmith was in Geneva, trying to put other pieces together which
                    related to it. There was always some lingering controversy whether, under the
                    pressure of the summit meeting, Nixon and Kissinger made some last minute
                    concessions to get a deal which Ambassador Gerald Smith and others felt were
                    unnecessary. I'll leave that to the historians. The eventual, SALT-1 agreement
                    which was negotiated was good for us and the Russians in terms of putting a cap
                    on the nuclear arms race. It was the first major pact of its kind.</p>
                <pb facs="0315" n="Page0315"/>
                <p>Subsequent negotiations by President Reagan and his successors were called START
                    [Strategic Arms Reduction Talks]. That idea was to begin to reduce, not just
                    limit, the number of nuclear weapons. What we were trying to do during this
                    period was to stop the further escalation of nuclear weapons, both offensive and
                    defensive.</p>
                <p>I remember Kissinger explaining the agreement in the middle of the summit
                    meeting, on his 49th birthday in a Moscow night club, which was quite
                    interesting. There were also economic agreements for more trade which would take
                    place between our two countries, as well as a variety of other things, such as a
                    space cooperation agreement and an accord on principles of international
                    behavior. Altogether, these made it a very substantive summit meeting, as well
                    as a very dramatic one.</p>
                <p>However, the single, most interesting episode for me, personally, had to do with
                    Vietnam. The Russians clearly felt that they had to show that they were not
                    ignoring the Vietnam issue. The Russians had to show Hanoi that they hadn't
                    completely sold them out. So there was one meeting where, it was agreed, we
                    would talk about Vietnam with the Russians. It was going to be held in
                    Brezhnev's country dacha [country residence] about a 45 minute to one hour's
                    drive away from the Kremlin. The plan was to have a small meeting on this
                    subject. It was clear that the Russians wanted to talk tough and then send a
                    transcript of the discussions with us back to Hanoi to show that they had stood
                    by their friends.</p>
                <pb facs="0316" n="Page0316"/>
                <p>One of the more hair-raising experiences of my life, which was humorous in
                    retrospect but which left me close to panic at the time, had to do with missing
                    a Presidential motorcade. We were in the Kremlin for a signature of a scientific
                    and space agreement between Brezhnev and President Nixon. It was one of a series
                    of agreements which were to be signed with the Russians. The plan was, after the
                    signing ceremony and reception, that President Nixon would go to his quarters in
                    the Kremlin and freshen up for half an hour or so before going out to Brezhnev's
                    dacha for the meeting on Vietnam, which was to take place in the late afternoon
                    and evening. Right after the signature of the agreement, while people were still
                    clinking glasses of champagne and so forth, John Negroponte, who was the Vietnam
                    expert on the National Security Council staff at the time, having replaced Dick
                    Smyser, and I, went back to our offices in the Kremlin to gather up the briefing
                    books for this meeting between President Nixon and Brezhnev. To our horror we
                    found out that Nixon and Brezhnev, right after the signing ceremony, had agreed
                    that they didn't need to freshen up and decided to go right out to Brezhnev's
                    dacha.So they went right to the motorcade, and Kissinger himself had to scramble
                    to join the President. They entered the motorcade and left the Kremlin without
                    John Negroponte and me. There were only four Americans scheduled to be present
                    at the meeting: Nixon, Kissinger, Negroponte, and me. You could argue that our
                    missing the motorcade wasn't our fault, and it certainly wasn't. That's
                    irrelevant. You don't miss a Presidential motorcade. We had visions of Nixon and
                    Kissinger being absolutely infuriated that their staff wasn't with them. We had
                    all of the briefing books. We assumed that Nixon and Kissinger were planning to
                    be looking at the briefing books in the motorcade on the way out to the meeting
                    at Brezhnev's dacha, so that they would be prepared.</p>
                <p>Of course, Kissinger, whom I admired in many respects, is known to have a
                    considerable temper. We had visions of losing our jobs due to a disaster at the
                    meeting, or holding up the meeting while they waited for us. We went out to the
                    street, desperately trying to catch up with the Nixon motorcade. Well, of
                    course, the KGB [Soviet secret police] was not about to allow us to get into any
                    car and head out to Brezhnev's dacha. So they totally stonewalled us, they
                    wouldn't let us get into a car, and they wouldn't let us go anywhere. We finally
                    turned to Bill Hyland, who spoke Russian and interceded with the KGB people.
                    They finally said: “Wait until Brezhnev and Nixon get to the dacha. We'll be in
                    touch with them out there and we'll see whether you people can go out.” That
                    wasn't the point. We wanted to catch up with them. We were just frantic for
                    about 45 minutes.</p>
                <pb facs="0317" n="Page0317"/>
                <p>Finally, we received permission to go out to the Brezhnev dacha, and we went out
                    in the usual speedy hair raising drive, figuring that our careers were just
                    about over. To our great relief, when we got there, we found that Brezhnev had
                    taken Nixon out on a boat. That was on purpose, to give Nixon a little fun
                    before the meeting; the delay wasn't intended to fill in the time while they
                    waited for us. We got to the dacha while Brezhnev and Nixon were still in the
                    boat out on the lake, so we got there in time for the meeting, although Nixon
                    and Kissinger still didn't have the briefing books. Well, even the briefing
                    books were largely irrelevant, because Nixon and Kissinger knew that this was
                    not going to be a negotiating session where you need your talking points and
                    positions to refer to. They were just going to listen to some tough lectures
                    from the Russian leaders. So to our great surprise and relief, Nixon and
                    Kissinger took in stride the fact that we hadn't gone out to the dacha with them
                    and were very relaxed about it. So our nightmare was over.</p>
                <p>We then went into the meeting, which lasted for three hours, at least. On our
                    side, as I said, were Nixon, Kissinger, Negroponte, and myself. On the Soviet
                    side were secretary-general Brezhnev, prime minister Kosygin, president
                    Podgorny, who was the third-ranking among the Russians, and Alexandrov, the
                    Soviet national security adviser, plus the Soviet interpreter, Viktor Sukodorov.
                    I may not be pronouncing the interpreter's name correctly. It was a very small
                    meeting.</p>
                <p>It was ostensibly the most brutal meeting I've ever been at. Brezhnev spoke
                    first, followed by Kosygin and then Podgorny. Each one took about an hour and
                    just ranted and raved about Vietnam, the American bombing of Hanoi, and the
                    mining of the harbor of Haiphong. Somewhat to my surprise, President Nixon
                    hardly said anything. He just sat there and took it. What Nixon and Kissinger
                    realized, even more than we did, although we understood this was going to
                    happen, was that these statements by the Soviet leaders were essentially for the
                    record. The Russians, having welcomed Nixon to Moscow in the middle of our
                    bombing of Hanoi and the mining of Haiphong, had to show that they were tough.
                    They had to have a transcript that they could show to their North Vietnamese
                    friends, and this was all for show.</p>
                <p>President Nixon showed admirable self-restraint because the Soviet rhetoric was
                    really rather insulting. It was hot and heavy on this. This went on for about
                    three hours, as I say, and President Nixon barely responded. The meeting ended.
                    Then we went upstairs in the dacha, and immediately the mood changed completely.
                    It was 100 percent different. Brezhnev couldn't have been more jovial. They got
                    out the vodka and the caviar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko present at the
                        meeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0318" n="Page0318"/>
                <p>LORD: Gromyko was not at this meeting. As I said, Brezhnev was cracking jokes, as
                    was Soviet National Security Adviser Alexandrov. We went on for a couple of
                    hours. They were challenging us to drink more and more vodka, and everybody was
                    joking. It was essentially as if the meeting on Vietnam had never taken place.
                    The atmosphere was totally different, which underlined the fact that it was all
                    for show. It was the strangest change of mood that I've ever seen. We ate,
                    drank, and had a wonderful time. Then it turned out that we were due for some
                    further SALT negotiations that evening. Altogether, it was quite a day!</p>
                <p>Of course, the Russian people at this meeting didn't have to do the negotiating.
                    Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko was not at the meeting. He was going to do the
                    negotiating on SALT, along with their arms control people and their military
                    representatives, all of whom were sitting back in Moscow. Kissinger wasn't much
                    of a drinker. I suspect that the Soviets were not only having a happy time -
                    they wouldn't mind loosening up everyone on the U.S. side to get some final
                    concessions on arms control. We left this strange mood change and returned to
                    the Kremlin and had a late night session on the SALT negotiations. That was a
                    rather extraordinary experience.</p>
                <p>Overall, the summit meeting with the Russians was very successful. It was a
                    double header on top of the summit meeting with the Chinese which had preceded
                    it. The summit meeting with the Russians was important for our international
                    position and President Nixon's prestige in general, and the summit meeting with
                    the Russians helped Nixon to solidify his subsequent and overwhelming victory
                    against Senator McGovern [Democratic candidate for President in the 1972
                    elections]. That was going to happen as well. During the campaign we also made a
                    breakthrough on the Vietnam peace agreement. The election campaign of 1972 was
                    one of those few such campaigns in which foreign policy really was important. I
                    forget how Nixon stood domestically at this time, though most historians today
                    say he was surprisingly progressive on many issues.</p>
                <p>Senator McGovern was so extreme that many people thought that even though he
                    opposed the Vietnam war, they didn't want to go quite as far as McGovern went.
                    He was saying: “Come home, America,” an isolationist position which was too
                    extreme for the U.S. voters to accept. Just as Senator Goldwater was slaughtered
                    by President Johnson in the elections of 1964 because he was seen as extreme,
                    Senator McGovern was similarly and overwhelmingly defeated because he was seen
                    as extreme. Furthermore, President Nixon's foreign policy achievements were
                    considered quite extraordinary by then.</p>
                <p>In all fairness I am convinced that President Nixon engaged in these summit
                    meetings for reasons of the national interest and our international position,
                    not to ensure his reelection. He was not unaware of the fact that the meetings
                    would help him to be reelected. But he saw these meetings as being in the
                    America's interest and also saw them as part of his personal place in
                    history.</p>

                <p>Q: On this subject, what was our view of Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin and Foreign
                    Minister Gromyko in our contacts with the Soviets? I note that they did not
                    attend these talks. Did we have a feeling that this was a good cop, bad cop
                    routine?</p>
                <p>LORD: I can go into some profiles but, before I forget, there was onother
                    incident I want to mention. I'll move back in time temporarily.</p>
                <p>After the decision was made to bomb Hanoi and mine the harbor at Haiphong, there
                    had to be a speech explaining it. I recall, on a beautiful spring day, flying
                    with Kissinger on a helicopter up to Camp David, MD, to meet with President
                    Nixon and his speech writer to go over the speech. I remember being very
                    depressed at the time, as was Kissinger. Whatever the virtues of the tough
                    response to Hanoi, we felt that we were going to lose the summit meeting with
                    the Soviets. So we were joking, in the sense of gallows humor, about all the
                    work we had put in with the Russians going down the drain. Kissinger made some
                    comment to the effect that we could always save the rhetoric we had drafted for
                    future speeches. I said: “Yes, we can talk about the collapsed structure of
                    peace” as a result of this episode.</p>
                <p>So I remember going up to Camp David on this occasion and working with President
                    Nixon and his speech writer on that speech, explaining our tough response to
                    Hanoi. I felt very concerned about what was going to happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you catch any mood of the President's speech writers,
                        to theffect that: “By God, we're socking it to them?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: In this case it was not one of the top three speech writers. I believe that
                    it was a man named Andrews, who was primarily working on this speech for some
                    reason I've forgotten, although maybe one of the other speech writers took it
                    over after that. No, I don't recall any details about this case. Andrews just
                    carried out the instructions of the President in drafting the speech. I saw
                    Nixon briefly at Camp David. He clearly was in a resolute mood. He felt that we
                    had to do this. I can't recall specifically, during the brief encounter that
                    Kissinger and I had with Nixon, whether the President said that we were not
                    going to lose the summit meeting with the Russians anyway. But that was his
                    view.</p>
                <p>That was a memorable experience on a beautiful spring day, going from Washington
                    to Camp David, flying up on this helicopter and having this terrible feeling
                    that we were going to lose so many things as a result of the bombing of Hanoi
                    and Haiphong.</p>
                <pb facs="0320" n="Page0320"/>
                <p>Now, returning to the summit meeting with the Russians and the personalities.
                    Brezhnev, who sat in at the meeting with Nixon and Kissinger, was, of course,
                    completely different from the Chinese leaders. He was very mercurial in his
                    moods. He could be very tough and also could be very friendly. He could
                    literally give you a bear hug type of approach. He reminded me of a sort of
                    tough, labor leader. He was sort of earthy and didn't have the kind of elegance
                    that Zhou En-lai had, of course. He was much more easy to understand than Mao
                    Zedong who spoke elliptically and allusively..</p>
                <p>Brezhnev had a tendency to go on at great length in his statements, which used to
                    drive the interpreters wild, because he would speak very fast and go on for a
                    long time without pausing. It would be very tough for the interpreters to keep
                    up with him. It was also terrible for note taking because when the translation
                    was made, it might last for 20 minutes or half an hour. With Vietnamese,
                    Chinese, or Russian, you're much better off if the conversation involves going
                    back and forth between participants in brief paragraphs. That is easier to keep
                    up with. However, having to jot down notes for 20 or 30 minutes of a monologue
                    by Brezhnev was something else. Brezhnev could be quite friendly and then
                    menacing, as his moods changed. He was not above cracking some jokes. He would
                    sometimes get up from his chair and walk around as he spoke.</p>
                <p>I remember a famous exchange with Helmut Sonnenfeldt, in which he admired
                    Sonnenfeldt's watch, which was very expensive. It was probably a Rolex. Brezhnev
                    had a cheap watch. In effect, Brezhnev offered to trade wristwatches with
                    Sonnenfeldt. Of course, Sonnenfeldt couldn't say no to the President of the
                    Soviet Union. So Sonnenfeldt got in exchange some kind of cheap, Timex type
                    watch in exchange for a Rolex.</p>
                <p>Also, Brezhnev was trying to cut down on his smoking. He had a little device,
                    kind of like an alarm clock. He couldn't get at his cigarettes except every half
                    hour or hour. A little bell would go off, and he was then able to get out his
                    cigarettes. But he was always cheating and getting his cigarettes out early.</p>
                <p>So Brezhnev was a rough, tough guy in many ways, although he had a certain warmth
                    about him. It was clear that he was ruthless, as were the Chinese leaders.
                    However, he was very human and was not an elegant mandarin, like Zhou En-lai and
                    not like a Delphic emperor, as Mao Zedong was. He was more human in many
                    ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that Brezhnev was in command of the
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0321" n="Page0321"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes. I thought that he was in command, but you could never tell in Russia,
                    as in China, how much debate there was in the Politburo about going ahead. We
                    assumed that there were people, particularly on the military side, who were more
                    conservative and suspicious. So Brezhnev showed some courage in moving ahead
                    with det�nte. This didn't mean that he wasn't tough or ruthless, but it clearly
                    wasn't entirely easy for him to welcome President Nixon in the middle of our
                    bombing Hanoi and mining the harbor at Haiphong. Brezhnev had his own military
                    people suspicious of the arms control agreement he was negotiating with us. He
                    was dominant but not totally in charge like Mao.</p>
                <p>In 1972 and 1973, when I was on the U.S. delegation meetings with him, Brezhnev
                    was still strong and in pretty good form. As time went on, I didn't go to all of
                    the summit meetings, particularly as we entered the period of the Ford
                    administration. For example, I was not at the summit meeting at Vladivostok in
                    1975. Over time Brezhnev became physically weaker and mentally more sluggish. As
                    I saw Yeltsin's decline mentally and physically, it reminded me of Brezhnev,
                    hanging onto someone's arm, and also staying on longer than he should have.</p>
                <p>Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko was extremely impressive. Of all of the
                    foreign ministers I saw in action, he was one of the top three or four. Yaqub
                    Khan, Foreign Minister of Pakistan, who was Ambassador during part of the time I
                    was in government, was extremely impressive. Chao Quan-hua, the Vice Foreign
                    Minister of China, who ended up siding with the Gang of Four, was also quite
                    impressive. We met some very capable foreign ministers in the Middle East. Later
                    in my career (in the 1990s) Qian Qichen of China and Gareth Evans of Australia
                    were outstanding. Gromyko was very impressive indeed. He lived and served a long
                    time and had tremendous experience and great self confidence. He didn't have to
                    refer to his notes very often. He was on top of the issues, both strategically
                    and tactically. Unlike his general reputation, he had a good sense of humor.
                    Kissinger always tried to leaven his negotiations with Gromyko by telling jokes.
                    For example, I recall that when Kissinger would have a document in front of him,
                    he would joke with Gromyko and say: “I really would like to have another copy of
                    this document. I'll hold it up to your camera, which is in your chandelier,” or
                    something like that. They exchanged a lot of jokes like that. Or: “which of
                    these flower pots should I speak into?” Gromyko also had an amazing facility in
                    English. I'm sure that it was limited, but he could speak some phrases very
                    well. He was capable, in English, of using quadruple negatives in a sentence.
                    Not just a double negative. He would deliberately use a quadruple negative just
                    to have fun with it. You always think of Gromyko as being very dour and serious.
                    That was his public persona, and, of course, he could be that way in a
                    negotiation. However, he had a remarkable sense of humor at times. He and
                    Kissinger had a lot of light moments.</p>
                <p>Another Lord joke occurred when Peter Rodman and I were in a Kremlin men's room.
                    He said the setting reminded him of Ivan the Terrible. I said it reminded me of
                    Peter the Great.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0322" n="Page0322"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feeling about the relationship between
                        Gromyko anSoviet Ambassador Dobrynin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: We didn't see any differences between them. I wouldn't say that there was
                    any sign of one being a hard liner or any differences between, say, Ambassador
                    Dobrynin's approach to our relationship and that of Gromyko or Brezhnev. It
                    wasn't a good cop, bad cop situation. It didn't appear that one of them was
                    prepared to be more flexible than another.</p>
                <p>If you had to make a choice, of course, Ambassador Dobrynin was always searching
                    for ways to move ahead, but he could be very tough and very effective in
                    delivering a message, including the tough ones which he was instructed to
                    deliver by the Kremlin. There was no clear division between them, however,, nor
                    would any Russian envoy show daylight and keep his job. However, there were
                    times, I am sure, when Kissinger would meet with Ambassador Dobrynin, and they
                    would agree to explore on a personal basis possible contingencies or ways to
                    resolve a problem, even stretching their authority. I'm sure that Dobrynin took
                    some chances, and he probably didn't report all of this to Moscow. Kissinger
                    said some things that he wouldn't want to have appear in the transcript of his
                    meetings with Dobrynin. They met frequently, usually without anybody in the
                    State Department knowing about it. They were genuinely working to try to improve
                    the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States. However,
                    Dobrynin would reflect the Kremlin position, and there was no clear division
                    between him and the Soviet leaders. Dobrynin of course was one of the most
                    skillful and important (and lengthy) ambassadors of all time. His talks with
                    Kissinger over the years were historic.</p>
                <p>Nor could one really see any division between Gromyko and Brezhnev. Gromyko could
                    be very tough and very specific in his negotiating tactics. He would haggle, as
                    the Russians always did. However, there was no obvious difference between
                    Gromyko and Brezhnev. One wouldn't really expect that on the communist side.</p>
                <pb facs="0323" n="Page0323"/>
                <p>Speaking of diplomatic tactics, there were some very interesting moments. For
                    example, on the Middle East, Kissinger's strategy was to keep the Russians out
                    of any negotiations. He sought to show to the Arabs, as well as the Israelis,
                    that the United States was the indispensable nation that could deal with both
                    sides. We didn't want the Russians involved because this could dilute our
                    influence. Also, if the Russians were involved in a negotiation, they would be
                    sort of pro-Arab and turn out to be the advocates for their Arab friends. This
                    would sort of drive us into being advocates for Israel. Of course, we had
                    friendship with Israel and ties with it. We were going to help defend their
                    interests. However, if we were the only interlocutor, as we were in the Middle
                    East for years, we could be somewhat more even handed and could show more
                    genuine credentials to the Arab, as well as to the Israeli side. If the Russians
                    took part in these negotiations, it would have been more like four party
                    discussion. We would be with the Israelis on the one side, and the Russians
                    would be with the Arabs on the other. That would mean that we would have less
                    influence in the Arab world, where we had obvious interests, geopolitical as
                    well as in terms of energy and oil. We wanted to enhance our influence in the
                    Middle East with the Arabs, as well as to protect Israel.</p>
                <p>So we were constantly involved in meetings with the Russians, fending off their
                    getting involved in the Middle East. Kissinger would give the Russians
                    superficial briefings regarding his diplomacy in the Middle East. The Russians
                    would make proposals about the Russians and the U.S. getting together to work on
                    the Middle East, with the Russians intervening. Kissinger always tried to put
                    off inclusion of the Russians in discussing agenda items and make sure that we
                    would talk about other things. Then he would engage in tap dances of meaningless
                    rhetoric, giving the Russians superficial briefings just to keep them out of
                    ongoing discussions on the Middle East. It was a real high wire act that he was
                    putting on.</p>
                <p>One amusing footnote to this was the role of Peter Rodman. He was one of
                    Kissinger's staff aides, took notes during Kissinger's meetings, and also wrote
                    speeches and prepared correspondence for him. On one occasion we were sitting in
                    a meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko. Gromyko wanted some document
                    from us on the Middle East. Kissinger wanted to stall things, as always, on the
                    Middle East. This document was something that we actually had with us. Peter
                    Rodman had it. Kissinger wanted to pretend that we didn't have it, so that he
                    could gain another whole day and put the matter off for the next day. So
                    Kissinger turned to Rodman and said: “Have we got such-and-such a document?”
                    Rodman made the horrible mistake of saying enthusiastically: “Yes, we do. Here
                    it is,” and he thereupon handed it over. Kissinger was really annoyed. Rodman
                    was supposed to stall, knowing our general stalling strategy, and say: “No, we
                    don't have it.”</p>
                <p>I recall that a day or two later Kissinger turned to me for some document, which
                    wasn't on the Middle East. I decided to have some fun with this. Kissinger said:
                    “Lord, have you got this document?” I said: “I don't know, Henry, what's the
                    right answer?” So we had our amusing moments.</p>
                <pb facs="0324" n="Page0324"/>
                <p>I can't say much about the other Russians. Brezhnev, Gromyko, and Dobrynin are
                    the only ones that I had much contact with. Ambassador Dobrynin in particular
                    has to be regarded as one of the stars in diplomacy. Certainly, he was the
                    single most impressive Ambassador that I dealt with in this period, when I was
                    in the White House and then at the State Department. He deserves great credit
                    for moving the U.S. - Russian relationship along. He stayed within his
                    instructions, but to the extent that he could devise ways to move ahead around
                    the edges, without getting himself in trouble in Moscow, he would do that. He
                    survived as Soviet Ambassador to the United States for an awfully long time and
                    deserves credit for doing so. Of course, he's written his own memoirs.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you feel that the Soviet desk in the Bureau of European Affairs was well
                    plugged into what was happening, or was all of this going on around them?</p>
                <p>LORD: During the NSC period (1969-73), it was pretty much like relations with
                    China and Vietnam. Relations with the Soviet Union were run out of the White
                    House. Now, this doesn't mean that we didn't draw on expertise from the State
                    Department for background purposes. I can't recall, during the summit meetings
                    with the Russians, who would sit in from the State Department, or whether this
                    was handled only by members of the NSC staff, like relations with China. It
                    seems to me that the exclusion of the State Department wasn't quite as complete
                    as was the case with China, where we only had people from the NSC, led by
                    Kissinger, dealing with Zhou En-lai and Mao. In negotiations with the Chinese,
                    Secretary of State Rogers was limited to handling bilateral economic and
                    cultural issues with the Chinese foreign minister. The negotiations with Zhou
                    En-lai and his subordinates on the Shanghai Communique and other issues were
                    strictly handled by the NSC, including me. I don't think that the manner of
                    handling Soviet-American issues in Moscow was quite so closed off from the State
                    Department, but I can't be sure. But surely the principal day-to-day conduct of
                    bilateral relations and the preparation for the summit were strictly
                    Kissinger-Dobrynin/Gromyko affairs.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you see a difference between Kissinger's behavior at the Soviet summit
                    meeting and the way he dealt with the China summit meetings?</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, as I've said already, we had different negotiating styles with the
                    Russians and with the Chinese. You have to remember that in dealing with the
                    Russians we had real, substantive, concrete business to handle, including arms
                    control, trade agreements, the supply of grain, Berlin negotiations, and
                    scientific and space agreements. There were also questions involving our
                    contacts with the Soviet Union around the world. We talked to the Soviet Union
                    about the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and other places.</p>
                <pb facs="0325" n="Page0325"/>
                <p>With the Chinese we were beginning with a sort of tableau rasa [clean slate]. We
                    were just starting out on a brand new relationship after 25 years of mutual
                    isolation and enmity. The Chinese didn't threaten us as much as the Soviets did,
                    nor were they adventurists. They didn't have that kind of power. Our
                    conversations were mostly rhetorical and conceptual with the Chinese. At this
                    point, in the early 1970s, there weren't a lot of agreements or specific
                    negotiations. Our discussions mostly involved strategic matters of trying to
                    figure out how China and the U.S. could deal with the Russians. We would also
                    talk about Vietnam, the Middle East, Korea, and other issues. However, we
                    weren't negotiating real agreements.</p>
                <p>We had a different kind of agenda with the two countries. With the Chinese,
                    Kissinger was much more philosophical, conceptual, strategic, and reflective,
                    which he was brilliant at, as was Zhou En-lai. In their discussions with
                    Kissinger and American officials, aside from President Nixon, Gromyko and the
                    other Russians, along with Ambassador Dobrynin and President Brezhnev, tended to
                    be much more concrete and specific and were interested in genuine negotiations
                    on specific issues, as well as discussing positions more broadly.</p>
                <p>Finally, I would say, and it was true then and it's true to this day, without
                    being pejorative, Kissinger liked dealing with the Chinese better than he liked
                    dealing with the Russians. Some people would argue that Kissinger and President
                    Nixon, as well as other, subsequent Republican and Democratic Secretaries of
                    State, National Security Advisers, and Presidents, have been somewhat seduced by
                    the Chinese, that they haven't been tough enough with them. I'll leave that for
                    the historians, but the fact is that Mao Zedong and Zhou En-lai were extremely
                    impressive, more impressive than the Russians. They were more exciting and
                    pleasing to talk to. Secondly, in Kissinger's view Russia was seen as much more
                    of a threat to us than the Chinese. Thirdly, the cultural and negotiating styles
                    of the Russians and the Chinese were different. In effect, the Chinese would
                    say: “Now, what do you need? Here's what we need. Here are some basic
                    principles, and how do we get there?” They would not change their bottom line
                    very frequently or haggle like rug merchants. The Russians were much more
                    traditional. Initially, they inflated their positions, asking for more than they
                    really needed, expecting us to do the same. Then we would bargain toward the
                    middle position. This was a much more exhausting and tiresome exercise.</p>
                <pb facs="0326" n="Page0326"/>
                <p>Fourth, rightly or wrongly, Kissinger felt that the Chinese were more trustworthy
                    than the Russians, that the Chinese would uphold agreements, while the Russians
                    would push the envelope, try to haggle around the edges, and not live up to the
                    spirit and, perhaps, even the letter of the agreement. For example, in terms of
                    translations, we negotiated the Shanghai Communique in English. We really - and
                    this was irresponsible - did not go over the Chinese version of the communique
                    closely until the summit meeting was already over and we had returned to
                    Washington. When we looked at the Chinese language version of the Shanghai
                    Communique, our experts concluded that, not only were the Chinese faithful to
                    the English language version of the communique, but there were a couple of
                    places where they could have chosen one, two, or three options in terms of what
                    Chinese word to use and they regularly chose the word that was more favorable to
                    us than to them. Kissinger thought that the Chinese had the vision to see that,
                    as he said, rather than picking up loose change and trying to get some tiny,
                    little tactical advantage by a translation change or not fully living up to
                    something, they were more interested in gaining our sense of trust and
                    credibility in implementing the agreements, a longer-term payoff. He felt that
                    in this way they sought to earn a more flexible and understanding U.S. approach
                    by taking the high road. By contrast there were times when the Russians actually
                    screwed up the translation and then tried to work the resulting situation to
                    their advantage. Or they would haggle and press around the edges.</p>
                <p>So when you put all of these four or five factors together which I have
                    mentioned, as a result Kissinger felt more friendly toward the Chinese than he
                    did toward the Russians. This didn't mean that he didn't want to improve
                    relations with Russia. However, he basically felt that the Chinese were easier
                    to deal with and more trustworthy than the Russians, not that the Chinese
                    weren't tough and acting in their own self interest.</p>
                <p>That situation has continued to this day. In my view, Kissinger continues to give
                    the Chinese the benefit of the doubt and to be suspicious of the Russians. He
                    has always felt that the Russians will come back some day with their
                    expansionist activities, as they did under the Czars and under the Communists.
                    Therefore, he believes that we have to be careful about a resurgent, Russian
                    nationalism. Similarly, Kissinger has always tended to be suspicious, to some
                    degree, of Japanese militarism, and even of the Indians, to a certain extent,
                    whereas the Chinese get more of a free pass from Kissinger. In answer to your
                    question, these tendencies were seen even back then.</p>
                <p>There are two other reasons which come to mind, I think, why Kissinger felt a
                    greater affinity with the Chinese than with the Russians. It is a little ironic,
                    since Kissinger himself is a European and, to a certain extent, a Russian
                    expert, much more than an Asian specialist. He didn't really know anything about
                    the Chinese until we opened up relations with them.</p>
                <p>First, of course, the Chinese are much more subtle than the Russians. You can see
                    this symbolically in their food. There is a subtlety and variety in Chinese
                    food, compared to the heavy, somewhat repetitive, Russian food.</p>
                <pb facs="0327" n="Page0327"/>
                <p>You can also see this in their style of protocol. The Chinese are masters at
                    making you feel at home when you're their guest, inducing a sense of obligation
                    in you by treating you well. They are very clever in how they conduct
                    themselves. For example, in terms of sightseeing, we always used to marvel that
                    when we went sightseeing in China to a series of exhibits or museums or trips to
                    various places in the course of a day, we would often linger at various places
                    and take longer than we figured the Chinese had planned for. Yet we would get
                    through the entire tour on time, without feeling rushed. The secret was that on
                    a sightseeing tour the Chinese would divide the planned schedule into, let us
                    say, 15-minute segments. They never rushed the visitor. If the visitor was
                    taking longer than they planned on at, let us say, some exhibit in a museum,
                    they would just cut out the next 15 minute segment and go on to the following
                    portion of the program. We wouldn't know that something had been cut out of the
                    program. They would let us go at our own pace, yet we always got back to our
                    guest quarters right on time and without feeling rushed, feeling that we had
                    seen everything that we were supposed to see. By contrast, the Russians would
                    tend to hurry you along in any tour. The second reason, and it's related to
                    this, why Kissinger felt more affinity to the Chinese than to the Russians, was
                    the matter of self-confidence. The Chinese knew that they had been the number
                    one power in the world for 4,000 or 5,000 years. They were the Middle Kingdom.
                    Everyone else was either a barbarian or far distant from them. If they were
                    located closer to the Chinese, they were tributary peoples, and China was
                    dominant. China was Number One in the world technologically and in many other
                    ways, up until about the 17th century. Then the Chinese began to lag and they
                    had a bad century or two when they were exploited by the British, invaded by the
                    Japanese, and humiliated by other, outside powers in the 19th and 20th
                    centuries. As a result there is a curious mixture of self-confidence and
                    arrogance because the Chinese have this awareness of having been the Middle
                    Kingdom for so long. At the same time, they are also thin skinned and xenophobic
                    because of the rape of Nanking in 1937 by the Japanese or the Opium War of the
                    19th century by the British, and so forth.</p>
                <p>On balance the Chinese, when they look at their history and culture, are very
                    much aware that they were the Number One power for the great bulk of their
                    history. They figure that they will be Number One in the next century or the one
                    after that. As a result, the Chinese have a certain self-confidence, which means
                    that they can act in a more relaxed and less haggling, nervous, and paranoid
                    way, whereas the Russians have a much greater mix in their history in terms of
                    how they've done. The Russians see themselves as threatened historically and
                    perhaps in the future on the East by the Chinese and the Japanese, and on the
                    West by Europe and the U.S. They have less self confidence in the way they deal
                    with us. This is reflected in everything from haggling over details of a program
                    as to how they handle their translations. I would add these factors to why
                    Kissinger was drawn more to the Chinese than to the Russians.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that Bill Hyland and Helmut Sonnenfeldt almost had to gang up on
                    Kissinger to get him to pay more attention to these cultural aspects of dealing
                    with the Soviet Union? How did they deal with Kissinger regarding the Soviet
                    Union?</p>
                <pb facs="0328" n="Page0328"/>
                <p>LORD: No, I didn't see any problem there. There might be some disagreements on
                    specific tactics, such as what to do on arms control, Berlin, or something like
                    that. However, Kissinger gave extremely high priority to our relationship with
                    Russia. Because we had more specific business with the Russians by far than we
                    did with the Chinese, he spent more hours working on Russia than with China. No
                    question about that. Russia, after all, presented the major challenge to
                    American foreign policy for the past 30, 40, or 50 years. Kissinger treated it
                    as such.</p>
                <p>So, when I was on the NSC staff during the period 1969-1973, I noticed that he
                    spent more time on Russia than on any other, single issue. He obviously spent a
                    great deal of time on China, as well, in addition to the Middle East, to a
                    certain extent. However, Russia was the overwhelming problem together with
                    Vietnam. It was never difficult to draw his attention to Russia. This didn't
                    mean that Nixon, Kissinger, and their key advisers would always agree. However,
                    I think that there was a general agreement among us on the basic approach to be
                    adopted toward the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>In his latest book of memoirs, and I've already dipped into it, Kissinger goes
                    over this argument by the neo-conservatives that he was too soft on the
                    Russians. Today it seems a little ironic that some people may think that
                    Kissinger was too soft on the Communists. The concept of det�nte ran into some
                    trouble because it was attacked on the Left and on the Right. I'll get back to
                    that later. To answer your question more directly, no, it was never difficult to
                    draw Kissinger's attention to Russia. The question of Russia always drew the
                    attention of Kissinger and his key advisers.</p>
                <p>I was involved in these matters myself but I want to make clear that I was always
                    much more in a supporting role, preparing briefing papers and so on. I was there
                    mostly to give a global perspective, to compare what we were doing with China
                    and Vietnam, as well as to help out on the note-taking. I also did some drafting
                    of documents.</p>
                <p>Let me spend just a couple of minutes on the evolution of our policies toward the
                    Soviet Union. As I said, we had this mixed bag of issues in 1969 and 1970. We
                    were not really moving ahead. Then there was a dramatic acceleration of
                    relations with the Soviet Union in the wake of the announcement in July, 1971,
                    that Kissinger had visited China. Having opened relations with China we were
                    able to move ahead with the Russians.</p>

                <p>When Nixon was reelected in 1972, we seemed poised to be in excellent shape in
                    foreign policy, for the following reasons. First, we had a President who had won
                    a crushing victory in the elections of 1972 and had an overwhelming mandate from
                    the American people. Of course, this strengthened his position abroad, because
                    he had been reelected by such a large margin. Secondly, since he had been
                    reelected for a second term, President Nixon wouldn't have to be concerned about
                    domestic politics and could do what he wanted to do in terms of foreign policy,
                    essentially because he could not run for reelection. So he could be even more
                    statesmanlike. Thirdly, he had some very significant successes. We had the
                    opening of relations with China and we had detente with the Russians and the
                    specific agreements negotiated with the Russians in the areas that I've
                    mentioned. By January, 1973, shortly after his reelection, we reached a Vietnam
                    peace agreement and were beginning to be active in shuttle diplomacy in the
                    Middle East. As a result, President Nixon and Kissinger both felt very good
                    about where we stood as we headed into Nixon's second term as President.</p>
                <p>Much more attention could now be paid to our allies and other issues. There was a
                    turning to the year of Europe and the strengthening of our trans-Atlantic
                    relations. Clearly, there was going to be more focus on the Middle East than
                    there had been. We could begin to pay more attention to the Western Hemisphere,
                    to economic and energy problems, and to the Third World more generally,
                    includinAfrica. All of these matters were in Nixon's and Kissinger's eyes as
                    issues that we could pay much more attention to in the second Nixon term. During
                    the first term, attention was focused on problems of relations with the
                    Communist countries, as well as the Vietnam War, which Nixon felt that he had to
                    settle on what he considered an honorable basis. He wanted to free himself up,
                    not only to deal with domestic debate and distractions, but also to pay greater
                    attention to how we were spending our resources on diplomacy more generally
                    throughout the world.</p>
                <p>Detente with the Russians had obviously been more urgent because of the danger
                    coming from the global relationship with the Soviet Union, which was the single,
                    most important issue on which we had to move forward. That was moving ahead,
                    with the summit meeting with the Russians, and so on. Of course, there was also
                    the opening of relations with China, which helped President Nixon on all fronts.
                    This was a dramatic development in and of itself. We also had the impact, for
                    the American people, of easing the Vietnam trauma. Clearly, any settlement of
                    the Vietnam War was going to be less than perfect. It had some dangers in it,
                    and we later saw it unravel for a variety of reasons which I have discussed
                    elsewhere.</p>
                <pb facs="0330" n="Page0330"/>
                <p>We were extricating ourselves from Vietnam with, at best, an inconclusive
                    outcome; it certainly wasn't a clear-cut victory in either material or moral
                    terms like what we had at the end of World War II. For the American people this
                    outcome could be put in perspective, because simultaneously with that were these
                    other, major moves toward the Russians but, above all, toward the Chinese. We
                    were now dealing with China, the world's most populous nation and a very
                    important one. It was going to be an even bigger country in the 21st century.
                    With this dramatic, new opening, the American people, whether explicitly or
                    implicitly, could see and recognize that this historic move dwarfed in some ways
                    an inconclusive outcome in Vietnam, a small part of Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>So for all of these reasons we were poised to move ahead with our foreign policy,
                    while continuing our momentum on other fronts. We could deal with our allies
                    more systematically on all of the other issues that I mentioned. We could tackle
                    a much broader diplomatic agenda.</p>
                <p>Well, of course, what none of us knew, and even President Nixon didn't know, as
                    of January 27, 1973, when the Vietnam Agreement was signed, was that the
                    Watergate Affair was going to undermine all of this. So, in addition to all of
                    the tragedies about the Watergate Affair, which we could discuss but which wiser
                    men who were more directly involved in it than I could better discuss, certainly
                    the impact on our foreign policy was momentous. As this issue wore on in 1973
                    and 1974, and as President Nixon became more and more preoccupied with it, he
                    paid less and less attention to foreign policy. His leverage abroad was reduced
                    as people saw him in trouble. So our momentum in the field of foreign policy
                    slowed down with Russia and China. The North Vietnamese, of course, broke the
                    Vietnam Agreement of January, 1973, and that settlement unraveled.</p>
                <p>We still managed to move ahead on certain fronts, and you have to give Kissinger
                    credit for great skill in working against this backdrop of deteriorating
                    executive authority, as a result of the Watergate Affair and Vietnam. Arranging
                    two agreements with the Egyptians and one with the Syrians in the Middle East
                    were real achievements. I was involved in the shuttle diplomacy in connection
                    with negotiating the two Egyptian agreements. We moved ahead on issues like
                    energy. In Southern Africa, we pressed negotiations regarding Rhodesia, and this
                    began to move the continent of Africa toward majority rule. There were other
                    efforts made as well, and I'll talk about this when we discuss the State
                    Department Policy Planning Staff, which I headed, in our next session.</p>
                <pb facs="0331" n="Page0331"/>
                <p>The point is that this effort during the late Nixon and Ford Administrations was
                    essentially a holding action. During this period, from 1974 to the beginning of
                    1977, which covered the Ford administration, one of Kissinger's greatest
                    contributions was to make sure that our overall foreign policy position did not
                    collapse, despite the negative impact on executive authority as a result of
                    Vietnam, the Watergate Affair, the transition from Nixon to Ford, and a host of
                    new restrictive Congressional actions. There is no question that these great
                    hopes that we had in January, 1973, and for the reasons I mentioned, were
                    damaged seriously by the Watergate episode, above all.</p>
                <p>It wasn't just a matter of one President being removed from office and under
                    attack before he was removed which complicated our efforts. Also involved was
                    the fact that Congress began passing all kinds of legislation and getting more
                    and more involved in foreign policy, in reaction to the Watergate affair and the
                    perceived excesses of the Nixon administration. Congressional attitudes also
                    changed in reaction to the Vietnam War. The War Powers Act and the Jackson-Vanik
                    Amendment on trade with Russia were passed. There was a series of legislative
                    initiatives which made it much harder for President Nixon and Kissinger to
                    conduct our foreign policy. There was a Congressional backlash and
                    micro-management of foreign policy setting in. These tendencies greatly
                    complicated our efforts.</p>
                <p>I think that I'll save until later the consequences for policy planning, unless
                    you think I should cover this now as part of the discussion of our relations
                    with Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that we can do it now, if you wish.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: All right, we can continue our discussion of our relations with Russia. As
                    part of the impact of the Watergate affair and of Congressional micro-management
                    of foreign policy, the U.S.-Russian relationship began to slow down and run into
                    trouble, during this period from 1973 to 1975. It wasn't a dramatic, overnight
                    process, but clearly the momentum slowed down. It slowed down because we were
                    losing both our sticks and our carrots, for a variety of reasons.</p>
                <p>On the conservative side in Congress, including the neo conservatives like the
                    late Senator Jackson [Democrat, Washington state] a much higher value was placed
                    on ideology. This included the treatment of Jews in the Soviet Union and
                    generally elements of the unattractive ideological and domestic system of
                    communism. Kissinger was more concerned about external behavior by the Russians.
                    His constant emphasis was on how countries deal with the situation outside their
                    borders, and he didn't spend as much time worrying about what countries do
                    inside their borders. Senator Jackson in particular and Richard Perle, his staff
                    aid, and others were constraining our use of carrots for the Soviet Union.</p>
                <pb facs="0332" n="Page0332"/>
                <p>They undercut the negotiations on SALT [Strategic Arms Limitation Talks] and
                    sometimes interplayed with people within the Ford administration, such as James
                    Schlesinger and Donald Rumsfeld, from whom they might get some help. So movement
                    in the arms control negotiations with the Russians was slowing down, due to
                    attacks coming from the Right in Congress and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>We were also trying to open up more normal trade relations with the Russians.
                    This was intended to provide the Russians with incentives to get economic help
                    through cooperation with us. But the Jackson-Vanik Amendment affected trade
                    relations with the Russians, restricting most favored nation status until there
                    was a specific number of Jews allowed to emigrate from the Soviet Union.
                    Kissinger would argue that the Jackson-Vanik amendment didn't work very well. We
                    got more Jews out of Russia through quiet diplomacy than we did after the
                    amendment was passed. This amendment also screwed up our economic relations more
                    generally with the Russians. So the impact of both the trade and arms control
                    carrots was accordingly limited.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, our use of the sticks was being restrained by the liberals in
                    Congress, most of them Democrats. Specifically, the defense budget was being cut
                    sharply, particularly in reaction to the Vietnam War. Investigations of the CIA
                    [Central Intelligence Agency], some of which were legitimate, were under way.
                    There were resulting constraints on our defense and intelligence communities.
                    The immediate post-Vietnam licking-of-wounds fed self-doubt about our world role
                    and willingness to intervene overseas. So these potential sticks in our
                    relations with the Russians, were also under attack.</p>
                <p>As a result, we had few carrots and sticks available which we had hoped to use as
                    a part of our strategy on det�nte to move our relations with the Russians ahead.
                    The Russians could see that President Nixon was under attack. They never could
                    understand, any more than many of our European friends, why the Watergate affair
                    was visibly bringing down the President. They saw this affair as a second rate
                    burglary, just as, more recently, some people have not been able to understand
                    why sex scandals [involving President Clinton] should have had the potential of
                    forcing him from office. So for all of these reasons the Russians didn't deal
                    with us as effectively as we had hoped, and we couldn't deal with them
                    effectively, either. We couldn't threaten them as much and we couldn't induce
                    them as much to move ahead in our bilateral relations.</p>
                <pb facs="0333" n="Page0333"/>
                <p>To his credit, Kissinger nevertheless maintained our relations with the Soviet
                    Union so that they didn't deteriorate. More and more he had to do this himself,
                    because President Nixon was preoccupied with the consequences of the Watergate
                    Affair. President Ford helped to improve our relations with the Soviet Union.
                    The Vladivostok summit meeting was held when President Ford was in office. We
                    managed to inch ahead with the Russians. At least we didn't go backward. That
                    was of some significance, but it meant that during Nixon's second term we were
                    unable to continue to make the kind of advances that we had achieved during the
                    first Nixon term.</p>
                <p>Part of the reason for this trend was that conservatives, particularly in
                    Congress, were concerned about the Soviet domestic system. This affected the
                    carrots we had hoped to use. Part of the reason was that liberals, especially in
                    Congress, were concerned about alleged American excesses in foreign policy and
                    were taking away the sticks we had hoped to use.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find your own position affected by these developments? Were you
                    isolated from, say, the staffs of the Foreign Relations and Foreign Affairs
                    Committees of Congress?</p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. I had no dealings with Congress when I was on the NSC [National
                    Security Council] staff, and that was true of just about all of the NSC staff
                    members. Any dealings with Congress at that point were essentially handled by
                    Kissinger and Al Haig, his deputy. I was a Special Assistant to Kissinger at the
                    time. However, I don't believe that even the experts on the NSC staff like
                    Helmut Sonnenfeldt, John Holdridge, Hal Saunders on the Middle East, or Bob
                    Hormats on economic affairs, or before him, Fred Bergstren, dealt much with
                    Congress, either. That was generally handled by the domestic Congressional
                    liaison people, plus people like Kissinger and Al Haig, personally.</p>
                <p>In subsequent administrations, this has no longer been true. Certainly now, NSC
                    staff members deal a lot with Congressional staffers. However, at the time we
                    didn't deal much with Congress directly. This was largely due to Nixon and
                    Kissinger's desire for control and cohesion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Helsinki Accords during this time? Were you
                        at alinvolved with that, and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. Again, that also included my time on the Policy Planning Staff in the
                    State Department. I'm trying to follow the Soviet thread here. The Helsinki
                    Accords had to do with the CSCE [Conference on Security and Cooperation in
                    Europe]. The basic agreement ratified existing European borders but also put
                    human rights on the agenda as a legitimate issue for discussion between East and
                    West. The third basket under the Helsinki Accord [different subjects were
                    grouped together in so-called baskets] involved trade and cultural
                    exchanges.</p>
                <pb facs="0334" n="Page0334"/>
                <p>Kissinger might have a different view on this, but I distinctly remember him as
                    being initially suspicious of the Helsinki Accords. First, he wasn't quite sure
                    that ratification of existing borders was something that was necessarily a good
                    idea and might face a domestic challenge by hard liners in the U.S. body
                    politic. Secondly, he has never been one to be that much concerned about human
                    rights as part of our foreign policy. Therefore, the human rights basket didn't
                    appeal to him so much. He has since recognized more the salience of human
                    rights, and at that time he may even have said that he was in favor of human
                    rights. I'll leave it to him to debate that.</p>
                <p>In fact, the human rights basket was very important, and historians now generally
                    agree that the Helsinki Accords definitely worked to the advantage of the West.
                    The Helsinki Accords legitimized human rights as a point for discussion between
                    East and West. This doesn't mean that the Russians would simply roll over on
                    human rights, but whether it involved Czechoslovakia, Hungary, or other Eastern
                    European countries, as well as the Soviet Union itself, human rights became a
                    more legitimate item on which to make attacks on their record and to make
                    appeals for improvement. Also it gave a certain, international cover and
                    legitimacy to dissidents within these nations. This was one of many situations
                    which contributed to the unraveling of the Soviet Union. Other areas included
                    their economic problems and the fact that they were stretched by Star Wars,
                    Reagan's defense budget, and advancing defense technology on which they were
                    forced to spend increasing portions of the Soviet budget. In addition, the
                    rottenness of the Soviet system was also a factor, as well as the human rights
                    question. So the Helsinki Accords turned out to be very much of a factor serving
                    the interests of the West.</p>
                <p>And you have to give Kissinger credit for the reasons I mentioned. Kissinger
                    never really opposed the Helsinki Accords, but I think that he didn't realize
                    how useful a tool they were going to be against the Soviet Union and how much
                    they were in our interest. I think that Kissinger was ambivalent about them.</p>

                        baskets,and all of that, at an early stage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, we were involved peripherally but not essentially. I'll get into the
                    Policy Planning Staff agenda later. I don't think that we had a major role to
                    play in that. I wasn't really involved. I went on about half of the trips with
                    Kissinger when he was Secretary of State, but not all of them. I was no longer
                    directly involved in negotiations with Russia.</p>
                <p>Q: When you were dealing at this point with matters affecting the Soviet Union,
                    did you see it as an aggressive empire or as an aggressive power? Did you think
                    that we had to be concerned about sitting on it? That is, firming up the borders
                    around it or trying to prevent the Soviet Union from reaching out to Africa,
                    Latin America, and so forth?</p>
                <pb facs="0335" n="Page0335"/>
                <p>LORD: I don't think that I had a view much different from the views of Kissinger,
                    Sonnenfeldt or Hyland on this. I regarded the Soviet Union as a fundamental
                    threat to U.S. interests. I don't think that we lacked confidence. I think that
                    we felt that we were much stronger than the Russians in most respects. However,
                    a fundamental consideration was that, above all, their nuclear capability was
                    essentially equal to ours. How great it really amounted to was frequently
                    exaggerated, but it really didn't matter. It was large enough to be a matter of
                    grave concern to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At a certain point, the difference was really not
                        significant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Even a more modest Soviet nuclear capability would have been a great threat
                    to the United States. Obviously, the Soviet nuclear dimension and their ability
                    to push the envelope internationally was a matter of concern to us. Remember
                    that the Soviet Union had proclaimed the Brezhnev Doctrine in 1968, after the
                    Prague Spring. By the way, this was one thing that really concerned the Chinese.
                    In effect, the Brezhnev Doctrine said that the Russians had the right to
                    determine the domestic system of other, socialist countries. That got the
                    attention of the Chinese, along with the border clashes with the Russians along
                    the Sino-Soviet border on the Ussuri River opposite Manchuria.</p>
                <p>So, for all of these reasons we all felt that we had to be firm with the
                    Russians, we had to maintain a strong defense, and we needed to exert some
                    pressure in order to get the Russians' attention, given the way they negotiate
                    and their history. Whether they deployed missiles in Cuba during the Kennedy
                    administration, established a submarine base in Cuba [in Cienfuegos], encouraged
                    radical Arabs, or fooled around with the access routes to Berlin, we felt that
                    we had to react strongly to what we regarded as Soviet provocations.</p>
                <p>At the same time, I agreed with the Nixon-Kissinger approach that, in addition to
                    firmness, we had to give the Soviets some incentives to develop a better
                    relationship with us. As long as we made clear that the Soviets couldn't push us
                    around, we also had to make clear that we weren't out to dominate Russia or
                    overthrow their regime and that we were prepared to respect them as a major
                    power. We were prepared to have a more normal relationship with Russia, as far
                    as arms control, trade, and other exchanges were concerned. We were also
                    prepared to negotiate with them on subjects of mutual interest to our two
                    countries. I think that this combination of incentives and pressures reflected
                    our view of the Russians. We thought that they wouldn't be irrational if we gave
                    them an option that would be more attractive. However, we had to be firm so that
                    they wouldn't be tempted toward adventurism.</p>
                <pb facs="0336" n="Page0336"/>
                <p>Kissinger and Nixon came under attack for appearing to be soft on the Soviets.
                    Their view was that we had to have a closely linked position, whether this
                    involved trying to maintain a strong defense and intelligence capability,
                    despite attacks from Congress, whether it involved resisting the Soviets in the
                    many crises that I've mentioned, or whether it was just plain, tough
                    negotiations. This above all, we were not soft. But, beyond that, Kissinger and
                    Nixon felt that an all-out confrontation with the Soviets would, of course, be
                    very dangerous in the nuclear age. It could cause strains with our allies, and
                    could cause some problems domestically. We felt that if we were ever going to
                    have a major confrontation with the Russians, we had to have demonstrated to the
                    American people, the Congress, and other countries around the world that we had
                    tried to be more reasonable and had tried to have a more normal relationship
                    with the Russians. We needed to demonstrate that this confrontation was forced
                    upon us by unrelenting Soviet adventurism, as opposed to our prematurely going
                    into dangerous confrontations. Such confrontations would not only be dangerous;
                    we might not have the necessary allied and domestic support because we had not
                    tried to follow a more flexible approach.</p>
                <p>I'm sure that Nixon and Kissinger would argue that they recognized that the
                    Soviets were not all that strong. The Soviets were certainly dangerous, but,
                    over the long haul, we sought to buy time and wear them down by pursuing a
                    policy of containment of Russia and also seeking better relations with them.
                    Over time. Nixon and Kissinger believed, the Soviet system would collapse or
                    erode, as George Kennan himself had suggested in his famous article in “Foreign
                    Affairs” magazine in the late 1940s. He used the pseudonym of “X” for the
                    article.</p>
                <p>By far the most exhaustive rationale for detente and review of the record in
                    U.S.-Soviet relations was provided in the summer of 1974. Together with the
                    experts I worked very hard on what was basically a White Paper, and background
                    for congressional hearings. It was a very eloquent document, but received very
                    little attention because Watergate was coming to a climax.</p>
                <p>Nixon and Kissinger felt that Senator Jackson, the neo-conservatives, and others,
                    shared the strategic approach of containing the Russians, which they all agreed
                    upon. But Nixon and Kissinger felt that the tactics of Senator Jackson and
                    others were ill-considered, were overly confrontational, and could provoke a
                    crisis and lose domestic support. They felt that it was necessary to play for
                    the long run by being reasonable as well as firm at the same time. Kissinger
                    felt that Jackson and his staff, e.g., Richard Perle, working with allies like
                    Schlesinger and Rumsfeld, kept undermining our Soviet policy. In one example
                    their attacks on arms control agreements being worked out with the Soviets in
                    Vladivostok in November 1974 sunk them. By the time Kissinger got back to
                    Washington, after visiting China, the debate was lost.</p>
                <pb facs="0337" n="Page0337"/>
                <p>Part of the trouble that Kissinger ran into in the field of foreign affairs
                    during the years of the Ford administration was his underestimation of the
                    desire of our people and Congress to reflect values in our foreign policy.
                    Fairly or unfairly, the American people aren't used to the concept of the
                    balance of power or the European approach to diplomacy anyway, which Kissinger
                    thrived on as an historian, and to this day remains his basic view of the world.
                    The American people and Congress felt that there had to be a human component,
                    that other countries' domestic systems were relevant, and that human rights was
                    a subject to which we had to pay attention. Therefore, Kissinger encountered
                    criticism from the Right that we weren't doing enough to bring about change in
                    the Soviet domestic system of government, even as the Left was saying that we
                    were being too tough in trying to affect Soviet external behavior. The Left too
                    was concerned about human rights. So Kissinger was attacked from both ends of
                    the political spectrum, as I mentioned before, diluting this combination of
                    sticks and carrots. That's why det�nte ran into considerable trouble.</p>
                <p>Q: Incidentally, I'm not sure whether this reflects an age difference. I keep
                    referring to the Soviets, and you keep referring to Russians.</p>
                <p>LORD: We ought to say Soviets until they reached the downfall of thSoviet Union
                    in 1991.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm a Cold War type myself. Of course, you were
                        also.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Soviets is a better term for the government of the former Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feeling that the Soviet empire was
                        vulnerable, or was there a feeling that, while this might be true, this
                        would become a real consideration so far in the future that it didn't really
                        amount to a strategic opening.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. That's a fair point. I don't think that Nixon and Kissinger greatly
                    exaggerated Soviet strength. However, along with almost everybody else that I
                    knew, except maybe Senator Moynihan [Democrat, New York], I think that I - and
                    they - didn't realize how vulnerable the Soviets really were, because of their
                    terrible economic system, not to mention their authoritarian style of
                    government.</p>
                <pb facs="0338" n="Page0338"/>
                <p>Going all the way back to where President Kennedy exaggerated the missile gap,
                    there was a constant practice in the United States of overestimating just how
                    strong the Soviets were. I think, to his credit, that President Reagan
                    instinctively understood, better than his predecessors, that there really was a
                    vulnerable weakness in the Soviet system. He felt that he could stretch the
                    Soviet Union by our own defense spending and firmness, even as he tried to
                    negotiate with the Soviets, with the help of Secretary of State George Shultz,
                    who, I think, was very important in that respect. I think that Nixon and
                    Kissinger felt that the Soviet Union was a stronger empire and a stronger
                    country than, in retrospect, it really was. But in all fairness, no matter how
                    weak the Soviet Union was in economic or other terms, it was a real danger
                    because of its formidable nuclear capability which could obliterate us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know that they also had an awful lot of tanks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's right, in terms of all of the scenarios on Europe, the Soviets were
                    considered to have overwhelming strength in conventional weapons. We were at
                    least their equals in terms of nuclear arms, although there were different views
                    on this subject. Certainly, Nixon and Kissinger would not have predicted that
                    the Soviets would have collapsed in the late 1980s and the early 1990s as they
                    did or that they would lose their empire. Nor that this would happen so
                    peacefully. But then no one else foresaw this either.</p>
                <p>However, because of the Soviet nuclear capability and, to a certain extent, the
                    conventional threat which they posed, we had to practice a more nuanced
                    diplomacy than the all-out, confrontational type of pressure that some
                    right-wingers advocated. Nixon and Kissinger felt that a more nuanced approach
                    made more sense. Their approach to det�nte was no less hard-headed than the
                    approach of the right-wingers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave the Soviet Union, what about the status of
                        Berliduring the time that you were dealing with the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: In retrospect, we didn't have the crisis on Berlin that we had at the time
                    of the Berlin Airlift in 1948 or the Berlin Wall in 1961, when I was still in
                    the National Guard and before I entered the Foreign Service. At that time I was
                    almost called to active duty and might have been extended because of the crisis
                    over Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that well.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0339" n="Page0339"/>
                <p>LORD: However, there were some Berlin access pressures and problems. I don't
                    recall exactly when they came up in 1969 or 1970, but they led to negotiations
                    over the status of Berlin, which was a major achievement which Kissinger and
                    Ambassador Ken Rush, among others, pulled off. Rush was an effective Ambassador,
                    and one of the few that Kissinger worked closely with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He got Dean Rusk much involved in this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: And others, too. I don't recall much beyond that. I can't be much more
                    helpful on that. There were a couple of frustrating things with the Soviets
                    which happened during trips to the Soviet Union. At the end of the Moscow summit
                    meeting in 1972 we then were to go on to Iran and a couple of other places,
                    Austria before and Poland afterwards.</p>
                <p>We got stuck for several hours on the runway in Moscow and President Nixon
                    couldn't take off. Of course, that infuriated everybody. Talk about an
                    anti-climax! Another frustrating event happened, I believe, in the fall of 1973.
                    It was soon after Kissinger became Secretary of State, and I went back into the
                    State Department. The Middle East War broke out in September, 1973. Egypt
                    attacked Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the so-called Yom Kippur War of 1973.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's correct. I remember that we were at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New
                    York in the middle of drafting a major speech by Kissinger before the General
                    Assembly of the United Nations. To his credit, by the way, right in the middle
                    of this crisis, he continued to work on this speech. I couldn't believe that he
                    was still focusing on this speech, even as we were involved in this serious
                    crisis. Also, it was a very sad moment, because the wife of one of our top
                    people on the NSC staff who was working on the Middle East, Hal Saunders, had
                    just died. She died as a result of a fall in a bath tub. It was a very emotional
                    event.</p>
                <p>In any event, we went to Moscow shortly afterwards. We were trying to arrange a
                    cease-fire between the Egyptians and the Israelis. The Egyptians had attacked
                    the Israelis in the Yom Kippur War and successfully crossed the Suez Canal.
                    Ultimately, the Israelis counterattacked and surrounded the Egyptian Third Army
                    on the East side of the canal. They were about to wipe it out.</p>
                <pb facs="0340" n="Page0340"/>
                <p>Kissinger again showed his genius in negotiating the cease-fire between Egyptians
                    and Israelis. He was trying to get a cease-fire for the following reasons. For
                    the first time, after several wars, the Arabs had had some success in the
                    fighting against the Israelis. So their long-standing inferiority complex in
                    combat with the Israelis, particularly on the military front, was somewhat
                    relieved. The Egyptians were quite a threat to the Israelis for a while, before
                    the Israelis counterattacked. Not all of the Egyptian gains had been wiped out.
                    The Egyptian Army hadn't yet been wiped out. So, if the war stopped at that
                    point, Kissinger believed, the Arabs, feeling somewhat better psychologically,
                    might be more willing to negotiate than if they had been humiliated by the
                    Israelis once again.</p>
                <p>Similarly, the Israelis had been sobered up by the fact that for the first time
                    they had really been set back on their heels by the Egyptians, on the East side
                    of the Suez Canal. Of course, the Israelis counterattacked, but their losses had
                    been heavy, and it was a shock to them to find that they were still vulnerable,
                    after previous, easy victories. Letting the Israelis wipe out the Egyptian Army
                    would once again humiliate the Egyptians and the Arabs. This would probably give
                    the Israelis a new sense of hubris [pride] and self-confidence. Therefore
                    Kissinger saw that, at that moment, there would be a psychological point of
                    balance on both sides that would be suitable for negotiations. There would be an
                    opening for the U.S. to move the parties toward peace. The Arabs would have a
                    little dignity and self-confidence after at least a temporary victory, while the
                    Israelis would feel a certain sense of sobriety, having come close to suffering
                    a major defeat.</p>
                <p>In our negotiations with the Soviets in Moscow - at this important juncture - it
                    was important to agree with them on a cease-fire between Arabs and Israelis.
                    Time was of the essence. We had to get word to the Israelis to stop the fighting
                    within a day or two. Otherwise, they might go and wipe out the Egyptian Army,
                    further damaging Egyptian morale and contributing to Israeli hubris. So we were
                    sitting in the Kremlin, trying to get an urgent message out to our Embassy in
                    Tel Aviv to go to the Israelis on a ceasefire.</p>
                <p>We were appalled to find that we couldn't do it. The communications system
                    available to us just didn't work. We were going crazy. We didn't think that the
                    Soviets were screwing up our communications; it was in the Soviet interest to
                    have us communicate with the Israelis. We finally had to hand carry our messages
                    to Air Force Two [U.S. Air Force aircraft used by Secretary of State Kissinger]
                    and have the messages sent from the plane.</p>
                <p>I remember a specific incident where this problem first arose. Kissinger mentions
                    this in his book. After an exhausting day with the Soviets, he gave instructions
                    for a FLASH message [immediate precedence] to be sent to the Israelis. Kissinger
                    then went to bed to take a few hours' nap.</p>
                <pb facs="0341" n="Page0341"/>
                <p>We were all going crazy. Larry Eagleburger [Kissinger Special Assistant] was
                    there, as was I. I'm sure that Hal Saunders and Roy Atherton were there, and
                    maybe Joe Sisco as well. We couldn't get this damned message out to the American
                    Embassy in Tel Aviv. Of course, above all we were above all worried because
                    there was a very important question of timing and a need to get it to the
                    Israelis as quickly as possible. We also knew that Kissinger would not be a
                    happy camper if he woke up from his nap and found out that this message hadn't
                    been sent. We spent three or four hours trying to send it but weren't able to
                    transmit it.</p>
                <p>Then we heard Kissinger coming down the hall. He had taken his nap and he clearly
                    was going to say: “Well, have we heard back from the Israelis yet?” I swear that
                    I'll never forget this scene. There was about a dozen of us in this room, and
                    everybody knew that an explosion was coming. Everybody left the room except
                    Larry Eagleburger and me. Larry was chief of staff to Kissinger and was
                    responsible for operations at this point. I knew that Eagleburger was going to
                    catch unshirted hell. As I said, everybody else had left the room and the
                    advancing storm from Henry Kissinger.</p>
                <p>As Kissinger relates in his book, Larry Eagleburger has been eternally grateful
                    to me since then for staying with him, the only one brave enough to do so. Of
                    course, Kissinger exploded, as we thought he would. He's not an expert on
                    mechanical equipment, such as communications facilities. He couldn't understand
                    why the message couldn't be sent. In all fairness, he didn't beat up that much
                    on either Eagleburger or me. It was more a question of suspicion of the Soviets.
                    Kissinger just couldn't understand what was going on. These things were not of
                    cosmic importance, but believe me, at the time, they were scary. And it might
                    have had an impact on the timing of the ceasefire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This time it really was an important matter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Kissinger had a right to be flustered about it, and, to this day, we don't
                    know what happened. I don't believe the Soviets were responsible, although maybe
                    they just wanted to screw things up for us and be difficult. Maybe some Soviet
                    official didn't get the word that they ought to let this particular message get
                    out. So maybe it was Soviet interference, but they had no incentive to do
                    that.</p>
                <p>There was one other, rather amusing incident that wasn't even related to the
                    Soviet Union, but this happened in 1971 when I was working on the NSC staff. We
                    had a visit scheduled to the U.S. Sixth Fleet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Mediterranean.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0342" n="Page0342"/>
                <p>LORD: In the Mediterranean. President Nixon was also going to see the Pope in the
                    Vatican. Nobody quite realized that the symbolism of the President going in a
                    helicopter right from the Sixth Fleet to the Vatican wasn't the best idea. Nixon
                    was on the flagship and was looking forward to a major naval demonstration in
                    his honor, with ships proceeding past the ship he was on, with guns and missiles
                    being fired, and so on. I remember that shortly before this we attended a movie
                    on the ship. Someone came in and told us that President Nasser of Egypt had just
                    died. Nasser wasn't a particular friend of the U.S., but on the other hand this
                    was a major event.On his own, Kissinger ordered the cancellation of this firing
                    demonstration, which had been set up for President Nixon to observe. When Nixon
                    found out that the demonstration had been canceled, he went absolutely ballistic
                    because he wanted to see it anyway. However, Kissinger felt that this would not
                    be taken well in the Arab world when they learned that Nixon was attending a
                    live fire demonstration just after Nasser had died.</p>
                <p>On that same trip, but shortly afterwards, President Nixon went to see the Pope,
                    traveling by helicopter from the ship he had been on to the Vatican. The Vatican
                    was concerned about Secretary of Defense Mel Laird being present at the meeting
                    with the Pope. So they asked that Laird not attend. Laird, of course, wasn't
                    going to take “No” for an answer. He wanted to meet the Pope. So he showed up,
                    uninvited, at the Vatican, smoking a cigar. Of course, as the Nixon party went
                    in to see the Pope, Laird was crowding in to see the Pope as well. Laird put his
                    cigar in his pocket, and a little fire began in his pocket, which he tried to
                    put out by slapping his coat. The Vatican people thought that Laird was clapping
                    at something the Pope had said, so they all started clapping, too. This was one
                    of those weird events that happen.</p>
                <p>One other thing, as I just skip around here, I can't recall whether I mentioned
                    the Brian McDonell relationship. Brian McDonell was the young man who was
                    opposed to the Vietnam War. He fasted outside the White House. It was a real,
                    serious fast which went on for days. He looked as if he was risking his life.
                    Here was another side of Kissinger that people don't realize. He was genuinely
                    concerned about this person's well-being. He was furious, particularly at the
                    establishment and at the Johnson and Kennedy administration people like the
                    Bundy brothers [McGeorge Bundy and William P. Bundy] who turned on Kissinger and
                    Nixon for not ending the war, when they had a lot to do with getting us into
                    this mess in the first place. But Kissinger genuinely respected religious people
                    or genuine pacifists who disagreed or turned against our policies in Vietnam.
                    Kissinger also had considerable respect for people who avoided extremist
                    positions but just generally felt that the Vietnam War should end and that our
                    entry into the war had been a geopolitical mistake, but didn't consider us moral
                    vultures for continuing the war. Kissinger had no respect for people like Jane
                    Fonda [actress daughter of Henry Fonda, the actor], who treated Hanoi as the
                    good guys and us as the bad guys. So Kissinger had respect for some of these
                    people and had compassion for Brian McDonell. Kissinger sent me out to speak to
                    Brian and try to persuade him to break his fast. Then Kissinger invited the
                    young man into the White House without any publicity. He didn't leak this story
                    to the “Washington Post” to show that he was a good guy. I don't think that he
                    ever got any publicity for this event that I am aware of.</p>
                <pb facs="0343" n="Page0343"/>
                <p>McDonell came into the White House and had a long talk with Kissinger. As a
                    result, he called off his fast. I don't know whether he would have died or not,
                    but he might have. Subsequently, we kept in touch with Brian. He had an
                    African-American wife, which was unusual back in 1970, 1971, or 1972, whenever
                    it was. I remember that we (including Bette) had dinner with him and his wife.
                    So that was just a small episode, but it's another aspect of Kissinger that
                    people don't always know about.XIII. NSC/STATE DEPARTMENT - WATERGATE
                    (1973-1974),WIRETAPPING (1973)</p>
                <p>Q: You noted that the Watergate Affair sort of cut off our ability really to deal
                    with Hanoi from a position of strength. How did you people regard this situation
                    as it developed? This really intrudes into the work of the NSC and policy
                    planning, but how did you see this?</p>
                <p>LORD: First, it was a process of incremental awareness, just as it was for more
                    or less every American. That was true for Kissinger as well as for myself. He
                    didn't know anything about the Watergate Affair. He really didn't know. For all
                    of us it was a process of becoming incrementally aware of what had happened and
                    of the seriousness of it.</p>
                <p>It wasn't even a blip on my radar screen while I was at the NSC. I don't believe
                    that Kissinger was aware of its significance before 1973. Of course, this all
                    began during the 1972 Presidential elections campaign. The stupidity of it is
                    well known, not to mention the fact that by the time the burglary of the office
                    of the National Democratic Committee occurred, it was clear that President Nixon
                    was going to win reelection by a landslide in any case. So it wasn't necessary.
                    Then, of course, there was the stupidity of the coverup. However, none of us
                    knew anything about all of this up to and through the elections of 1972. I think
                    that there was a minor newspaper article in the “Washington Post” about a
                    burglary in the office of the National Democratic Committee on the day following
                    the break in. However, nobody that I knew drew any conclusions from that. So
                    this was not anything that one even considered at the time.</p>
                <p>I left the NSC staff in May, 1973. I certainly didn't leave because of the
                    burglary at Watergate. I wasn't aware that that was going to be a serious
                    problem, even then. I left the NSC staff because I was exhausted. Four years of
                    dealing with Henry Kissinger were exhilarating and terrific, but they were also
                    exhausting, because of the long hours, the pressures, his style of work, and so
                    on. I wanted to see more of my children, who were then quite young. I wanted to
                    see them before they grew up. I wanted to get out and re-charge my intellectual
                    batteries.</p>
                <p>So I was getting out of the NSC staff for a variety of reasons. Plus, I felt that
                    we had opened up to China, we had ended the Vietnam War, and we had moved ahead
                    on relations with the Soviets. All of the positive elements were in place, and I
                    thought that it was a very good time for me to leave. In particular, the
                    relations with China were on track, the Vietnam War and negotiations had been
                    concluded. So my two major responsibilities were looking good, as well as our
                    general foreign policy stance.</p>
                <pb facs="0344" n="Page0344"/>
                <p>I always thought that I would be coming back into government service and I also
                    suspected that I would be coming back with Kissinger a few months later.
                    However, as I left government service in May 1973, I was not really aware of the
                    Watergate Affair. I came back to government service in September 1973. I can't
                    vouch for Kissinger's views. I suppose by then that he was beginning to see that
                    this incident and its fallout were beginning to become a problem. However, I
                    only became aware of this gradually. As of the fall of 1973 we didn't think that
                    it was going to become all that serious, as Kissinger was appointed Secretary of
                    State.</p>
                <p>Shortly afterwards, and certainly in the course of 1974, it began to become
                    obvious that the situation involved in the Watergate Affair was serious,
                    although I don't have the exact time-line here. The point I'm making is that
                    there was no one day when we realized that we were facing a crisis, as events
                    happened, and some of them were more dramatic than others. There was Butterfield
                    revealing the taping system in President Nixon's office. There were revelations
                    about John Dean [then White House chief of staff], and then the episodes when
                    Haldeman and Ehrlichman of the White House staff were fired. The Congressional
                    hearings progressed. The potential seriousness of the matter became increasingly
                    clear. We began to get the feeling that we were inexorably headed for a terrible
                    ending. I can't place this feeling in terms of any one day. It was just a series
                    of events which made the situation more and more serious.</p>
                <p>Similarly, the impact on foreign policy did not take place overnight. There was a
                    gradual draining away of momentum. For example, each trip to China after 1973
                    became less productive, until there was a very chilly summit meeting with
                    President Ford in 1975, as I mentioned. Relations with the Soviet Union were
                    slowing down. There was more restraint on what we were trying to do with the
                    Soviets, both 'sticks' and 'carrots'. Congress was counter-attacking with
                    legislation, restrictions, and hearings. The North Vietnamese were unraveling
                    the Paris Agreement of 1973, in part seeing the weakness of the President and
                    the mood of Congress. Not all of this was a result of the Watergate Affair but
                    was a combination of the weakness of the Presidency or the fact that President
                    Nixon might actually be leaving office. Then the entry into office of Ford as an
                    interim President meant that things were increasingly slowing down and
                    unraveling.</p>
                <p>So Kissinger emerged as the one person sort of holding things together. He was
                    controversial even then, of course. The issue of wiretapping came up, as well as
                    other things which people didn't like about him. However, some people forget
                    that he was generally considered the most admired man in America. He appeared on
                    magazine covers as 'Superman'. He was the one person that people thought that
                    they could trust or who had stature, in addition to the fact that he was
                    untainted by the Watergate Affair itself, except for the peripheral dimension of
                    wiretapping. Kissinger was also the one American official respected abroad. So I
                    think that was one of his more heroic accomplishments, holding our foreign
                    policy together despite the weakness of the executive branch.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0345" n="Page0345"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you like to talk about the wiretapping?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. Of course, I was unaware that wiretapping was going on. Q: Can you
                    explain the background of this practice?</p>
                <p>LORD: Basically, what happened was the following. There was a series of leaks on
                    sensitive matters, early in the Nixon administration, in 1969 and then in 1970.
                    One particular leak which triggered a strong reaction from President Nixon and
                    his colleagues, including Kissinger, was the revelation in the “New York Times,”
                    by a journalist called Bill Beecher of the secret bombing in Cambodia of
                    Vietnamese communist enclaves. These Vietnamese communist troops were coming
                    across the border into South Vietnam, attacking our troops, and then going back
                    to sanctuaries in Cambodia. I didn't know about the bombing until I became
                    Kissinger's special assistant in February 1970.</p>
                <p>I felt that the bombing was legitimate, in the sense that these Vietnamese
                    communist troops were violating Cambodian soil and penetrating into South
                    Vietnam. Our bombing was confined to Vietnamese concentrations near the border.
                    They were designed to lessen our casualties. We talked about this and the effect
                    it might have on the level of American casualties. However, the issue was that
                    it was secret from the American people and almost all of Congress, and that we
                    were bombing targets in another country, even if it was justified.</p>
                <p>Prince Sihanouk acquiesced in this practice, as long as it was secret. The
                    argument for keeping it secret was that Sihanouk would never agree to it if it
                    was made public. He could not say: “Yes, go ahead and bomb my country”. But he
                    didn't want the North Vietnamese threatening his control of Cambodia. He
                    recognized that the Vietnamese communists had invaded his country, that he
                    couldn't do anything about this, and therefore he had no problem with our
                    beating the hell out of the Vietnamese communists along the border, as long as
                    it was secret. So that's why it was secret. It wasn't frivolous to keep it
                    secret.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, Congress, the American people, and the press were very upset when
                    they learned that we had been bombing targets in another country, whether or not
                    it was justified, and without the American people knowing about it. Anyway, that
                    particular leak drew the attention of President Nixon and his associates. Later
                    on, the Pentagon Papers were leaked by Daniel Ellsberg, and that also fed this
                    paranoia. This contributed to the atmosphere in which the Watergate Affair
                    developed, in addition to the wiretapping.</p>
                <pb facs="0346" n="Page0346"/>
                <p>A key point about the Nixon/Kissinger strong reaction to the leak of the Pentagon
                    Papers. I fully shared their view that this was unpardonable. Whatever one's
                    views, you don't leak a huge amount of classified material. Moreover, all the
                    study and embarrassing revelations were about the Kennedy and Johnson
                    Administrations. So Nixon and Kissinger were defending not against personal
                    embarrassments for their Administration but the general principle of conducting
                    government for future presidents. In addition, this was in June 1971, a few
                    weeks after we had made our major, secret proposal to North Vietnam to try and
                    end the war, and a few weeks before Kissinger's secret trip to China. Obviously
                    the domestic uproar over the Pentagon Papers did not give Hanoi an incentive to
                    respond positively, through this was not the decisive factor. Moreover, we were
                    secretly trying to open up with China. The Chinese - and other governments -
                    would have little confidence that the U.S. government could keep secrets.</p>
                <p>I believe that some time in the spring of 1970 wiretaps were put on the phones of
                    about a dozen people, including several of us on the NSC staff and a couple of
                    journalists. I don't have a complete list of the people whose phones were being
                    wiretapped. There were about a dozen. Now, why were we picked? Because these
                    were national security leaks, involving Vietnam and Cambodia, and there may have
                    been other aspects. Nixon and Kissinger felt that these leaks could really
                    undermine our foreign policy. We had secret negotiations under way with North
                    Vietnam, we had secret negotiations on the opening to China, and secret dealings
                    to a certain extent with the Soviets. If all of these matters were leaked to the
                    public, it would inhibit our efforts to conduct relations with those countries.
                    It would also tell the Chinese and the others that we couldn't be trusted to
                    keep secrets, and this would complicate everything.</p>
                <p>There was also the general principle that if you work for the government, you
                    don't leak secret, sensitive information. If you disagree with a given policy,
                    you can either stay in office and work to try to change the policy from the
                    inside, keep debating, but loyally carry out the policy while you continue to
                    serve. You don't leak information to destroy that policy. Or you can resign as a
                    matter of principle and then try to protest and change the policy from the
                    outside. What you should not do, and I feel strongly about this myself, is to
                    try to undermine a policy with which you disagree by leaking sensitive
                    information, for example, to the press or to Congress. I never leaked sensitive
                    information in my life. I had plenty of criticism of policy and wrote and spoke
                    to Kissinger and others about them. But I believed that if you lost the
                    argument, you either carry out the policy or quit. You don't sabotage it by
                    leaking.</p>
                <p>Of course, we all give background press briefings and say things authorized
                    around the edges, but in terms of actually leaking classified material to
                    unauthorized persons, I've never done that.</p>
                <pb facs="0347" n="Page0347"/>
                <p>So there was general concern, some of which I understood, by the way, about what
                    these leaks were doing to our foreign policy as well as to the basic principles
                    under which it operates. As a result, President Nixon ordered the wiretaps, and
                    Kissinger did not resist. The President and Kissinger were also told by Attorney
                    General John Mitchell that these wiretaps were legal, which they were. So
                    Kissinger went along with them.</p>
                <p>The reason that some other members of the NSC staff and I were chosen to have
                    their phones tapped was that some of the information which had leaked had been
                    so tightly held that only a few people knew about it. Therefore, the phones of
                    those who might be suspected of having the ability to learn about the
                    information which leaked were tapped. In my case I had access to just about
                    every conceivable secret in the field of foreign policy that we had. I was
                    Kissinger's right hand man and was in the middle of many secret negotiations on
                    various fronts. I was one of the few people who could have been suspected of
                    leaking this material. In addition, Secretary Kissinger's staff was suspected by
                    Nixon and his people of being liberal Democrats from, God forbid, the State
                    Department and academia, and were considered to be rather suspicious. In fact,
                    we were quite moderate and liberal, compared to the people on the domestic side
                    of the Nixon White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that you are talking about Ehrlichman, Haldeman,
                        anpeople like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's right. So there was that general suspicion of us as well. Of course,
                    Kissinger justified the wire taps on the ground that he was truly concerned
                    about leaks. He thought that leaks were outrageous in principle, were also
                    hurting our foreign policy, and were jeopardizing ongoing negotiations with the
                    Chinese, the Vietnamese, and others. Secondly, Kissinger couldn't say to Nixon:
                    “How dare you suspect my staff. Just wiretap other people. Don't tap my people.”
                    In fairness, we were the ones who had the information, and he couldn't be
                    selective about the persons whose phones should be tapped. He already felt
                    sensitive because President Nixon felt that Kissinger's staff was overly liberal
                    anyway.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, Kissinger would argue that he had been assured that it was legal to
                    engage in wiretapping, which it was, however uncomfortable one might feel about
                    tapping someone with whom you were working every day. So that was his
                    defense.</p>
                <p>I didn't know anything about the wiretapping, but I will say this. Even though I
                    didn't know anything about it, I had suspicions, which I didn't really believe,
                    that might be going on. I had a couple of reasons for this. My phone had some
                    funny clicks on it at times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this involve your phone at home?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0348" n="Page0348"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes. Then I distinctly remember one incident that really left me puzzled.
                    To make a long story short, I received a phone call from the White House about
                    one issue or another, when I was at Les Gelb's house on a Sunday. Les was a
                    critic of the Administration. At the time, I didn't know how the hell they knew
                    I was there. On the other hand, perhaps I had left his number since I was always
                    supposed to be reachable.</p>
                <p>Kissinger and Haig were the only ones on the NSC staff who knew about the
                    wiretapping. I guess that Kissinger felt sufficiently uncomfortable about the
                    whole issue that he had Al Haig deal with the FBI, informing them which people
                    should be wiretapped, or something like that, and checking transcripts at
                    times.</p>
                <p>Leaving aside ethics, this wiretapping was such a dumb thing to do. You're not
                    going to find out about leaking by tapping someone's phone. If I were going to
                    leak something, I wouldn't do it over the phone. I would go to some restaurant,
                    sit in a corner, and whisper in some journalist's ear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or garage.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Or garage. It seemed to me to be a dumb thing to do. That wapart of my
                    reaction.</p>
                <p>I didn't know anything about the tap on my phone until May 1973. I was just about
                    to leave government service for the reasons that I've just mentioned. I was
                    exhausted, and things looked good in the foreign policy field, and particularly
                    in my areas of specialization.</p>
                <p>One day in May 1973, Kissinger called me up to his office. This was unrelated to
                    my departure, since Kissinger knew that I was leaving government service anyway.
                    He said: “I want to let you know something. There's going to be an article in
                    the 'New York Times' which reveals the fact that several members of the NSC
                    staff, including yourself, have had their phones tapped.” I would like to think
                    that I gave the right response, though I think that it was probably a little bit
                    on the soft side. We had been through an awful lot together. I knew the entire
                    context and was outraged myself at the leaks. I felt that wiretapping was
                    terrible in principle, but the leaks could hurt our foreign policy. I also knew
                    that Kissinger had a staff that was considered liberal and that it was under
                    suspicion from the White House.</p>
                <pb facs="0349" n="Page0349"/>
                <p>With all of his stature, there were still people who didn't like Kissinger, and
                    he was somewhat vulnerable in the White House. I also knew that I was one of the
                    few who knew all of the secrets which had been leaked. So for all of these
                    reasons, I'm sure my response was restrained, to be sure. I didn't embrace Henry
                    Kissinger, as it were, and say: “Thank you very much for having my phone
                    tapped.” I certainly didn't. I didn't suggest that I approved of what had been
                    done. However, I have to be honest. I was not outraged and didn't express
                    outrage. I don't remember exactly what I said but I didn't make this meeting
                    difficult for Kissinger. I said something to the effect that this didn't seem to
                    be a very effective way of stopping leaks, as a practical matter. I said that I
                    wasn't going to hold this against him, or something like that. It certainly
                    wasn't overly unfriendly, and I wasn't tough with him, for all of the reasons
                    that I've mentioned.</p>
                <p>One thing that I did which I'm really ashamed of took place because I was loyal
                    to Kissinger and I had a degree of understanding. I was actually interviewed
                    once on TV. I never had appeared previously on TV. The TV people wanted to
                    interview people whose phones had been wiretapped and get their reactions. My
                    comments were roughly as follows, I said that of course I wasn't happy that this
                    had happened. I did say something to the effect that, given the fact that
                    terrible leaks had taken place and given the national security implications of
                    my access to secrets, I said that I didn't agree with this practice, but I
                    understood why it had been done.</p>
                <p>As I look back on this, I realize that I should just have stayed off television.
                    I didn't have to get up there and protest, because I had a more nuanced view of
                    this whole matter. I now see that I went too far in the other direction out of
                    loyalty. It was a fleeting episode, and I wasn't embracing or defending
                    wiretapping. But I later realized that if I wasn't going to show outrage, I
                    shouldn't have appeared on TV at all. I should just have kept quiet, rather than
                    looking overly complacent about wiretapping.</p>
                <p>I've already basically expressed my views. No matter how you rationalize it,
                    there's something wrong with working day by day with someone, even as their
                    phone is being tapped, and your deputy [in this case, Al Haig] is reading the
                    transcripts of what you said. You can't excuse this practice, and I think that
                    Kissinger has admitted that awkwardness, even with the mitigating factors that
                    I've mentioned. I've never held the wiretapping against Kissinger, unlike
                    someone like Mort Halperin who left Kissinger's staff (for other reasons before
                    he knew about the wiretapping) and went on to sue him. I respect those who have
                    that feeling of outrage. However, I had this nuanced reaction to this process,
                    and I continue to have it. I don't approve of it. I think that this is a darker
                    side of Henry Kissinger. However, I shared his view that these leaks were
                    serious business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did any of your colleagues quit because of
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0350" n="Page0350"/>
                <p>LORD: I don't believe that anybody quit because of wiretapping. Several people,
                    including Tony Lake, Mort Halperin, Roger Morris, and Bill Watts had already
                    left Kissinger's staff long before this story broke. A couple of other people
                    like Joe Kraft, a journalist, were wiretapped. God knows why they wiretapped a
                    journalist. So I don't believe that anyone quit because of the wiretapping.
                    Either they had already left or, like Helmut Sonnenfeldt, who was also
                    wiretapped, they had the same kind of reaction that I did. That is, the practice
                    was stupid and basically wrong. But it was not something to resign over for the
                    reasons I mentioned.</p>
                <p>I can see why people would say that this is a ridiculously soft position. They
                    might say that I should have been so outraged that I should have resigned. I was
                    leaving government service anyway, so I didn't face that choice. To be honest
                    with you, I don't think that I would have left my job because of the
                    wiretapping. However, I was leaving government service anyway, so this issue
                    didn't arise. Of course, I went back to work for Kissinger a few months later,
                    so I obviously wasn't outraged.</p>
                <p>One amusing thing that I will say is that there were times when the FBI was
                    listening in on my phone, and my wife was talking. She would often talk to her
                    mother in New Jersey. They would go on at great length in Chinese, which used to
                    drive the wiretappers listening in on this crazy. My wife is not a great one to
                    talk about recipes, but there were times when they were literally talking about
                    Chinese recipes. Here was the U.S. Government, in this case, the FBI, learning
                    about Chinese recipes in Chinese!</p>
                <p>Q: It reminds me of an incident when we were in Yugoslavia. My wife was very busy
                    on the telephone, organizing an international Girl Scout troop. I'm sure that
                    the UDBA, the Yugoslav secret police under Tito, learned more about how to
                    organize a Girl Scout troop than they wanted to know.</p>

                    Vietnam. I can try to give some sense of how I organized the staff in Policy
                    Planning, the assets that I had, what I think that the role of Policy Planning
                    should be, and so on. I can discuss some of the issues that I was involved in

                    from when to when?</p>
                <p>LORD: I was there from September 1973, until January 1977.</p>
                <p>Q: We can get to it, but could you give us the background to how the role of
                    Policy Planning was conceived of when you entered this office, and how it
                    changed?</p>
                <p>LORD: Let me cover quickly how I got from the NSC [National SecuritCouncil] staff
                    to the Policy Planning Staff.</p>
                <p>Early in 1973 I decided that I wanted to take a break from government service. I
                    had worked hard for many years, and specifically as Kissinger's Special
                    Assistant in the NSC. This involved a lot of traveling and very long hours. I
                    wanted to see more of my children, as they grew up. I wanted to take a break and
                    recharge my batteries, as it were, both intellectually and physically. So early
                    in 1973 I indicated to Kissinger that I would be leaving the NSC staff. However,
                    I also felt that this was a good time in terms of where we stood on the issues I
                    had been working on. As of the beginning of the second Nixon administration, and
                    remember that this was before the Watergate scandal really broke upon us, we had
                    ended the Vietnam War and we'd gone to Hanoi in February of 1973, to try to
                    further the normalization of relations with North Vietnam. We'd opened up
                    relations with China, including arranging for the trip by President Nixon, his
                    trip, and later ones. We were on a path in terms of relations with China that
                    was brand new. We were making significant progress with the Soviets. I had also
                    gone to Moscow for that summit meeting. That situation seemed to be going well.
                    Therefore, on the issues on which I had been working most fully, I felt that we
                    had made important breakthroughs. In the case of Vietnam the future seemed to be
                    uncertain, but I felt that we had done all that we could do for the time being.
                    So this was a logical time to leave government service, both in terms of
                    substance, as well as for personal reasons.</p>
                <p>In May 1973, just as I was about to leave government service, I learned for the
                    first time that my phone had been wiretapped. We've covered that. Let us go over
                    it again, knowing there will be repetition.</p>
                <p>One day in early May, 1973, shortly before I was to leave, Kissinger called me
                    into his office and told me that on the next day it would be revealed in the
                    “New York Times” that there had been a wiretapping operation under way,
                    involving the home phones of about a dozen members of the NSC staff, the Defense
                    Department, and a couple of journalists. I was one of those whose phone had been
                    tapped.</p>
                <pb facs="0352" n="Page0352"/>
                <p>Kissinger gave the following explanation of this matter on this and other
                    occasions. First, he assured me that it was entirely legal and that the
                    administration had carefully gone over this process with the Attorney General
                    and others. Secondly, there had been very damaging leaks to the press, for
                    example concerning the secret bombing of Cambodia, as well as other, national
                    security issues. These leaks had been very damaging to our foreign policy and
                    jeopardized our opening to China and other initiatives, in the view of Kissinger
                    and of President Nixon. Thirdly, a lot of these leaks could only have come from
                    people who had access to sensitive information, including members of the NSC
                    staff. Fourthly, Kissinger said that he was absolutely confident in my own
                    loyalty and that I hadn't been involved in the leaking of information. He made
                    it clear that the wiretapping was no reflection on me. Fifthly, he said that, as
                    National Security Adviser, he could not tell the President, the FBI [Federal
                    Bureau of Investigation], and others that his staff should be exempt from
                    wiretapping. If they were going to pursue the wiretapping, since some of the
                    people around Kissinger had access to this sensitive information and were fairly
                    liberal in political outlook, anyway, it would have to include some of the
                    members of the NSC staff, who had access to the kind of information that was
                    leaked. He said that, therefore, this was a form of protection to some of the
                    members of the NSC staff to show that we were innocent of leaking
                    information.</p>
                <p>To be honest about it, my own reaction to this information was not one of total
                    outrage and was quite moderate. However, I can understand why others might feel
                    that I should have been more outraged. My view was the following. First of all,
                    this was a very stupid thing to do. If the President and Kissinger were worried
                    about leaks, they were not going to find out about this over wiretapped phones
                    because people who were going to leak sensitive information to journalists would
                    probably go into some quiet restaurant, sit in a corner, and whisper in their
                    ear. They were not going to leak information over the telephone. So I thought
                    that this was a clumsy, as well as obviously somewhat unattractive way of
                    proceeding. I recognized and felt strongly myself that the ongoing leaks were
                    damaging to national security. One can certainly make the case that the Nixon
                    and Kissinger apparatus was much too secretive. We saw the excesses during the
                    Watergate Affair and elsewhere. However, if you're trying to conduct secret
                    openings to China and secret negotiations with Vietnam and other things, one
                    could argue that security was clearly jeopardized by leaks and by giving people
                    in other countries a sense that we can't maintain discipline and security.</p>
                <p>So I understood the problem and the rationale. Also, if you were going to
                    wiretap, you had to include the NSC staff, including me, because I was one of
                    the few people who had access to all of this information. The Russians, the
                    Chinese, and the Vietnamese experts, for example, would know everything going on
                    in their area. But I, along with Kissinger and Haig, was one of the few people
                    who had access to all of the areas. I understood the rationale. I still thought
                    that it was stupid, but I did not feel outraged, either in terms of my personal
                    conduct toward Kissinger or my public comments. As I say, I could understand
                    that people would have different views on such matters. To this day, I think
                    that it was not the way to go about trying to find out about leaks.</p>
                <pb facs="0353" n="Page0353"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were several resignations, more or less over this
                        matter,including Bill Watts, whom I have interviewed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No, his resignation was not really over the wiretapping issue. Most of the
                    people who were wiretapped had already left government service or were
                    journalists. For example, there was Tony Lake. I believe that Watts was among
                    those who were wiretapped, although I can't remember now. Mort Halperin was
                    another one. These people had left government service over Cambodian policy or
                    for other reasons. We've discussed that in these interviews. They might well
                    have left government service if they had learned that they had been wiretapped,
                    if they were still in the service. However, the fact is that the point was moot.
                    They had already left for other reasons.</p>
                <p>Q: Just a further detail, from an historical point of view. Has it come out, or
                    is the suspicion well founded, involving some person or persons over the
                    years?</p>
                <p>LORD: Over the leaks?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No. It has never been determined, any more than we know who was Deep Throat
                    in connection with the Watergate Affair. No, the answer is that this operation,
                    which proved to be very damaging to Kissinger politically and personally, as
                    well as embarrassing to the Nixon administration generally, also didn't turn up
                    anything. Indeed, there were even some absurd and amusing overtones. For
                    example, when they tapped my phone, I don't really know, but I assume that the
                    FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] people who listened in must have gotten
                    excited when my wife was talking in Chinese to her mother. However, this turned
                    out to be a conversation about Chinese recipes. Their telephone conversations
                    were not of a sensitive nature.</p>
                <p>I had some suspicions, even before I knew I had been wiretapped. I remember
                    occasionally hearing funny sounds on my phone. Obviously, I knew that there had
                    been damaging leaks, and I knew that they involved some issues that very few
                    people knew about. And I was among those who knew about them. So we even used to
                    joke about this, at times, wondering about who was listening in on our
                    conversations, never really thinking that it was really happening.</p>
                <pb facs="0354" n="Page0354"/>
                <p>My strong belief is that if you're working for the government and have a problem
                    with the established policy, you debate it internally within the government. If
                    you lose the debate, you carry the policy out faithfully, and you don't leak the
                    issue in an effort to try to damage the policy. If the policy is of such
                    overwhelming moral and political importance that you think it's of fundamental
                    significance, you resign. We discussed this in the context of the Cambodian
                    incursion of 1970. I don't believe in leaks. Now, there's a thin line between
                    leaking and backgrounding. Backgrounding is at least authorized by higher
                    authority in an effort to build support for a policy or try to explain it in a
                    deniable fashion to influence the national debate. That's different from what a
                    more junior person does when he goes out on his or her own responsibility,
                    leaking information in an effort to damage the established or proposed
                    policy.</p>
                <p>So, I want to make clear that I was leaving government service shortly after that
                    anyway, after a couple of months of consideration. I didn't leave because of the
                    wiretapping. In retrospect, I should have stayed absolutely mum publicly, in
                    terms of media inquiries. I remember that I appeared on TV once or twice under
                    great pressure from the media to say something. I made a nuanced response to the
                    questions. Nevertheless, I expressed more tolerance for what had happened than I
                    should have. In retrospect, I wish I had said nothing. It would be hypocritical
                    to criticize the tapping for the reasons which I have just mentioned. However, I
                    should not have expressed myself publicly in any way, although it was only one
                    or two interviews indicating that I wasn't really upset. I should have been
                    absolutely silent in public, rather than expressing partial understanding of
                    what had been done. So I'm not particularly proud of what I did.</p>
                <p>I've explained why I was leaving government service. Kissinger was obviously very
                    sorry to see me leave, in view of our personal relationship and our having
                    worked closely together on so many of these issues. He had great respect for my
                    work. However, he understood why I was leaving. The President also greatly
                    valued my work, especially on China and Vietnam. He wrote several nice letters
                    to this effect.</p>
                <p>Around June 1973, my wife and I took a trip to Portugal. I took things easy at
                    home and spent time with my wife and children. I began thinking about what I had
                    been through. I didn't have any master plan as to what I would do next. I went
                    out to the Aspen Institute [in Colorado], where I gave a couple of talks on
                    China. It was August, I believe. I was about to have a week's vacation and also
                    engage in an intellectual seminar on great books, when I got a phone call from
                    Kissinger. He asked me to come to California to talk to him because he was about
                    to become Secretary of State and, in fact, wanted me back on his team. I had my
                    usual, ambivalent reaction because I was looking forward to a little bit longer
                    break from government service. On the other hand, I had been out of government
                    for three months. I was excited about returning to the State Department but also
                    sort of wished that this invitation to return to work hadn't been extended so
                    relatively quickly.</p>
                <pb facs="0355" n="Page0355"/>
                <p>So I went out to California. I remember that Brent Scowcroft was there, as well
                    as Larry Eagleburger. I believe that I met Kissinger at San Clemente, where
                    President Nixon went when he went to California. Kissinger told me that he
                    wanted me to become the Director of the Policy Planning Staff in the State
                    Department. I accepted. We all began talking about the coming challenges.</p>
                <p>During this period I was out of the service, I hadn't missed too much in the
                    field of foreign policy. There were no China trips, so I didn't miss any of
                    them. Kissinger had planned to go to China during the summer of 1973, but that
                    trip had been postponed. At the time I returned to working for the government,
                    Kissinger was trying to work out a settlement in Cambodia, with the help of the
                    Chinese. Previous work on a settlement had started to fall apart. In any event I
                    didn't miss a trip to China or Russia with Kissinger. The Year of Europe
                    Initiative was launched by the Nixon administration with a speech by Kissinger.
                    He said that it was high time to pay attention to our European allies, given the
                    changing outline of the world and the challenges facing all of us. We had dealt
                    so much with Russia, China, and Vietnam during the first Nixon term. That
                    European initiative didn't get off to a very good start, but the launching of
                    this program took place while I was out of government.</p>
                <p>The Vietnam Peace Agreement was beginning to unravel, as Hanoi began to probe and
                    violate the cease-fire. Kissinger had an unsatisfactory meeting with the North
                    Vietnamese negotiator Le Duc Tho in Paris to try and tighten up the
                    implementation of the agreement. Meanwhile, the Watergate issue was picking up
                    steam, though its full dimensions were certainly not yet clear.</p>
                <p>It was in September, 1973, when Kissinger went through his confirmation hearings
                    before the Senate. We helped him get ready for those hearings. He was closely
                    questioned on the wiretapping and other controversial issues. He got through
                    that, and then there was a very emotional swearing in of Kissinger as Secretary
                    of State, at the White House. His parents, quite elderly already, were present.
                    His mother held the Bible when he took the oath of office. It was quite a moving
                    experience to have an immigrant become Secretary of State for the first time. A
                    lot of people attending the ceremony were moved to tears. You might think that
                    the person first moved to tears would be Kissinger's mother. She had escaped
                    from the Nazi tyranny in Germany, and her son was becoming Secretary of State.
                    We asked her afterwards: “Everyone else was crying. Why weren't you?” She said:
                    “Well, my son absolutely forbade me to cry. He told me that it was not allowed
                    in any way.”XIV. STATE DEPARTMENT POLICY PLANNING STAFF - GENERAL(1973-1977)</p>
                <pb facs="0356" n="Page0356"/>
                <p>LORD: So I entered on my duties as Director of the Policy Planning Staff in
                    September, 1973. Kissinger made it very clear to me that he saw this position as
                    an important post. He wanted someone as Director of Policy Planning who knew his
                    way of thinking and that of President Nixon and who had a conceptual approach to
                    foreign policy. Of course, we had worked very closely together for years, and he
                    thought that I fit the bill in that respect. The job of Director of the Policy
                    Planning Staff is an Assistant Secretary position, but it doesn't require Senate
                    approval, so I didn't have confirmation hearings for this job. Kissinger made it
                    clear that this position was not window-dressing but that he saw the Policy
                    Planning function as an important operation. That was consistent with his
                    approach to foreign policy, the strategic, conceptual, and long term approach,
                    as opposed to some others. We have had many lawyers as Secretary who deal with
                    issues on a short term, day to day basis but don't try to develop a strategic,
                    conceptual approach.</p>
                <p>Let me be a little immodest at the beginning with regard to my staff. Others can
                    judge the work we did over the following three and one-half years. When I left
                    Policy Planning in January, 1977, we received a collective Distinguished Honor
                    Award, which is the highest award you can get in the State Department. Frankly,
                    that award could have been given to me, personally, but I told Kissinger that I
                    would prefer that it be awarded to the entire Policy Planning Staff. So the
                    whole staff received it, because this was a collective effort.</p>
                <p>I would like to start right off by quickly listing some of the people that I had
                    on that staff. Those who follow the Foreign Service will recognize that this was
                    a very distinguished group. At the time they were quite young and unknown, in
                    many cases. Others were at the mid-career level, while still others were more
                    senior. Almost all of them went on to very elevated careers, and many of them
                    became Ambassadors or Under Secretaries. I won't list every name, but I do want
                    to get this down, because I am very proud of the group we assembled. I purposely
                    looked for a spectrum of views, both liberal and conservative, to the extent
                    that you can determine that in the Foreign Service and other US Government
                    agencies. I tried to recruit younger personnel. I lowered the required age level
                    greatly from what it had previously been; the average age went down many, many
                    years. What I inherited is no reflection on my predecessor. My predecessor
                    didn't have the kind of Secretarial interest in policy planning that the change
                    from Secretary Rogers to Secretary Kissinger was going to bring. He also didn't
                    have a particularly strong staff, because it wasn't that important an office.
                    Again, I'm not criticizing my predecessor. He just had a less bountiful hand to
                    play with than I was given, when I worked for Kissinger.</p>
                <pb facs="0357" n="Page0357"/>
                <p>I also looked for a mix of backgrounds. I wanted the majority of the people
                    assigned to the office to be Foreign Service officers, for a variety of reasons,
                    including morale. I also felt that it was important to bring in some academics
                    from outside the government, as well as some people from the Department of
                    Defense, the CIA, the economic agencies, to a certain extent, and USIA [United
                    States Information Agency]. I wanted to have people who, above all, could think
                    and fit into a policy planning mode and not just be operational in outlook, and
                    could write well. I thought that personnel should be the first thing to move on,
                    because it is the most important. If you want to do a good job, you get good
                    people, and you delegate authority to them. In every job, the first two things I
                    do are to design goals and recruit the best people.</p>
                <p>So that's what I gave my greatest early attention to, lining up the best people.
                    I was also humane to those people I inherited and whom I wanted to see assigned
                    elsewhere. I talked to a lot of people around the building and elsewhere and
                    found out who was strong on the staff. I began thinking of people to bring in. I
                    thought moving quickly on changes was more humane, rather than letting people
                    wonder what their future was going to be. I made up my mind to let those know
                    early on that they would be leaving the office. I explained that this was no
                    reflection on them. I was bringing in a new team. I helped them get other jobs.
                    So within about a week of my taking the job, I alerted about ten people that
                    they would be leaving the office. This was not a lot of fun, but I thought that
                    this was a better way to go about the process. It didn't involve a loss of face.
                    It just involved a new person coming in and making changes. I wanted to get the
                    best possible people, and, indeed, I had a mandate from Kissinger, which was one
                    of my assets, that I could line up the best people. He said that he would back
                    me in competition for the assignment of personnel with the regional and
                    functional bureaus. If I was trying to get a good person assigned, I could use
                    my clout with Henry Kissinger to get that person for the Policy Planning
                    Staff.</p>
                <p>Just to tick off some of the names involved. I won't elaborate, as it would take
                    a lot of time. My Deputies over the years included Sam Lewis, Reg Bartholomew,
                    and Nick Veliotes. Although not officially my Deputies, I used Mike Armacost and
                    Tom Thornton de facto in this capacity. Going by region, for Europe and Russia,
                    among the people that I had working with me were Tom Simons, Jennone Walker,
                    John Kornblum, and, of course, Reg Bartholomew. All of these people have since
                    become Ambassadors. In Asia I had Mike Armacost, as well as myself, Tom Thornton
                    for South Asia, and Douglas Pike for Indochina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Douglas Pike was quite well known for his studies on the
                        Viet Cong.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0358" n="Page0358"/>
                <p>LORD: Absolutely, yes. He represented the more conservative part of my staff,
                    compared to some of the others. For the Western Hemisphere, in addition to Sam
                    Lewis himself, I had Luigi Einaudi. For the Middle East I had Bob Oakley, as
                    well as Sam Lewis and Nick Veliotes, all of whom later became Ambassadors. For
                    Africa I had a man named William DuPree, who also helped me on resources for the
                    State Department. For political-military, arms control, and non-proliferation
                    issues I had Jan Kalicki and Jerry Kahan in addition to Bartholomew. On economic
                    issues I had Jeff Garten, Chuck Frank, Paul Boeker, as well as Sam Lewis. On
                    human rights matters, as well as Europe, I had Sandy Vogelgesang. On speech
                    writing, I had Charlie Hill and Mark Palmer. I won't elaborate, but I think that
                    people will see that in each case they went on to serve as Ambassadors,
                    Undersecretaries, Assistant Secretaries, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A significant number of them have also been interviewed by
                        us.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, that's right. So I'm pretty proud of having selected them. I keep
                    debating with others as to whether this was the greatest staff ever assembled. I
                    think that the Kissinger staff on the NSC [National Security Council] staff
                    probably was the best group I ever served with. However, I have never heard of a
                    staff in the State Department that matched this one.</p>
                <p>Now for an effective program; this gets more philosophical about the role of S/P
                    [Policy Planning Staff], and I think that's of interest here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: S/P being the Policy Planning Staff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. First of all, I changed the name. When I inherited the Policy Planning
                    Staff, it was called S/PC, for Policy and Coordination Staff. I just didn't like
                    the word “Coordination,” which looked a little mechanical to me. Frankly, it was
                    also a little misleading because we didn't really coordinate policy among all
                    the agencies involved as much as we might have liked to do, because we were
                    looking ahead. So I simplified the name of the office and changed it back to
                    what it was under George Kennan, who was the first Director of Policy Planning
                    and a man I greatly respected. So I called the office “S/P” for Policy
                    Planning.</p>
                <p>I also made sure that I talked individually to all of the former Directors of
                    S/P, including George Kennan, Paul Nitze, George McGhee, and many other
                    distinguished people. I read up about the Policy Planning function. Of course, I
                    also talked to Kissinger and current and past staff members about how we would
                    go about performing our functions. I studied various documents, and so on.</p>
                <pb facs="0359" n="Page0359"/>
                <p>Now, the assets that you need to be effective as a policy planner are the
                    following. Sometimes the policy planning staff has been important, with George
                    Kennan's time being a very good example. At other times it has been essentially
                    window dressing and was there so that a Secretary of State could say: “I've got
                    someone looking ahead,” but he or she hasn't always paid attention to it. At
                    other times the Director of S/P has been personally close to the Secretary of
                    State, but has been primarily operational and has focused on one or two issues,
                    spending a lot of time on them, as opposed to employing the staff fully. At
                    times they have even had clout with the Secretary of State across the board, but
                    did not really engage the staff of S/P. They have written papers that people
                    have not read. They were not really engaged, as a staff, in supporting the
                    Secretary. So there have been different ways of doing this job.</p>
                <p>I had a lot of advantages, leaving aside how well we did, which others can judge.
                    I certainly had the assets needed in this job, which included the following.
                    First, the Secretary of State under whom I served had a conceptual outlook and
                    thought in a strategic, global, and long term sense, as opposed to someone who
                    is more legal and tactical. Certainly, Kissinger filled the bill in this sense.
                    I'll elaborate further on that. Related to that, you need a Secretary of State
                    who keeps looking ahead and who wants to know the long term implications of
                    nearer term issues. He also should look to S/P to play a devil's advocate role
                    in challenging what is being done, to see whether it is a mistake or could be
                    done better, and to do contingency planning.</p>
                <p>Next, you need close, personal ties between the Director of Policy Planning and
                    the Secretary of State. The Director of S/P should have the confidence of the
                    Secretary and should be someone who understands his or her thinking and has a
                    sense of how to deal with that person. Of course, Kissinger and I had become
                    very close personally, as well as professionally.</p>
                <p>Next, related somewhat to the foregoing, is access to the Secretary. The Director
                    of S/P generally has to have access to the Secretary of State. It helps if there
                    are one or two issues that the Director is almost operational on, as I continued
                    to be on China. This gave me a natural, regular access on that issue. However,
                    beyond that, you need to have general access, whether this involves sitting in
                    on important staff meetings, traveling with the Secretary or more generally
                    knowing what is going on, in global terms. I had much more regular access on all
                    these fronts. This is important to demonstrate to other people in the
                    Department, including Assistant Secretaries, that the Director of S/P is a
                    player in the game, so that they will cooperate and pay attention to him or her.
                    It also keeps the the Director in tune with the Secretary's thinking and gives
                    him regular opportunities to weigh in on various topics.</p>
                <p>The next consideration is that the Director of S/P needs to have access to all
                    classified information, including very sensitive information. We all have access
                    to classified information, but the question is whether the Director of S/P is
                    seeing the Eyes Only traffic and other, very sensitive information. Is he seeing
                    the code word material and highly restricted telegrams, and so on? I had that
                    access as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0360" n="Page0360"/>
                <p>Finally, the Director of S/P needs a mandate from the Secretary to recruit the
                    best possible staff, because you often have to compete with others, including
                    Assistant Secretaries of regional or functional bureaus, to get those people.
                    Again, I had that mandate. Kissinger, in appointing me, stated that I would have
                    “top priority on the ablest young people in the Foreign Service.”</p>
                <p>In short, in all of these areas needed, to do an effective job in the policy
                    planning field, I had those advantages, from the very beginning.Then you have to
                    decide how to approach the job, obviously in consultation with the Secretary of
                    State himself. Here was my approach. First, I saw my staff as, above all,
                    shaping and supporting the policies of the Secretary of State and, through him,
                    of the President. Also I saw my role as supporting the various senior officials
                    on the Seventh Floor generally, where the Undersecretaries have their offices.
                    That is where the Undersecretaries for Political, Economic, and Security Affairs
                    are located. It was important for them to feel that they had access to a staff
                    in S/P to which they could turn for a different point of view or to question
                    something which they are getting from the Sixth and Fifth Floors [where the
                    geographic and functional bureaus have their offices].</p>
                <p>It seemed to me that the role of S/P was to be global in scope and to have a
                    Presidential, Secretarial, and Seventh Floor perspective, as opposed to the
                    specific regional or functional approaches of the Sixth Floor and the various
                    Assistant Secretaries. (This was not unlike my personal global role for
                    Kissinger on the NSC staff.) This is not a value judgment, but S/P should be
                    able to look at an issue when, for example, the European Bureau pushes one point
                    of view, and the African or Economic Bureau pushes another one. What they
                    recommend may be good for their region but how do their recommendations fit into
                    the overall priorities of the Department and White House? This is not so much
                    for the domestic, political implications which are up to the political level
                    people to decide, but rather for S/P to say that if you do this or that, it
                    might have an impact over there. This is the kind of perspective that the
                    President or the Secretary of State has to have, as opposed to an Assistant
                    Secretary on the Sixth Floor. So I also kept that in mind.</p>
                <p>Now the key issue always faced in policy planning, and I faced it as Director of
                    Policy Planning, is how to steer between the two extremes that you want to
                    avoid? One extreme might be called an Ivory Tower academic approach, where you
                    write papers saying what the world's going to look like in 10 years and what we
                    ought to do in preparation for that. A busy Secretary of State, no matter how
                    conceptual his or her approach, either doesn't have the time or the interest, or
                    he or she doesn't quite know what to do with this approach when they have it.
                    It's apt to sit in his in-box.</p>
                <pb facs="0361" n="Page0361"/>
                <p>The other extreme is to become overly operational and duplicate what the typical
                    regional or functional bureau is doing. This might involve drafting cables and
                    seeing foreign Ambassadors. You don't want to do that. However, you want to have
                    an impact on policy. You don't want to be Ivory Tower academic, but you
                    shouldn't be doing what the regional and functional bureaus should be doing. You
                    have to find a way to steer between those extremes and be relevant to policy,
                    but free of operational details.</p>
                <p>One decision which I made, and I believe that it paid off, was to be cooperative
                    with the regional and functional bureaus and to work with them. In fact, to be
                    an asset for them. That was the carrot. I had the carrot because I had all of
                    the advantages I mentioned, in terms of access to the Secretary of State and to
                    information. The regional and functional bureaus knew that I was obviously
                    plugged in to the Secretary, personally and professionally, and in terms of
                    information. This could be an asset to them. Knowing his thinking, I could help
                    them persuade the Secretary of State, where I agreed with the bureau concerned,
                    on what should be done. However, of course, I had a hidden stick. If a given
                    bureau tried to cut me out of what I thought I deserved to have access to, and
                    if they weren't cooperative with me, they knew that I could go to the Secretary
                    with my own memorandum or through my own, verbal approach to Secretary
                    Kissinger. So I had that hidden stick.</p>
                <p>I was very conscious of the need to project a very cooperative, positive approach
                    to the regional and functional bureaus. I did this partly because I thought that
                    I could be more effective that way, and partly because I thought that this was
                    the right thing to do. I thought that it was good for the Secretary not to have
                    to fight a lot of bureaucratic battles. Partly also, I was sensitive to the fact
                    that I was in my early 30s and was dealing with senior people whom I respected,
                    who were 10, 20, or 25 years older than I and with greater experience than I
                    had. I knew that I was seen as close to Kissinger. In terms of my personal style
                    I just didn't want to be seen as some young, arrogant punk using his access to
                    Secretary Kissinger at their expense. In most cases I had genuine respect for
                    the regional and functional bureaus and the people in them in the Foreign
                    Service. I had been a Foreign Service officer. So I thought that it was
                    important to draw on their expertise and perspectives.</p>
                <p>My whole approach therefore was based on seeking cooperation with others in the
                    Department of State. This attitude worked better with some bureaus than others.
                    I usually didn't have to play hard ball. On the whole, I felt that we in S/P
                    were allies of the bureaus and not adversaries.</p>
                <pb facs="0362" n="Page0362"/>
                <p>I'll give just one, specific example of where I was able to be helpful. The
                    Bureau of African Affairs was trying to get a change in American policy toward
                    southern Africa and to be somewhat more sensitive to racial questions and
                    minority rights in South Africa, Rhodesia, and so on. Their memoranda to
                    Secretary Kissinger emphasized the utility of being on the side of justice, the
                    aspirations of the people of Africa, and so on. They also even mentioned some
                    domestic payoff in the United States. These were legitimate concerns. However,
                    knowing Kissinger as well as I did, I knew that approach, by itself, was not
                    going to persuade him. He is a balance of power, realpolitical type, and isn't
                    overly preoccupied with human rights and so on. By itself, this approach was not
                    going to be particularly persuasive.</p>
                <p>I also believed that we should change our policy toward southern Africa and take
                    some initiatives in this direction. However, I urged the African Bureau to
                    stress in their memoranda to Secretary Kissinger or our joint memoranda the
                    geopolitical advantages of changing our African policy. Namely, in competing for
                    influence in Africa with the Russians and, to a certain extent, with the Cubans,
                    who had troops in Angola and so on. I said that if the Black African nations
                    could see that we were trying to be helpful on some of these issues, like
                    Rhodesia and South Africa, we would have greater geopolitical influence in
                    Africa, as well as meeting local aspirations. That's an example of how I was
                    able to help the African Bureau with their argumentation, since I knew
                    Kissinger's thinking. I don't want to be patronizing or condescending. A lot of
                    the officers in the African Bureau were perfectly able to come to these same
                    conclusions on their own. In any event, our joint-efforts paid off — in the
                    famous Lusaka speech coming out more firmly for justice in Africa; intensive
                    travel by Kissinger to the continent; a Rhodesian settlement, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You advised them to use the right slang or use the
                        righpushbutton words. That is, words that would appeal to Kissinger.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Exactly. To place the emphasis on building up our influence in the
                    continent, versus the Soviets and Cubans. So, on the whole, I had a very
                    cooperative relationship with the Bureau of African Affairs. I would have my
                    people sit in on the staff meetings of the Bureau of African Affairs. This was
                    true generally. For example, when there were staff meetings in a regional or
                    functional bureau, one of my people would normally be there. The idea was to get
                    a sense of what was going on and to report back to me. But my purpose also was
                    to try to be helpful to the people in the Bureaus and to relay Seventh Floor
                    moods and feelings, not to mention maintaining the influence of S/P..</p>
                <pb facs="0363" n="Page0363"/>
                <p>Q: I was wondering, as you mentioned this, whether you felt a certain sense of
                    exhilaration within the geographic bureaus that you had someone who was paying
                    more attention to their concerns? Quite frankly, former Secretary of State
                    William Rogers, as I've mentioned before, was a very nice man and a very capable
                    lawyer. However, foreign affairs are just not his strong point. There was a
                    feeling, particularly with Henry Kissinger in the NSC, that the State Department
                    had been superseded. Did you sense this when you returned to the State
                    Department?</p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, together with some apprehension as to how to deal with this
                    juggernaut, as some people thought of Kissinger. That's a good point about the
                    attitude in the Department of State toward Kissinger. There were mixed feelings
                    about him. There was a feeling that now the Department of State was going to be
                    the center of the action. There was a feeling that it had been cut out when
                    Kissinger was in the White House. Remember that Kissinger was still wearing two
                    hats at this point. He was Secretary of State and also National Security Adviser
                    for another year, which was a somewhat absurd arrangement, in many ways. He
                    wound up often sending a memorandum to himself. The feeling in the Department of
                    State was that Secretary Kissinger had the ear of President Nixon. Kissinger was
                    a giant figure already, in terms of what he had done in the first few years in
                    the Nixon administration. He was acknowledged as being smart as hell and
                    conceptual in his approach. It was believed that he would drive the Department
                    of State toward excellence. Many people in the Department felt that they would
                    be at the center of the action and that what they did would count. They knew
                    that they would be dealing with an interesting, major figure. Those were all of
                    the pluses.</p>
                <p>The minuses, of course, related to Kissinger's secretive nature. There was a
                    fear, which was borne out to a certain extent, and which I will get to, that a
                    lot of people in the Department would be cut out of access to sensitive
                    information. Ambassadors would get by-passed. As a result, there was concern
                    that they wouldn't know what was going on. The fear was there would only be a
                    small number of people in the Department who would be dealing with Henry
                    Kissinger. As I've already indicated, he could be very rough with people in
                    intellectual debate and cut them down if he thought that they didn't handle
                    themselves well. He would make some people nervous. I'm sure that there was some
                    sense that the whole wiretapping episode and other aspects of his personality
                    were less than ideal. So I think that there was some ambivalence about the
                    arrival of Henry Kissinger.</p>
                <p>However, I think that, basically, morale in the Department of State and among
                    FSOs [Foreign Service officers] is never perfect. I think that most people in
                    the Department of State were excited by the basic point that the Department was
                    going to be the center of the action, even though they might be somewhat
                    uncomfortable about some of Kissinger's stylistic dimensions.</p>
                <pb facs="0364" n="Page0364"/>
                <p>Relevant to that, and I want to make this point very clearly, is the fact that
                    Kissinger had respect for the Foreign Service before he came to the Department
                    of State. I think that he had more respect for the Foreign Service than, say,
                    President Nixon. Most of his NSC staff was FSOs. Kissinger made clear from the
                    very beginning that he was going to use the Foreign Service, because he knew,
                    based on his operations in the White House in which he had tended to cut out the
                    State Department, that much of the Foreign Service was going to be suspicious of
                    him. Even though they were happy about being the center of power now, they
                    resented what had happened before. So he went out of his way in his rhetoric to
                    say that he wanted to use the Foreign Service. However, beyond that, and much
                    more important than that, which you would expect from a PR [Public Relations]
                    standpoint, he understood that a Secretary of State, with a global mandate now,
                    just couldn't handle his job by himself and a few of his key advisers, many of
                    whom he just brought over from the NSC [National Security Council], like myself.
                    He knew that he had to depend on a much larger team. It was in his self-interest
                    and that of President Nixon to take advantage of the professionalism,
                    experience, and the reach, as well as the numbers of people in the Foreign
                    Service. Therefore, he had no choice but to make greater use of the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>Kissinger developed great respect for the Foreign Service in many ways, although
                    he still felt that many members of the Foreign Service were too cautious or
                    tactical in their outlook. He never lost that view. He obviously had high
                    opinions of some and low opinions of others, as we all do, depending on whom he
                    worked with. From the beginning he understood that he had to find a mix between
                    continuing to work closely with his colleagues from the NSC and he also wanted
                    to involve the Foreign Service in what he was doing. The conventional wisdom in
                    some quarters is that Kissinger came into the department and brought with him
                    Larry Eagleburger, Winston Lord, Helmut Sonnenfeldt, Bill Hyland, and Hal
                    Saunders and that they were going to run the State Department. That just isn't
                    true. He did bring all of us into the State Department, and he used all of us
                    very much. However, he did this in conjunction with the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>First, keep in mind that most of the names I've mentioned had either been in the
                    Foreign Service already or in other parts of the bureaucracy anyway. It's not as
                    if these were political appointees who didn't know anything about foreign
                    policy. Many of us had our own ties to the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>What Kissinger did, as Secretary of State, was to continue to work closely with
                    us, but also with Foreign Service officers. He promoted and used as Assistant
                    Secretaries and Undersecretaries the very best people in the Foreign Service.
                    I'm afraid that as I discuss this matter, I'm leaving some names out and I'm
                    embarrassed about that. I should include Phil Habib, both as Assistant Secretary
                    for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and later Under Secretary for Political
                    Affairs. I guess that Joe Sisco, who became Undersecretary, was not an FSO
                    [Foreign Service officer] but was a semi-FSO.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0365" n="Page0365"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Sisco had been an FSO, but he never served
                        abroad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's right. Many people thought of him as an FSO. Roy Atherton worked on
                    Middle Eastern affairs. Tom Enders specialized in economic and Latin American
                    affairs and tragically died a few years ago. There was also Arthur Hartman for
                    Europe. These are some of the best Foreign Service officers. I realize that I'm
                    leaving a lot of very capable people out. I believe that in almost every case,
                    at least as far as I can remember, the Assistant Secretaries were FSOs. Some of
                    the Undersecretaries were also FSOs. As I said, Larry Eagleburger and I had also
                    been FSOs.</p>
                <p>So Kissinger would have people on the Seventh Floor who were close to him, but
                    they worked very closely with the FSOs. For example, in my case with regard to
                    China, specifically, I worked very closely with Phil Habib, and then Art Hummel,
                    Habib's successor as Assistant Secretary for East Asian Affairs. Regarding
                    Middle Eastern affairs, Hal Saunders worked very closely with Roy Atherton, as
                    well as Joe Sisco. On European and Russian affairs, Sonnenfeldt and Bill Hyland
                    worked very closely with Arthur Hartman. The Assistant Secretaries and the FSOs
                    had very broad access to information and were as much involved as any of us who
                    sat on the Seventh Floor. So there was a very nice mix of FSOs and other people
                    that Kissinger had brought over from the NSC. For these FSOs, of course, this
                    was very exhilarating and exciting.</p>
                <p>Probably, when you got to the level of Deputy Assistant Secretary, the morale
                    situation was the same, most of them being closely involved in policies/all of
                    them FSOs. I think that there was still some resentment, say, at the Country
                    Director level and below that they were not so directly involved. Kissinger
                    believed in not having very large meetings. If he was discussing particularly
                    sensitive issues, he often would have only the relevant Assistant Secretary
                    there. So the regional bureaus were clearly involved; it was not just
                    Kissinger's insiders that attended these meetings. But he would also notice if a
                    Country Director or below were sitting in on these meetings. He was always
                    worried about leaks and sensitivities. I remember arguing with him about this to
                    no avail. Others also talked to him about this issue, saying that this was not
                    the way to do business. The Assistant Secretary would have to rely on his or her
                    Country Director who would have more detailed knowledge of a particular nation
                    or issue. The Kissinger arrangement was bad for morale to a certain extent. And
                    it was not particularly efficient. Just to take a specific example. If you're
                    meeting with the Foreign Minister of a given country, and the Assistant
                    Secretary is the only person from the regional bureau attending it, the
                    Assistant Secretary has to take the notes and prepare the memorandum of
                    conversation. So it's a waste of senior people's time. It's good for the Country
                    Director or below to take that burden away and also to be kept fully informed
                    and have 'face' with his foreign counterparts. Attendance at some of these
                    meetings would be on an individual, need to know basis, if there was a
                    particular need.</p>
                <pb facs="0366" n="Page0366"/>
                <p>At my regular staff meetings with about 25 officers assigned to S/P, which I
                    thought were important as a management tool and were good for morale purposes, I
                    would review what happened at the meetings with Secretary Kissinger and what was
                    happening in the Department more generally. I felt that individuals should know
                    more about what was going on with our foreign policy and on the Seventh Floor,
                    and not just in his or her area of responsibility. On sensitive matters I would
                    brief those officers on my staff most directly involved. However, I never let
                    Kissinger know how much I was telling all of my people. I needed their help, I
                    needed their thinking. This, in turn, helped Kissinger and the national
                    interest. I wanted to promote good morale. I also told them that, because of the
                    sensitivity of some of the subjects, I counted on their discretion.</p>
                <p>Q: The Foreign Service is a little like the United States Marine Corps. That is,
                    once you're a Marine Corps officer, you're always a Marine Corps officer. In
                    other words, once a Foreign Service officer, you're always a Foreign Service
                    officer. I would have thought, particularly during the early period of your
                    service back in the Department of State, you would have been buttonholed by a
                    lot of relatively senior people who would ask you: “Tell me, how do I deal with
                    this guy?” That is, they were referring to Kissinger. I would have thought that
                    you would have found yourself in the position of being an interpreter, a fixer,
                    or conciliator.</p>
                <p>LORD: That's absolutely right. This happened, particularly during the first few
                    months, but really throughout my time in the Department after my service as a
                    Special Assistant to Kissinger on the NSC staff. I had, after all, been
                    Kissinger's closest associate in the White House.</p>
                <p>I think that it's fair to say that in the State Department, on a day to day
                    basis, Larry Eagleburger dealt much more with Kissinger than I did. I was in
                    Policy Planning, not operations, but I had regular access to Kissinger, saw him
                    almost every day, sat in on various meetings, and went with him on about half of
                    his trips. He said I could go with him on any one of them, but I had other
                    things to do, and chose trips selectively. Whereas Larry Eagleburger was
                    Kissinger's operational guy. He was Kissinger's Executive Assistant and also
                    became Undersecretary of State for Management. Eagleburger was the man who would
                    deal with other U.S. Government agencies at a high level. He was the man who had
                    to deliver the bad news and was the hatchet man on tough issues within the
                    Department itself. He was the political antenna for Kissinger and saw him
                    continually.</p>
                <p>So, although I remained extremely close to Kissinger and was one of his closest
                    associates, on a day to day basis Eagleburger was to be found more closely by
                    Kissinger's side. In terms of hours spent with him, sensitivities, and politics,
                    Eagleburger was closer to Kissinger. Nevertheless, people would come to talk to
                    me and, I am sure, went to see Larry Eagleburger as well. Larry was a Foreign
                    Service officer and was popular in the Foreign Service. He knew the Foreign
                    Service and always defended it with Kissinger, as did I. Actually, the Foreign
                    Service didn't need that much defending. As I said, Henry Kissinger knew that he
                    had to use the Foreign Service, and he respected it.</p>

                <p>So people would come to me and ask me what kind of arguments would appeal to
                    Kissinger and the best way to go about approaching him. I always tried to be
                    helpful, in the national interest and in the interests of Kissinger and the
                    various bureaus in the State Department that were asking my views. Also, I like
                    to get along with people. I thought that made me more popular but also probably
                    more effective, if they figured that I was cooperative, as opposed to
                    outmaneuvering them and using my insider status to unfair advantage.</p>
                <p>Q: There was one thing which was so picky about the Baker organization in the
                    State Department and maybe, to some extent, the present situation under
                    Secretary Madeline Albright. There was a coterie which formed around the
                    Secretary of State which almost had, as its main goal, to promote the Secretary
                    of State. They get a little bit protective, like a mother, or a wife, around the
                    Secretary. This happens all the time.</p>
                <p>LORD: Sure. Let the record show that those are your words, not mine! I think that
                    there have been different examples, as you say, and I didn't work with all of
                    these administrations, so I can't pretend to be an expert. However, I agree. I
                    think that with Secretary Baker there were a few, selected people, very able, by
                    the way, on the whole, whether it was Zoellick, Tutweiler, or Dennis Ross. These
                    three come to mind. That's also true with Madeline Albright, whether it's Rubin,
                    Shokas, or Sherman, to give some examples.</p>
                <p>As far as I could tell the other extreme was the George Shultz operation. As far
                    as I could determine, and I was sitting in China at the time as Ambassador,
                    Shultz relied on the Foreign Service almost completely, with very little inside
                    team coterie. I think that Shultz was a very good Secretary of State, although
                    that's not the only reason.</p>
                <p>Kissinger was somewhere in between, as I think I've already indicated. Namely, he
                    did have some insiders, like Larry Eagleburger, myself, Sonnenfeldt, Hyland, and
                    so on. However, he also worked with the geographic and functional bureaus. The
                    bureaus ran policy, in conjunction with Kissinger. On a day to day basis, we
                    relied, for example, on Arthur Hartman, Tom Enders, and Phil Habib to formulate
                    policy, with help from the Seventh Floor. I think that Kissinger was sort of in
                    between. He had enough people that he felt that he trusted and had worked with
                    over the years. These would give him solid advice. He counted on their loyalty.
                    They helped to implement his thinking. He also knew that he had to rely on the
                    Foreign Service and drew on the best Foreign Service officers and worked with
                    them. So I don't think that he suffered from reliance on the inside club
                    mentality. On the other hand, he didn't fully rely on the Foreign Service
                    without some help from his own people, as Shultz did.</p>
                <p>Q: I had something in mind a little beyond that. That is, it turns on something
                    that is very important in the United States, the public relations side. In other
                    words, trying to put the best spin on what the Secretary of State is doing.
                    Secretaries of State often bring bad news, because good news doesn't mean much
                    to them. The world, after all, is a messy place.</p>
                <pb facs="0368" n="Page0368"/>
                <p>I'm referring to these others, and particularly the group around Secretary Baker,
                    but people around other Secretaries of State as well. I had the feeling that
                    they wanted to keep their man from being tainted with any bad news. So I was
                    talking about a public relations spin. What was the thrust of the group around
                    Secretary Kissinger?</p>
                <p>LORD: Those are your words, not mine, but I think that there is no question about
                    it. It is human nature and also important to try to ensure that the Secretary of
                    State is popular. You don't have an important constituency to rely on, as the
                    Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of Labor has, for example. To be
                    effective in Washington, you have to have a good press. This also helps a
                    Secretary abroad. So these are not illegitimate goals. Of course, if you get to
                    the point where you are preoccupied with PR [Public Relations] considerations,
                    you're short changing American interests, undercutting the President, or being
                    unfair. That would be a mistake, and I won't make those judgments.</p>
                <p>There's no question that Secretaries Baker and Albright are two examples of
                    people who are very conscious of their image and can get quite nervous if they
                    think that someone else is upstaging them. Good examples of this are Secretary
                    Albright and Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, Ambassador Tom Pickering and
                    Secretary Baker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was Secretary Baker, who got him out of his post at the
                        UN.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: The Baker-Pickering relationship is a good example. Of course,the UN seems
                    to be a particular place where this issue comes up.</p>
                <p>I understand the thrust of what you're saying. I think that in Secretary
                    Kissinger's case, he was clearly worried about PR. However, I would say that the
                    difference here, although obviously Secretaries Baker and Albright spent a lot
                    of time on PR, personally, is that Kissinger was basically his own PR guy. Of
                    course, people like Larry Eagleburger would get on the phone and his press
                    people would try to spin things, as any Secretary of State would have them
                    do.</p>
                <pb facs="0369" n="Page0369"/>
                <p>However, Kissinger spent a lot of time, both at the NSC and, of course, at the
                    State Department, working with the press and working on the public dimensions of
                    foreign policy. He did this for obvious reasons, the ones I've mentioned, and
                    some reasons which were self-serving in some cases. Also, he did it conceptually
                    to try to explain, to our domestic audience and also abroad, what we were trying
                    to do in the field of foreign policy. He spent a lot of time figuring how to get
                    across these themes. At the NSC he did mostly backgrounders. He didn't have a
                    formal press conference until the Peace is at Hand conference on Vietnam in the
                    fall of 1972, because he was the National Security Adviser. As Secretary of
                    State, of course, he held press conferences and gave testimony before
                    Congressional committees, which he didn't do, when he was in the White House. He
                    gave a lot of speeches, interviews and backgrounders in the US, abroad, on
                    planes. He worked on several levels. He didn't really rely too much on
                    spin-masters, though Eaglebruger and his press people worked at this.</p>
                <p>He also thought that this was important because the kind of foreign policies
                    which he and President Nixon were trying to conduct were complex, and Americans
                    were not so comfortable with them. This meant especially policies based on the
                    maintenance of a balance of power, which he thought was more of a European
                    approach to foreign policy. He was always concerned about the Wilsonian tendency
                    to advocate missionary type policies. He also felt that during this period, and
                    I'll get back to this, in the wake of the Vietnam War and the Watergate Affair,
                    the United States was facing a very difficult domestic situation. On the one
                    hand, one reaction to the Vietnam War and the Watergate Affair was that America
                    was sufficiently flawed itself that we ought to pay attention to our own
                    problems and not get that much involved in the world. This was the line that
                    Senator McGovern [Democratic Party candidate for President in 1972] emphasized,
                    suggesting that we were somewhat evil ourselves, as witnessed by the Vietnam War
                    and the Watergate Affair and therefore that we weren't good enough for the
                    world.</p>
                <pb facs="0370" n="Page0370"/>
                <p>There was a contrary tendency, among neo-conservatives and others, that Kissinger
                    had been snookered [i.e., deceived] by the Russians. They were a little bit more
                    nervous about the opening to China and felt that we should be more robust in
                    many ways. So it was a complicated domestic scene to deal with. Against the
                    backdrop of American idealism and not paying attention to the balance of power,
                    because we didn't have to worry about it, thanks to friendly neighbors,
                    continental resources, and two oceans, Kissinger thought that it was necessary
                    to work hard introducing realism. This was in addition to the PR and popularity
                    reasons which I have described. It was Kissinger's view that, by virtue of
                    geography, America was blessed in many ways. We were separated by the Pacific
                    and Atlantic Oceans from other powers. We had unthreatening neighbors, on the
                    whole, Canada and Mexico. Therefore, America had the luxury of not having to
                    worry about the balance of power throughout most of its history, unlike Europe.
                    For geographic and other reasons the European countries had to worry about which
                    country was dominating the scene. Kissinger felt that it was necessary to
                    introduce America, including the Congress and the people, to these themes of
                    American national interest and the balance of power. He wished to counter the
                    trends of dictating to the world what should be done and withdrawing from the
                    world, out of a sense of guilt. We should lead but our allies and friends should
                    bear more responsibilities in an increasingly multipolar world.</p>
                <p>For all of these reasons Kissinger paid a lot of attention to the domestic side.
                    As it turned out, I would say that our biggest problem, and I think that
                    Kissinger would admit this himself, was that he didn't pay enough attention and
                    certainly did not express himself enough on the continuing need for idealism and
                    some promotion of values, in addition to the balance of power. He would state
                    the need to have both and, in fact, gave a major speech on morality and
                    pragmatism in Minneapolis. I remember helping him to draft this speech on this
                    very subject, emphasizing that you have to have both ideals and pragmatism, the
                    national interest and a well developed sense of values. It was a very thoughtful
                    speech, and, as always, was pure agony to produce.</p>
                <p>Clearly, Kissinger came under attack from both the Left and the Right, as did
                    Presidents Nixon and Ford, for not paying enough attention to human rights or at
                    least values. He seemed too pragmatic. Anyway, for all of these reasons he
                    worked on the domestic scene.</p>
                <p>To get back to your original question, I think that no one spent more time than
                    Secretary Baker in worrying about these issues. It wasn't just that his troops
                    were going out there; Baker was working on these issues himself.</p>
                <p>Q: He was a real figure. The other Secretaries we mentioned frankly were not
                    really much fun to associate with. I don't mean that they were objects of fun,
                    but rather they were not particularly interesting people.</p>
                <pb facs="0371" n="Page0371"/>
                <p>LORD: That's true. Kissinger was a huge and colorful figure, one the media loved
                    to cover. That's a very good point, though Kissinger's reputation was somewhat
                    distorted. For example, Kissinger's contacts with women were totally
                    exaggerated. Kissinger was not a ladies man, although before he was married, he
                    had dates with various actresses. More importantly, he was brilliant,
                    controversial, and tough. Therefore, there were great emotions expressed about
                    him. He was, however, attractive to journalists traveling with him and covering
                    him because he was so conceptual in his approach. He spent much time with
                    journalists, trying to explain our policies. He had a sense of humor, which is
                    very important. He could engage people and was really quite extraordinary. So,
                    for all of these reasons, he had a well-defined, public persona. I'll come back
                    a little bit later to Kissinger's role as Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>I've already talked about the assets I had and my basic approach to the various
                    bureaus in the Department of State. The next issue to address is the role which
                    I saw for policy planning. I thought about this a lot. I saw a distinction
                    between these extremes of Ivory Tower academia, and long term papers irrelevant
                    to policymaking and operational activities which may be relevant to policy but
                    which really don't serve the Secretary or the President and just duplicate the
                    other bureaus.</p>
                <p>Among the roles I saw, and some of these overlapped, was the need constantly to
                    look ahead and to consider problems over the horizon. Ideally, the bureaus
                    should be doing this as well, but they are so consumed with day to day problems
                    and operations that it is very difficult for them to look one, two, or three
                    years in the future, ask themselves what's coming at us, and how we go about
                    dealing with it.</p>
                <p>This could involve a specific event coming up, such as looking ahead and saying
                    that a world conference will be held on a given issue a year from now. We could
                    consider how to begin to get ready for that. All of this would be done in
                    conjunction with the bureaus, but my staff and I had the time to worry about
                    these matters. By contrast, the bureaus were heavily focused on drafting cables
                    and seeing Ambassadors on a short term basis. Or the next NATO [North Atlantic
                    Treaty Organization] foreign ministers or summit meeting will come up in a few
                    months. How would we get ready for that? Either that or the next UN General
                    Assembly meeting. The bureaus have to worry about these matters as well, but
                    Policy Planning could make sure that either the bureaus were thinking about this
                    systematically, or we could help them think about it in an organized way.A few
                    times we actually went through the process of preparing alert lists, always in
                    coordination with the bureaus. I always wanted to cooperate with them. I would
                    write: “These events are coming up, Mr. Secretary, over the next year,” or the
                    next two years and send him a list. We would indicate some of the key issues
                    likely to come up - a conference, election, or anniversary, for example - and
                    how we were getting ready to deal with them. We could say that we were working
                    with such and such a bureau on this subject, or another bureau might be doing
                    this work. Or we could say that nothing is being done yet and we could suggest
                    that the Secretary ask a bureau to do this or that. The idea was to try to stay
                    ahead of events.</p>
                <pb facs="0372" n="Page0372"/>
                <p>Q: What was the role of INR [Bureau of Intelligence Research]? I would have
                    thought that it would have been a good backstop for you in preparing in depth
                    analyses of an area.</p>
                <p>LORD: That's a very good point. Of course, in the case of INR, we had Bill Hyland
                    as Director. He was a very good INR Director. We would often prepare joint
                    memoranda on a given subject. It wasn't just a matter left to the regional or
                    functional bureaus to give their judgments, not only on what was coming up but
                    what was apt to happen. INR was not supposed to be recommending policy. They
                    were supposed to be sort of like the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] in that
                    respect, describing and analyzing situations. Of course, Hyland could take off
                    his INR hat and give Kissinger advice on policy, particularly with regard to
                    Russia and Europe. We would often do joint memoranda with other bureaus, and I
                    would certainly work closely with INR on things like the alert list or anything
                    else involving looking ahead. That's a very good point.</p>
                <p>Certain S/P roles overlap. For example, contingency planning. This could involve
                    consideration of what we can do if something goes wrong or, instead of this
                    happening, something else happens. For example, we might reach an agreement with
                    such and such a country, and they start to violate the agreement. Or things are
                    looking uneasy in this or that country. What do we do if the regime is
                    overthrown? We did that kind of contingency planning.</p>
                <p>Certainly, we wouldn't always do this ourselves but we would try to think
                    systematically about a given issue and make sure that the bureau involved was
                    looking at this contingency, or we would work with the bureau or as part of some
                    interagency process.</p>
                <p>Then, another area where we had a lot to do was to take the lead on issues which
                    cut across the interests of several bureaus or several agencies. Let's say,
                    nuclear non-proliferation, where you have the Bureau of Political-Military
                    Affairs, the regional bureaus covering the countries concerned, and the Bureau
                    of Scientific and Technological Affairs, which gets into nuclear issues. The
                    Bureaus of Economics, Congressional Relations, and Public Affairs might be
                    involved as well. This is just one example.</p>
                <p>Or take the energy issue, where you have the Bureau of Economic Affairs involved,
                    but the key regional bureaus are also affected. Or dealing with the Third World
                    generally on matters which cut across the concerns of several bureaus. Or the
                    Law of the Sea, which involves the Office of the Legal Adviser of the Department
                    but there are also military and economic interests to consider as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0373" n="Page0373"/>
                <p>I saw an opportunity, and we managed to do this, to be the leader among several
                    bureaus on some of these issues. There might be a variety of interests involved
                    here. You might give one bureau authority to handle such a matter, as opposed to
                    another bureau, like the Bureau of Political and Military Affairs, versus a
                    regional bureau. But this gives an issue an emphasis which is unfair; in this
                    case, you may damage our relations with some country in terms of bilateral
                    interests. Or take the subject of arms control. If you give the responsibility
                    to the regional bureau, then the issue of arms control gets less attention
                    because the regional bureau may not want to hurt their clients.</p>
                <p>So Policy Planning could serve as a sort of honest broker, sitting on the Seventh
                    Floor, looking at the issue from the global perspective of the President and the
                    Secretary of State. The bureaus could feel that, at least, we would be an honest
                    or somewhat more detached, e.g., on human rights.</p>
                <p>So, particularly on issues which I have mentioned, which cut across the interests
                    of several bureaus, we often took the lead and made sure that every bureau with
                    an interest in a given matter was fairly represented in discussing a given
                    subject and had an opportunity to express its views. We would then send a memo
                    to the Secretary, indicating the views of the various bureaus. Just as the NSC
                    [National Security Council] is supposed to do that for the government as a
                    whole. The NSC could send a memorandum to the President, stating that this is
                    what the various agencies think. In policy planning we tried to perform that
                    function within the Department of State and do it as fairly as we could, without
                    losing our influence on the process. We would surely have our own views and make
                    these clear while presenting the others fairly. The Secretary deserves to have a
                    fair presentation of views on a given issue.</p>
                <p>A lot of these issues, including somewhat newer issues such as Law of the Sea,
                    energy, non-proliferation, and the Third World, may not sound new now, but they
                    certainly were in the mid 1970s. On these issues we often took the lead, and our
                    people had the time and chance to give serious thought to some of these matters
                    with which the US didn't have that much historical experience. That was also
                    true of the allocation of resources. We took the lead on that, together with the
                    management people, when they were looking for a substantive input to the
                    financial aspects. Here again we provided the global, more detached perspective
                    and therefore took the lead.</p>
                <p>One issue which received attention and where S/P played a central role along with
                    the economic bureau and others, was energy. There was an energy crisis in 1974
                    and Kissinger convened a major conference in Washington of the importing
                    nations. This was heavily European, and I remember some very hostile jostling
                    between Kissinger and the obnoxious French foreign minister, Jobert. Kissinger
                    called in David Bruce and others as counselors. Over several months there were
                    many consultations, speeches, new projects that were developed, essentially to
                    gain leverage against OPEC. S/P and I were in the middle of this.</p>
                <pb facs="0374" n="Page0374"/>
                <p>Another area was to act as devil's advocate. I always instructed my people to see
                    whether a policy was going off course or whether there was something better that
                    we could do. Again, I always worked in cooperation with the bureau involved. I
                    wouldn't blind side them. However, I wanted to make sure that we didn't just
                    continue along the current course, if there were some problems with it. We would
                    do this, as I say, in conjunction with the bureau, if necessary. If there was
                    resistance, then ultimately I would use my stick and send a memorandum to the
                    Secretary of State to express my concern. In that case I would always send a
                    drop copy to the Assistant Secretary of the bureau concerned so that he or she
                    knew what I was doing. As I say, I wouldn't blind side them. They would always
                    know what was going to happen, and I made sure that they got a copy of the
                    memorandum.</p>
                <p>I don't want to pretend that everything was harmonious. I think that, on the
                    whole, we had very good relations with the various regional and functional
                    bureaus. However, some bureaus were more suspicious of us and less cooperative
                    than others. I think that, on the whole, we did quite well. We could have more
                    influence where we had really good people. For example, the Latin American
                    Bureau realized that Luigi Einaudi was a terrific guy to work with on Latin
                    America. Obviously, the East Asian and Pacific Bureau valued my background and
                    clout on China. In the case of the Middle East, very strong people like Roy
                    Atherton, Hal Saunders, and Joe Sisco were already available to the Secretary,
                    though I did go on the two Egyptian shuttles. So there were some areas where we
                    had more impact and cooperation than others.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned your various deputies. Were they your principal points of
                    contact with the bureaus? Did they sit in and keep in contact with the
                    bureaus?</p>
                <p>LORD: No, this was one step below that. I usually had two deputies. Then I had
                    one or two people covering each of the geographic regions or functional issues,
                    and I have indicated who some of them were. They would sit in on staff meetings
                    and coordinate with the various bureaus. I basically split up responsibilities,
                    for example, when I had Reg Bartholomew and Sam Lewis working with me: on a
                    regional basis Lewis followed Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia,
                    plus economic affairs, and was my principal deputy. Bartholomew followed Europe,
                    Russia, Asia, and political-military affairs. However, it would basically be
                    people one step below them who would be in day to day contact with the various
                    bureaus, as well as with other agencies.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you talk a bit about your impression of the response of the various
                    regional and functional bureaus when Kissinger was Secretary of State? I've
                    often heard it said that you could almost rank the bureaus in this sense. Could
                    you give us a feel for how you felt about how well they worked under Secretary
                    Kissinger?</p>
                <pb facs="0375" n="Page0375"/>
                <p>LORD: I have to be careful about this. We are talking about a period some 25
                    years ago. Sometimes the reputation of a bureau depends on the leadership of the
                    bureau. Obviously, the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs was a classic example of a
                    very expert operation. Joe Sisco, of course, was Undersecretary of State for
                    Political Affairs and was very heavily involved in Near Eastern affairs, and Roy
                    Atherton and Hal Saunders were also involved in it. There was capable support
                    underneath them. That was a very classy bureau. The Near Eastern bureau did an
                    excellent job of supporting Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy.</p>
                <p>Tom Enders and the people in the Bureau of Economic Affairs also did an excellent
                    job. Tom was one of the most brilliant Foreign Service officers that I have ever
                    met.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Secretary Kissinger respond to economic
                        issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: He developed a better understanding of them. There were a lot of jokes
                    about how little attention he paid to economic affairs. At the NSC, you could
                    talk to Bob Hormats and Fred Bergstren, both of whom worked there; they would
                    say that Kissinger didn't spend a great deal of time on economic matters. At
                    State, however, he began to understand the importance of economic issues and
                    began to get more on top of them. He realized this clearly on the energy issue
                    and at the G7 Summit Meetings. He had great respect for Tom Enders, Chuck
                    Robinson, and Bill Rogers, Undersecretaries of State for Economics. Not only was
                    Enders brilliant and creative and gave Kissinger a lot of substantive ideas, but
                    he was a tough person who would argue back with Kissinger and often on turf that
                    Tom was more familiar with than Henry was. Kissinger began to be more familiar
                    with economic issues and realized more and more how important they were. Of
                    course, it's a clich� now in the 1990s to say how important economics is, but
                    even in the 1970s economic issues were important. However, during the Cold War,
                    the balance of power was so important, and the economy was much less globalized
                    than it is now, in terms of our dependence on exports and foreign investment.
                    Now there is also the impact of the Internet on economic affairs. Back in the
                    early 1970s you could make the point that political and security matters were
                    more important than economic problems, while you can make the case now that
                    economics have risen to the top of the agenda.</p>
                <p>Actually, I can't think of a weak bureau in the State Department of that time.
                    All of them performed well at least on some issues. For example, in Africa we
                    made major strides on Rhodesia and reached a settlement there. Henry Kissinger's
                    speech at Lusaka reflected a change in our policy. That speech received
                    widespread approval. I think that S/P gave great help there, given the
                    geopolitical dimension. On Asia he had good support on China, for example, from
                    the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs and myself. In dealing with the
                    Russians he had good support from the Bureau of European Affairs.I'm not trying
                    to be popular by not criticizing anybody, but I think that, on the whole, since
                    Kissinger picked good people, in general he had pretty good support.</p>
                <pb facs="0376" n="Page0376"/>
                <p>Q: I'm thinking of two things that come to mind which have arisen in these
                    interviews. One was when I believe that Kissinger went to Mexico City and
                    discovered that our Ambassadors attending a Chiefs of Mission Conference didn't
                    seem to take much interest in NATO and East-West affairs. This launched the
                    Global Perspectives program. I wonder if you could comment on that.</p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. This gets a little bit away from policy, but that's all right. That's
                    a good question, and there are some other roles that I want to get at. Kissinger
                    felt that it was important that people not be overly parochial or subject to
                    clientitis. He would often encounter people who provided examples of this. He
                    understood, for example, the need for regional specialists who would promote his
                    or her regional interests. However, he felt that it was important for FSOs not
                    to become overly preoccupied with particular regions or issues. So when he was
                    Secretary of State, he felt that it was important to move people around now and
                    then in the course of their careers so that they would have a more global
                    perspective. I've forgotten the name of the program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was called GLOP [Global Perspectives].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Of course, you have to strike a balance, and I think that he understood
                    that. You don't want someone who speaks brilliant Chinese or Japanese and then
                    have them spend 20 years in South America. Kissinger understood the need for
                    regional expertise, but he felt that it was important for people to have a
                    little bit of a sense of the global perspective of the President and the
                    Secretary of State and not be overly parochial in their views. So that program
                    was instituted. I'm sure that there were different views on how successful it
                    was.</p>
                <p>Frankly, when he came in as Secretary of State, I don't recall how narrowly
                    specialized people were anyway. I'm not sure that they were all that narrowly
                    specialized.</p>
                <p>Q: I think that Latin America is a special case. As far as I can recall, Foreign
                    Service officers and people who go to Latin America seem almost to disappear as
                    if they had entered a black hole. You almost never saw them again in other areas
                    of the world.</p>
                <pb facs="0377" n="Page0377"/>
                <p>LORD: That's a good point. There used to be a sort of pecking order, which I
                    think has begun to disappear during the past decade or so. The so-called best
                    officers and the ones who got the most attention were assigned to Europe. Then,
                    gradually, people assigned to Asia began to attract more attention. However, the
                    view went that people who were assigned to Latin America and Africa tended to be
                    second rate officers. People assigned to the Middle East were more highly
                    regarded. This categorization was very unfair, of course, but you're absolutely
                    right that this view was widely held. I frankly would hesitate now to figure out
                    whether there was some reality to this view. That is, whether less qualified
                    officers were assigned to those bureaus. I would have to say, in all fairness
                    and without generalizing that, on the whole, a lot of the stronger or better
                    qualified officers served in the European, Asian, and Middle Eastern
                    Bureaus.</p>
                <p>Q: Or, as officers were assigned to Latin America and Africa, they somehow didn't
                    gain much attention, because the major crises weren't there.</p>
                <p>LORD: It's sort of a vicious circle.</p>
                <p>Q: That's right, but this raises another question. You have described your
                    working with Kissinger. However, I've gotten the impression from interviewing
                    other officers that they felt that Kissinger had his own mind set, which was
                    European and Cold War oriented. He was often regarded as trying to shoe horn
                    problems in the Middle East, Africa, or Latin America, and particularly places
                    that he didn't pay much attention to, into the framework of East-West conflict,
                    when actually these problems were often local. I think that this practice
                    sometimes skewed our policy. I would have thought that in policy planning you
                    might have found yourself in the position of saying that you can forget about
                    this East-West stuff. For example, the Syrians just don't like the Iraqis, and
                    this has nothing to do with...</p>
                <p>LORD: I don't want to claim more than we should about the role of policy
                    planning. However, in one sense you are absolutely right about this. In the case
                    of the southern African problem, we were trying to indicate to the Bureau of
                    African Affairs that it should pay attention to the geopolitical and East-West
                    aspects of a problem to get Kissinger's attention. And also for legitimate
                    reasons, not just to get Kissinger's attention. However, our obligation also was
                    to try to educate Kissinger, if that doesn't sound too presumptuous, about the
                    fact that there were other things involved here beside the East-West dimension.
                    Whether it is in terms of the interests, practices or customs of the countries
                    that you are dealing with, or what American policy should be, you have to take
                    other factors into account.</p>
                <p>Now, in terms of a basic criticism of Kissinger's outlook, without getting more
                    specific, there probably is some element of truth in that. Kissinger might well
                    have overemphasized the East-West aspect of foreign policy. However, you have to
                    remember that we are talking about the early and mid-1970s and the very
                    competitive, global tension which existed with the Russians.</p>
                <pb facs="0378" n="Page0378"/>
                <p>In terms of the Middle East, he saw the situation there as an end in itself, in
                    the sense of our energy needs, our interest in oil, our interest in not having
                    war break out which could drag in the United States, as well as our fidelity to
                    Israel. Kissinger also saw the Middle East as an area of competition with the
                    Russians, as well as those countries which were more friendly to the Russians,
                    such as the Syrians and the more radical countries. In his Middle East diplomacy
                    Kissinger very consciously tried to keep the Russians out of the Middle East as
                    much as possible.</p>
                <p>We often served as a buffer or transmission belt between some of the views held
                    in the Department of State and Kissinger's mind set. Having said that, and I
                    don't want to exaggerate it, I think that it is fair to say, and I'll come back
                    to that a little bit later, that Kissinger, as Secretary of State, paid much
                    more attention to some of these other considerations. Even he, with his almost
                    superhuman energy and intelligence, a great staff, and the backing of Presidents
                    Nixon and Ford at the White House, couldn't run the whole world. Basically, when
                    he was in the White House as National Security Adviser, he spent the great bulk
                    of his time on Vietnam, China, Russia, and, to a certain extent, the Middle
                    East. When he became Secretary of State, he concentrated to a considerable
                    extent on Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and even on Africa, on which
                    he spent a large amount of time during the last couple of years he was in
                    office.</p>
                <p>He also addressed newer issues, including some of those I mentioned, such as
                    energy, Law of the Sea, nuclear non-proliferation, North-South relations, and so
                    on. Our S/P staff played a major role on all these 'newer' issues. He probably
                    did this because these issues needed more attention after the preoccupations of
                    the first Nixon term and partly because some of our other issues were running
                    out of steam under the impact of the Watergate Affair. For example, we really
                    couldn't move much further with the Chinese for the time being, and d�tente with
                    the Russians was running into trouble. In this situation executive power was
                    severely diminished because of the Watergate Affair. President Ford was in a
                    caretaker position in many ways. Kissinger saw part of his role to be addressing
                    these other issues and to highlight the agenda for the future. Indeed, he gave a
                    lot of speeches on these issues, precisely because he saw the need to address
                    these issues which were coming up and also because of the intensity of the
                    attacks from the Right and the Left, the role of Congress in attempting to
                    micromanage foreign policy, the reaction of Congress to the Watergate Affair,
                    the CIA excesses and investigations. Other considerations included the Vietnam
                    War and its aftermath and the collapse of the Paris Accords that, it had been
                    hoped, would terminate the problems caused by the war. We really were running
                    out of steam on many of these issues of the first Nixon term.</p>
                <p>So Kissinger began to pay more attention to some of these issues, not all of them
                    in the context of the East-West struggle. Issues like energy, Law of the Sea, or
                    non-proliferation were not issues which had much in the way of East-West
                    dimensions. These are very good questions.</p>
                <pb facs="0379" n="Page0379"/>
                <p>Let me make one other point about Kissinger's relationship to the Foreign
                    Service. I was talking about the Washington scene. There is no question that, on
                    the whole, with Ambassadors he was not the most benign interlocutor. Now, there
                    were exceptions. If he had confidence in an American Ambassador, then he would
                    make full use of him. A good example of this was Ambassador Herman Eilts in
                    Egypt. He worked very closely with him and had the utmost respect for him. He
                    listened to his views and Eilts was fully plugged in to his concerns. But with
                    other American Ambassadors Kissinger might even cut them out of the action. So,
                    on the whole, I think that his enlightened approach to the FSO and other career
                    communities in Washington was not repeated abroad. Kissinger often undercut
                    American Ambassadors, but he did not always do this. It depended on which
                    Ambassador you were talking about.</p>
                <p>Q: Also, I've interviewed people who have berated Secretary of State Kissinger
                    for cutting them down in front of other, State Department people. In other
                    words, if you were an Ambassador, you were the American representative in the
                    country to which you were accredited. Either he would make little use of them or
                    might say openly that we don't pay much attention to them. However, he would
                    leave them in office to deal with their country of accreditation. These people I
                    am speaking of have told me that Kissinger didn't seem to understand the
                    importance of having someone as Ambassador who had the respect of the country to
                    which he or she was accredited.</p>
                <p>LORD: I would not deny that. Again, this situation worked both ways. In the case
                    of someone like Ambassador Herman Eilts, who was a good example in my mind,
                    Kissinger not only worked fully with him but, by his body language and the
                    actual statements he made, would support that Ambassador with local elected and
                    senior officials. He would say that this Ambassador had his total confidence and
                    that he was a great guy. Kissinger could be a major asset in certain cases. In
                    other cases, while I don't think that Kissinger went out of his way to be
                    insulting but he was making clear to local officials that he, Kissinger, was the
                    one to deal with, and the Ambassador was someone essentially irrelevant. In
                    these cases, by definition, he was cutting them down.</p>
                <p>I don't think that Kissinger went so far as to go around saying to local
                    Presidents and Prime Ministers that the American Ambassador was irrelevant.
                    However, he could certainly indicate by his actions that the Ambassador
                    concerned was not in the loop and truly involved. Moreover, in terms of his
                    personality, and I've discussed this in the context of Kissinger's time in the
                    White House as well as the State Department, Kissinger was intellectually
                    intimidating. He hated yes men. I think that's one reason that people like
                    myself, Sonnenfeldt, and Eagleburger lasted with him because we would talk back
                    to him. But he also hated vacuous arguments. He had contempt for what he
                    considered poor arguments. It was not that people disagreed with him, which he
                    welcomed, but if they disagreed on sentimental or other grounds which had not
                    been well thought out, then Kissinger could be very contemptuous, including in
                    front of other people. This could be true of American Ambassadors or with State
                    Department and other agency people in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0380" n="Page0380"/>
                <p>There were a couple of other roles we played in policy planning. We would also,
                    and here we were not fully effective, stay in touch with other U.S. Government
                    agencies in planning and looking ahead in an effort to encourage that practice
                    with the other agencies. These other agencies included the NSC [National
                    Security Council], the Department of Defense, and the economic agencies, as well
                    as the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency]. I would occasionally meet my closest
                    counterparts in other agencies for lunch, sometimes with staff members, and we
                    would try to coordinate our views and share information. I am not trying to
                    suggest that we were doing this systematically on an interagency basis. But
                    Kissinger was the lead foreign policy person in the U.S. Government, and we
                    therefore had clout and some influence, as other agency representatives knew.
                    They knew that we were close to Kissinger and working for him.</p>
                <p>I also handled policy planning talks with other key countries. That process has
                    continued ever since. There had been some of that going on before I became
                    Director of Policy Planning in the State Department. I stepped up this process.
                    I did it both jointly with the Europeans as a whole and with individual European
                    countries, including the British, the French, and the Germans, as well as with
                    Japan. We worked with a couple of countries in Latin America, but these planning
                    discussions were conducted by Sam Lewis, my deputy.</p>
                <p>S/P played a central role in the shaping of resources/priorities in the budget
                    process with respect to goal-setting. This reflected our “honest broker”
                    capacity.</p>
                <p>There were a couple of other roles I would mention as a final point. Regarding
                    Kissinger's press conferences, we were in charge of pulling together in advance
                    possible questions and answers. Of course, we always worked with one or more
                    bureaus to get that done, and we played more of a coordinating role in this
                    case. Here too we were honest brokers if there were bureau disputes on the
                    replies. Of course, we worked with the Bureau of Public Affairs and other
                    bureaus.</p>
                <p>Finally, there was the issue of speech writing, which is a job often done by
                    Policy Planning Staffs. Some Secretaries of State have had special speech
                    writers who report directly to the Secretary. In any event, Kissinger wanted me
                    to be in charge of this function, so I had no choice. If I had a choice, I would
                    still have agreeThis is not necessarily true of all Policy Planning Staffs. If
                    the Secretary of State doesn't put too much stock in speeches or in public
                    affairs, which I think is a mistake, or if the speeches don't have much impact,
                    you can spend a lot of time writing material which isn't all that important. It
                    is not just the Director of Policy Planning who is involved, but the key,
                    substantive person in that area of the speech, as well as speechwriters on the
                    staff.</p>
                <p>Q: I've interviewed Ambassador Warren Zimmerman. Warren was saying that former
                    Secretary William Rogers told him: “Don't get me out ahead of anybody.” If you
                    don't want to be controversial, you've failed in your job.</p>
                <pb facs="0381" n="Page0381"/>
                <p>LORD: In such a case there is no great incentive to take on the job of Secretary
                    of State. Under Rogers I don't know whether S/PC [Policy Planning Council, as it
                    was then called] was directly under the Secretary. I'm almost sure that it was
                    off to one side in bureaucratic terms. I know that in Kissinger's case, and this
                    is important, he saw speeches as serving several purposes. First, he wanted to
                    build domestic public opinion and Congressional support for policy, explaining
                    and articulating that policy. Also, he wanted to explain our policies to other
                    countries around the world. He knew that, even if the speech did not get all
                    that much attention in the U.S., all of the foreign Embassies in Washington
                    would study it closely and send back commentaries on it to their capitals. He
                    also saw speeches as a way to get things done. If he was trying to launch a
                    policy or undertake some initiative, with the deadline for a speech coming up he
                    could often force the interagency process either to come up with creative ideas
                    or make decisions which even he, with his clout, couldn't pull off by
                    himself.</p>
                <p>A good example is a major speech which we drafted in August and September 1975.
                    It was right in the middle of an Egyptian shuttle. It was an incredibly
                    difficult process. There was a Special Session of the UN General Assembly
                    devoted to dealing with developing countries. Kissinger was supposed to deliver
                    the speech to the General Assembly himself, as he did every fall when the
                    General Assembly convened. In this case, since Kissinger was involved in a
                    shuttle initiative, Ambassador Moynihan delivered it on his behalf. For weeks,
                    if not months, before this speech was delivered, Assistant Secretary Tom Enders
                    and I were in the lead. Enders and his staff contributed many creative ideas, as
                    did my people as well.</p>
                <p>Kissinger was determined to present some creative ideas about dealing with the
                    Third World, as it was then called. He wanted imaginative ideas to promote
                    development and also American interests. With the deadline approaching for that
                    speech, he got the Departments of the Treasury, and Commerce, and the trade
                    people all butting heads to make sure that we had a creative speech. It was a
                    very good speech, and Kissinger used the deadline to get decisions made.</p>
                <p>Also in a speech Kissinger might undertake some major initiative or present some
                    explanation, such as our position on the Law of the Sea negotiations, or on
                    energy and what our approach was on that. Or he could be philosophical, as I
                    said, such as the role of morality versus pragmatism in foreign policy. I knew
                    instinctively, before we got to draft speeches that, over the coming years, this
                    would be an important process for policy impact. I had also worked personally on
                    the early drafts of speeches for President Nixon, particularly on Vietnam. The
                    speeches were then put into really good and effective English by the speech
                    writers on Nixon's staff. I could also write and edit fairly well. For all of
                    these reasons, speech writing became one of our roles.It didn't overly consume
                    us. I managed to get two, terrific writers from the Foreign Service, Charlie
                    Hill and Mark Palmer. They were both excellent. It's very hard to find good
                    speech writers anywhere in the world, and particularly in the Foreign Service,
                    frankly.</p>
                <pb facs="0382" n="Page0382"/>
                <p>Q: I have done a solo interview with Mark Palmer. I can't remember the details,
                    but there was an issue before the United Nations which he kept slipping into a
                    draft of a speech for Kissinger. He would put this reference in, Kissinger would
                    take it out, and he would put it back in again.</p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, that often happened between us and Kissinger. We took this
                    speechwriting role on for all of the reasons which I have mentioned. It was
                    agony to do this, because Kissinger is very demanding, given the importance he
                    attaches to speeches. It is one of his intellectual strengths.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, I was in the role more of orchestra leader rather than playing lead
                    violin. I was responsible for getting the speech drafts to him, and I would
                    supervise the process of preparing them. However, the tough work would be done
                    by Charlie Hill and by Mark Palmer, as well as by Peter Rodman, who was still on
                    the NSC [National Security Council] staff. Those three were the key people
                    involved in drafting the speeches. Of course, we would work with the relevant
                    bureau or bureaus involved in the State Department, as well as my own staff
                    person for that area. If it was a speech on Latin America, we would deal with
                    Pete Vaky, another Foreign Service officer whom I wish to mention, plus Einaudi,
                    myself, and one or more of the speech writers.</p>
                <p>Without question, drafting speeches of this kind was an agonizing process. We'd
                    usually have to work on the damned things on weekends, which was the time when
                    Kissinger could pay more attention to speeches. I'm a fanatic Redskin fan
                    [Washington, DC football team]. It seemed that it would never fail that on the
                    Sunday morning of the day when I was looking forward to watching the Redskin
                    game, I'd get a phone call from Kissinger, asking for another draft of the
                    speech in the works. It used to drive me crazy. Fortunately, I could work with
                    the other speech writers, suggesting to them how to present the early drafts of
                    the speech. I could react to Kissinger's comments and do a lot of the editing,
                    as opposed to doing a lot of creative writing myself, which is even tougher.
                    However, I had to do some of that.</p>
                <pb facs="0383" n="Page0383"/>
                <p>There's a story which I tell which is apocryphal, but it does capture Kissinger's
                    demands, whether I was writing for the President's foreign policy report, as we
                    did at the White House, or whether it involved drafting speeches in the State
                    Department. It goes like the following. Kissinger asked for a draft of a speech,
                    and I went in with a draft. He called me back in his office the next day and
                    say: “Is this the best that you can do?” I replied: “Henry, I thought so, but
                    let me go back and work on it some more.” So I went back, spent a few more days,
                    redrafted the speech, and brought it back to Kissinger. He called me the next
                    day and say: “Winston, are you really sure that you can't do better than this?”
                    I replied: “Henry, I thought so, but let me try it again.” This process went on
                    through 10 drafts. I finally brought the tenth draft to him. The next day he
                    called me in and said: “Now, look, I know you've been working on this, but are
                    you really sure that you can't do better and that this is the best you can do?”
                    I said, “Henry, damn it, this is the tenth draft. I've been beating my brains
                    out. There is no way that I can improve this. This is the best I can possibly
                    do, I promise you.” At this point Kissinger smiled at me and said, “In that
                    case, now I'll read the draft.”</p>
                <p>In drafting a speech I would get a group of people together, whom I have already
                    mentioned, including myself, a member of my staff, the key, regional people, the
                    functional people, and the speech writer or writers. Having guidance from
                    Kissinger, I would outline the speech he was going to give and the kind of
                    points he wanted to make in general terms. Sometimes this first meeting would be
                    chaired by Kissinger himself. By definition, for Kissinger, the first draft of a
                    speech or statement can't be any good. So we would submit our first draft to
                    him. He would generally call us in to his conference room, to go over the draft
                    with him. We knew that he was going to rant and rave about it. We just had to go
                    through the process.</p>
                <p>Usually, we'd have two or three of these sessions, during which he could be very
                    insulting. At best he would say: “Well, you're making some progress, but we need
                    to do a lot more work on it.” His attitude was never very encouraging. I would
                    always prepare my troops for the inevitable onslaught. If I thought that some of
                    the paragraphs were quite good and he didn't like them, I would tell them to
                    keep these paragraphs on hand, and we would put them back in a later draft, when
                    he might like them. We would do something to that effect.</p>
                <p>In all fairness, in the first place you had to give Kissinger credit for the
                    attention he devoted to this process. He could be in the middle of a crisis and
                    yet would work very hard on a speech. I'll repeat a good example. Right after he
                    became Secretary of State in October, 1973, the Yom Kippur War between Israelis
                    and Arabs broke out. Egypt [and Syria] attacked Israel, and so on. At the time
                    we were up at the UN and had two days to go before Kissinger was giving a major
                    speech in New York. This speech was to be delivered, not at the UN itself but on
                    and about the UN. Of course, Kissinger had to deal with the crisis arising out
                    of the Yom Kippur War, and he did. However, right in the middle of this crisis
                    he spent a couple of hours on his speech on the night that the latest
                    Israeli-Arab crisis broke out. This speech had nothing to do with the crisis.
                    However, he felt that the speech was very important, and you have to give him
                    credit for giving this much attention to it.</p>
                <pb facs="0384" n="Page0384"/>
                <p>Secondly, he was generally right about his speeches. When he said that some
                    passage was conventional, pap, or was vague, and that it contained the typical
                    exhortations of a State Department press release and nothing creative, he was
                    usually right about it. He could detect a passage which contained too little
                    thought, was too vague, or too conventional. He could spot a weak or rambling
                    structure. You have to give him credit for this, even though we used to get
                    absolutely furious with him because he would throw drafts on the floor or
                    denounce them as useless.</p>
                <p>In fact, the speech would get better as we went through this process. Kissinger's
                    ideas turned out generally to be pretty good. So, the process of drafting a
                    Kissinger speech was painful, but you could see the draft getting better and
                    better, thanks to his process of whiplashing us. And the further we went along
                    in the draft, and they would easily go through four or five drafts, while some
                    of them would go through 10 or 12 drafts, the more involved he became in the
                    process. Toward the end, he wasn't just giving us general, verbal instructions
                    or marking up a few sections, like “This is crap!” and we needed a more
                    conceptual approach. Kissinger began to get into the drafting process himself.
                    As we got closer to the final version of the speech, he would become more
                    involved in writing things. I would become more involved, as was Larry
                    Eagleburger at that point, in final editing. It was a terribly painful process
                    but I think that if you go back and look at his speeches, they were really quite
                    thoughtful and eloquent. No Secretary of State since (and probably before,
                    except perhaps Acheson) has devoted as much energy and thought and turned out
                    such thoughtful speeches in my view.</p>
                <p>S/P played an important role in drafting these speeches. Kissinger considered it
                    then very important, for reasons cited. As I have already stated, after the
                    Vietnam War and during the Ford Presidency, after Nixon left office, Kissinger
                    spent quite a bit of time going around the United States, trying to build
                    domestic support and understanding for our policies. There was a lot of focus on
                    looking ahead, as well as on some of the philosophical foundations of our
                    foreign policy.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, now, a speech is a speech. It's out there and it's nice, but who was
                    following through to see something happen to ensure that it was more than a
                    speech or that it signified a change in policy?</p>
                <pb facs="0385" n="Page0385"/>
                <p>LORD: That's a very good point. Generally, it was up to the regional and/or
                    functional bureau to implement whatever had to be done. That was one of the
                    roles of the Policy Planning Staff as well, to look at a speech and make sure
                    that whatever happened or was set out in the speech actually occurred. For
                    example, in the September 1975 developing country speech which was delivered by
                    Moynihan before the UN, we had initiatives to be pursued in the context of the
                    OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development], UNCTAD [UN
                    Conference on Trade and Economic Development], or GATT [General Agreement on
                    Tariffs and Trade]. We also proposed some new facilities and funds. We had to
                    make sure that not only the Department of State but the Departments of Commerce
                    or Agriculture or the Treasury Department were following up with what needed to
                    be done. Kissinger paid attention to this. Every now and then he would ask:
                    “Whatever happened to this or that initiative in my speech?”</p>
                <p>Other Kissinger speeches were more conceptual or policy breakthroughs. For
                    example, he gave a major speech in Lusaka [Zimbabwe], which we helped to draft,
                    together with people from the Bureau of African Affairs. This speech signaled a
                    change in American foreign policy, particularly under President Nixon and
                    Kissinger, who were not known for their preoccupation with human rights and
                    democracy. This speech really went a long way toward saying that America was
                    going to pay more attention to and be more sensitive to racial discrimination
                    and minority rule in Africa. It made some specific proposals on Rhodesia.
                    Rhodesia became independent Zimbabwe eventually as a result of Kissinger
                    diplomacy.</p>
                <p>So there were some Kissinger speeches which made their impact by virtue of a
                    shift in their strategic view. That was implemented by diplomacy, in fact, as we
                    continued to pursue what was signaled as a general, strategic direction in the
                    Lusaka speech. Than there were the more concrete directions in Kissinger's
                    speech to the UN General Assembly. Kissinger also gave a major speech at the
                    International Food Conference in Rome, in which he made major proposals. We had
                    to wrestle with the Department of Agriculture and others to get that done. Other
                    speeches - on Law of the Sea and energy, for example - set out American
                    proposals and positions that were pursued.</p>
                <p>You're absolutely right. You have to follow up and make sure that what was
                    promised is delivered. I think that, on the whole, this happened.</p>
                <p>Q: I've heard people express the wish that they could get something into a speech
                    by the Secretary of State or by the President, even if it was only one sentence.
                    Afterwards, from then on, they could follow that through by saying that the
                    Secretary of State or the President said this or that. You must have had people
                    from the regional and functional bureaus fighting to get that one sentence
                    in.</p>
                <pb facs="0386" n="Page0386"/>
                <p>LORD: That's a good point. If it was a good and creative idea, of course, we
                    would move forward with it. If Kissinger liked the idea, fine. However, if he
                    thought that it was some parochial idea that one of the bureaus was trying to
                    slip into his speech which didn't make sense, of course he would reject it. I
                    would like to make it very clear that on speech writing, like anything else that
                    we did with the geographic bureaus, we would never attempt to smother other
                    views. That would be self-defeating and wrong. If I were sitting in with
                    Kissinger and drafting a speech on Asia, Latin America, or whatever it was, and
                    the Assistant Secretary was also there, we might have disagreements. I might
                    say: “This idea ought to be in the speech.” The Assistant Secretary might say:
                    “No, this would make people mad,” or something like that. He would then have a
                    chance to present his views, both on what he wanted to include and what he
                    wanted to keep out of the speech.</p>
                <p>You are right that people tended to see that speeches by Kissinger were
                    important, not to mention speeches by the President. They would attempt either
                    to get their general views included in the speech or some, specific hobby horse
                    which they wanted to include.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that, from time to time as you went through this process, you
                    found, say, that the Bureau of African Affairs might want a particular line
                    included and that you might wait until the eighth draft to bring this idea back
                    in again and see that it was included?</p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, this happened. I can't give you a specific example, but there were
                    times when you would try to sense whether it was a good time to try to get
                    Kissinger to agree to include something. I don't want to be overly dramatic
                    about this, but it happened. However, we weren't just yes men. If we felt that
                    there was a good idea or approach which he had rejected, we would bring this
                    point back. I must say, to Kissinger's credit, that, not only did he not like
                    yes men, but he would consider opposing points of view, and even change his
                    mind.</p>
                <p>It would often happen that Kissinger would hear an argument and either keep
                    silent or say that he disagreed with it. Then you would see in a draft later on
                    or in his remarks at a subsequent meeting that he had actually adopted the
                    argument that he had heard previously and apparently rejected. He might never
                    acknowledge that he had been persuaded by this argument. Or he might say that,
                    on further reflection, that he had thought about it and been persuaded by this
                    argument. Often, he would not pick this point up on a later occasion, but
                    nevertheless, if he did, and you got the idea included in a speech or statement,
                    that was fine.</p>
                <p>I previously discussed earlier directors of the Policy Planning Staff. I started
                    with George Kennan, who was the first and the most senior. I had great respect
                    for him. One of the reasons I changed the name of the staff was to go back to
                    what it was called when he was director of the office. I specifically invoked
                    him in doing that, both out of my respect for him and out of a desire to have
                    the kind of clout or influence which his staff had previously had. Paul Nitze
                    came right after Kennan. I also talked to Paul and to other directors of the
                    policy planning staff, generally in chronological order.</p>
                <pb facs="0387" n="Page0387"/>
                <p>In Kennan's day, however, there were only about half a dozen people on the staff,
                    all senior officers, who had often served collectively with Secretary of State
                    Dean Acheson and Secretary of State George Marshall. I don't remember the exact
                    chronology. Frankly, the Policy Planning Staff under Kennan had a much narrower
                    agenda to deal with in terms of American foreign policy than we did, some
                    decades later. Clearly, that policy planning staff and George Kennan personally
                    played a seminal role in developing the Marshall Plan, NATO [North Atlantic
                    Treaty Organization], and in dealing with the Russians. I wouldn't want to
                    compare what the policy planning staff accomplished during my term of office
                    with what Kennan did. In any case, it was a different world.</p>
                <p>In our case we needed about 30 people on the Policy Planning Staff (increased
                    from 20 when I arrived) to cover all of the regions of the world and functional
                    issues. This was much larger than the staff was in Kennan's day. I met once or
                    twice a week with the whole policy planning staff so that I could talk to them
                    and say what I wanted from them, pat them on the back, fill them in, debate
                    issues, or whatever. We also met sometimes with Secretary Kissinger with a
                    couple of my key people on a given issue. There would also be representatives of
                    people from the regional bureaus at such meetings to discuss specific
                    issues.</p>
                <p>One good example was the range of Greek-Turkish issues, which broke out over
                    developments in Cyprus. We wrote a paper on these issues and had a discussion of
                    it with Secretary Kissinger. It was a pretty good discussion.</p>
                <p>There were some of these collective meetings, but usually they would involve
                    myself and my deputy discussing issues with Kissinger, as opposed to the
                    situation in Kennan's day. I think that at that time the Secretary of State met
                    fairly regularly with the Policy Planning Staff as a whole.</p>
                <p>There are different views as to how to put together a Policy Planning Staff. Did
                    you need a small staff of wise men and women who would meet regularly with the
                    Secretary of State and kick issues around? Or did you want the kind of larger
                    operation that we have had since that time and try to cover the various roles
                    that I have mentioned? There is a case to be made for either a larger or smaller
                    staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0388" n="Page0388"/>
                <p>Now, there is the general question of Kissinger's role during this period,
                    particularly in the wake of the Vietnam War and the Watergate crisis. We have
                    discussed Kissinger's contributions, first on Vietnam, China, and Russia, and
                    then on the Middle East and some other issues that he worked on. I personally
                    feel that probably Kissinger's single, greatest contribution as Secretary of
                    State was holding our foreign policy together in the wake of the Vietnam War and
                    the Watergate crisis. These crises brought a sense of disillusionment and a
                    negative perception of the government and everything related to it. There was an
                    evident lack of trust in the government and a growth of cynicism in America and
                    particularly toward the Executive Branch of the government.</p>
                <p>In reaction to this situation Congress asserted an increased role in the field of
                    foreign policy. The War Powers Act was passed in 1973 and there was a growth in
                    the tendency toward micro management of foreign policy on specific issues, with
                    Congress getting into both the tactics and strategy of foreign policy. There was
                    an investigation of the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] and its role in the
                    field of foreign policy. There was a general feeling by some supporters of
                    Senator McGovern that America ought to come home and that we had played too
                    negative a role in the world. There were others who felt that we were not being
                    robust enough in emphasizing human rights and other values. There were critical
                    hawks and doves on how to deal with Russia, including arms control.</p>
                <p>All of these developments created a very serious situation in the field of
                    foreign policy. Of course, the Nixon administration gave way to the Ford
                    administration. In his most recent volume of memoirs Kissinger has praised
                    President Ford for his having healed the nation. He regarded Ford's having
                    pardoned Nixon as correct, and courageous, since it may have cost him reelection
                    in 1976. He felt that, because of Ford's personality, he reestablished trust in
                    the Executive Branch of the government. Of course, I'm sure that Kissinger also
                    approved of President Ford because Ford delegated considerable authority to
                    Kissinger. For a time Kissinger wore two hats as National Security Adviser and
                    as Secretary of State. Later, Kissinger lost his hat as National Security
                    Adviser. Kissinger has strongly approved of President Ford's role during this
                    period.</p>
                <p>I personally feel that Ford contributed to healing the nation and that he was a
                    decent man. It took great courage on his part to pardon President Nixon. To some
                    extent Ford played the role that Kissinger has described, although I think that
                    Kissinger was too kind to Ford. I don't think that Ford was that great. Perhaps
                    no President at that point in time, following the Watergate Affair, could
                    possibly have done much. I sat in on meetings with President Ford and did not
                    feel that Ford was brilliant, to say the least, certainly by comparison with
                    President Nixon and some other Presidents I have worked with. I personally was
                    outraged at Ford's attempt to appease the Right Wing of the Republican Party by
                    dumping Nelson Rockefeller as his Vice Presidential candidate for the 1976
                    elections and replacing him with Senator Robert Dole. I was always a great fan
                    of Nelson Rockefeller. Also at times Ford seemed to distance himself from
                    Kissinger and the whole d�tente effort. Ford went to the Republican Convention
                    in 1976 and was preoccupied about the challenge to his position from Ronald
                    Reagan.</p>
                <pb facs="0389" n="Page0389"/>
                <p>So my view of President Ford is less elevated than Kissinger's, although I agree
                    that he was a decent man. I might be embarrassed if he heard or read these
                    comments, although I'll leave them in. I don't want to downplay President Ford's
                    contribution to healing the nation. I'm just not as enthusiastic about President
                    Ford as Kissinger is.</p>
                <p>Before we return to Kissinger, I want to be very fair to President Ford. Ford
                    also showed courage. A good example is his southern African diplomacy in 1975
                    and 1976. The conceptual and political watershed was Kissinger's Lusaka (Zambia)
                    speech of April 27, 1976. Kissinger spent a lot of time on this, and I was with
                    him, going all over Africa. Kissinger specifically tried to promote a settlement
                    in Southern Rhodesia which would lead to majority rule and to independence. The
                    breakthrough occurred during Kissinger's tenure although actual independence was
                    not achieved until after Ford and he left office. Ultimately, Southern Rhodesia
                    became independent as Zimbabwe. Kissinger also had to deal with the South
                    Africans to do this, as well as Ian Smith in Southern Rhodesia, in addition to
                    Black African leaders like Julius Nyerere, Kenneth Kaunda, Mobutu, and the
                    Kenyan leader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jomo Kenyatta.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Jomo Kenyatta, of course. All of this was quite dramatic, and I sat in on
                    all of these meetings during Kissinger's trip to Africa. This was coming to a
                    head during the presidential primaries in 1976 when Ronald Reagan was
                    challenging President Ford. I find this hard to believe but, apparently,
                    southern African diplomacy and the push for majority rule in Rhodesia, as well
                    as black rights and majority rule, were considered significant issues in places
                    like Texas and other states in the southern part of the United States. You
                    wouldn't think that the people in those states would be that concerned about
                    such matters. It just shows you how far we've come in our society since
                    then.</p>
                <p>President Ford lost a closely contested primary election in Texas in 1976 and, I
                    believe, some other primary elections in other southern states. The outcome was
                    close enough so that Kissinger's diplomacy in southern Africa might have made
                    the difference. To Ford's credit, and Kissinger makes that point in his book,
                    Ford never once mentioned or tried to rein in Kissinger on what he was doing in
                    Africa regarding majority rule and black rights, even though Ford knew that it
                    would hurt him politically vis-�-vis the Right Wing of the Republican Party and
                    Ronald Reagan, especially in the southern primaries.</p>
                <p>I remember specifically that we were traveling in Africa during the presidential
                    primary campaign in Texas. I think that we arrived in Ivory Coast at the time,
                    got off the plane, and were greeted by the press. President Ford had just lost
                    the primary election to Reagan in Texas. The press representatives began to sing
                    to Kissinger, “The eyes of Texas are upon you.” I want to give President Ford
                    his due. I don't want to be too negative.</p>
                <pb facs="0390" n="Page0390"/>
                <p>To get back to Kissinger's role at this time. It's hard to remember now, but
                    everyone knew that Kissinger, despite the wire tapping and some of the other
                    elements at the time, was completely removed from the Watergate Affair and that
                    he had nothing to do with that. Everyone realized the major contributions
                    Kissinger had made and everyone was looking for someone to trust during this
                    period. Already, of course, particularly on the liberal side, there was some
                    angst [concern] about Kissinger. And some of the conservatives felt that he
                    wasn't tough enough on the ideological and human rights front. However, on the
                    whole, he was the most respected and popular man in America. He was on countless
                    magazine covers. Equally important, of course, was that many people respected
                    him overseas. Those who depended on American credibility and steadiness saw in
                    Kissinger continuity from the Nixon into the Ford era. They saw someone who was
                    able to carry on, despite the fallout from the Watergate Affair and from the
                    Vietnam War, as well as the growing Congressional ascendancy in foreign policy,
                    in addition to all of the other problems that I have mentioned. So Kissinger's
                    holding this country together by virtue of his personality and prestige, making
                    sure that our foreign policy didn't fall apart, was very important, in addition
                    to his other accomplishments.</p>
                <p>In addition to some of the Middle Eastern shuttle diplomacy trips and attention
                    to some of these new issues which I have mentioned, as well as a host of other
                    issues where we either prevented damage or even made progress, I think that
                    Kissinger's general role of promoting trust and holding things together cannot
                    be underestimated. Kissinger faced all of the problems that I have mentioned and
                    managed to keep our foreign policy going.</p>
                <p>Some people say that Kissinger was one of our greatest Secretaries of State. I
                    think that is the wrong question because you have to look at Kissinger's
                    contributions both in terms of his White House years as National Security
                    Adviser and his years as Secretary of State. By the time Kissinger was Secretary
                    of State, the Watergate Affair and other issues very quickly overtook us. I
                    think that these issues constrained Kissinger, even though he made major
                    contributions in the Middle East and elsewhere. I think that you have to look at
                    his overall contributions during both the White House and State Department
                    years. After all, it was while he was National Security Advisor that we opened
                    to China, advanced 'd�tente' with the Soviet Union, and ended the Vietnam War.
                    In that sense I think that Kissinger was surely one of our greatest diplomats.
                    However, just as Secretary of State alone, I'm not sure that you can make as
                    convincing a case in terms of his actual accomplishments. Even as Secretary of
                    State I think that his record was outstanding because of his more general role,
                    which I've mentioned, of holding things together, as well as progress on issues
                    like the Middle East.</p>
                <pb facs="0391" n="Page0391"/>
                <p>There was no question that we slowed down in terms of developing relations with
                    China in 1975 and 1976. President Ford was worried about the challenge from
                    Governor Ronald Reagan and didn't want to take on the Taiwan issue. In turn,
                    China was going through its own transition, with Zhou En-lai and Mao Zedong
                    sick, and then dying in 1976, and the struggle between the pragmatists like Deng
                    Xiaoping, versus the Gang of Four, led by Mao's wife. D�tente with the Soviet
                    Union was under assault from the conservatives or neo-conservatives like Senator
                    Henry Jackson [Democrat, Washington state] and others who gave priority to
                    Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union to Israel as one of the conditions for
                    extending MFN [Most Favored Nation] treatment to Soviet products imported into
                    the United States. These conservatives also opposed arms control agreements with
                    the Soviet Union and thus were taking away some of the carrots we had proffered
                    to the Soviets.</p>
                <p>At the same time the liberals in Congress and the Left were hurting our Soviet
                    policy by cutting our defense budget and making us less robust and less of a
                    threat to the Soviets. So the sticks and carrots we had intended to use with the
                    Soviets were under attack. There was also the feeling that we had not been tough
                    enough with the Russians in the field of human rights.</p>
                <p>So our d�tente policy with the Soviets was running out of steam. Our China policy
                    was also running out of steam. The Vietnam settlement of 1973 was unraveling.
                    You could argue whether the agreement with Vietnam was realistic and good
                    enough. I've already explained that it seemed to us that it was the best we
                    could get. You could also argue how much of this deterioration was due to the
                    growth of Congressional authority and lack of trust in the Executive Branch.
                    However, the fact that Hanoi didn't have to fear American retaliation because
                    Congress sharply cut and then virtually eliminated both military and economic
                    aid to South Vietnam and opposed any bombing in response to Hanoi's violations
                    of the 1973 agreement were also major factors. Indeed, Kissinger cites Watergate
                    as single-handedly undermining the Paris Agreement, encouraging Hanoi to attack
                    the South without fear of American retaliation because of the weakened
                    Presidency. I agree that Watergate was a major factor but the American people
                    and Congress had lost staying power on Vietnam, with or without Watergate.</p>
                <p>This was a very difficult period for Kissinger. I think that you have to
                    recognize that he was a major figure and influence holding us together during
                    this very difficult period. I think that was Kissinger's greatest, single
                    contribution to American foreign policy during his service as Secretary of
                    State.</p>
                <p>Of course, there were also individual achievements, particularly in the Middle
                    East and Southern Africa, during that time, for which Kissinger deserves great
                    credit as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you want to turn to specific areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Have I answered your general question?</p>
                <pb facs="0392" n="Page0392"/>
                <p>Q: The other question was whether you saw Kissinger's mind set as being
                    consistently European? The European mind set is usually rather pessimistic,
                    whereas the American mind set tends to be rather optimistic. From your point of
                    view in policy planning, was there any yin and yang contrast in this
                    respect?</p>
                <p>LORD: Not so much in policy planning, but that is a fair statement in the sense
                    that Kissinger, as an historian in general and as a European expert, had a sense
                    of tragedy which most Americans don't have. Except for our Civil War and the
                    mistreatment of American Indians and then American blacks, on the whole we've
                    been rather blessed by virtue of geography and history. We don't have a sense of
                    tragedy. We've never had an external war fought on our territory. Europe, of
                    course, has gone through hell for centuries. So Kissinger always had more of a
                    sense of the finite, the tragic, and the historical than most Americans with
                    their generally idealistic outlook. You're absolutely right about this.</p>
                <p>This is one reason why Kissinger was suspicious of excessive exuberance,
                    particularly of Wilsonian ideas of pressing for the acceptance of our values
                    abroad, in terms of what's possible and the need for a balance of power. That
                    was clearly a sub-text, both personally, historically, and emotionally in
                    Kissinger's outlook.</p>
                <p>It would not be fair to say that Kissinger was a total pessimist. He was strongly
                    aware of America's strengths, both ideological and material, and he felt equally
                    strongly that America had a major role to play in the world. However, I think
                    that this meant that he basically felt that you could only deal with countries,
                    based on their external actions and what they did in the world, and you
                    shouldn't try to mess around too much with their domestic structures. Therefore,
                    that is why Kissinger paid more attention to realpolitik and the balance of
                    power than he did to human rights. This tendency got him into some domestic
                    trouble in an American democracy where people wanted these elements
                    included.</p>
                <p>Q: You were sort of a product of America. Did you find, in the field of policy
                    planning, that you were saying to Kissinger: “Lighten up, Henry, America has
                    something to sell.” Did you say this kind of thing to Kissinger?</p>
                <p>LORD: I don't think that we presented matters in that way. It may have informed
                    some of the specific issues that we discussed in ways that are hard to determine
                    now. I don't want to exaggerate our role at that kind of cosmic level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There may be nuances here. Did you find that? Mark Palmer
                        walooking at people, rather than power.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0393" n="Page0393"/>
                <p>LORD: There would be some elements there which we tried to introduce. Sometimes,
                    Kissinger would accept them and sometimes not. However, I don't want to pretend
                    that this was a major, philosophical debate, at least on the surface.
                    Nevertheless, the debate took place around specific issues. It would reflect
                    itself and, perhaps, either one of the bureaus or the policy planning staff
                    would pay more attention to values, democracy, and human rights than Kissinger
                    normally would. He might accept some aspects of this and not other aspects.
                    Kissinger did address this issue of values and interests, pragmatism and
                    moralism head-on in his Minneapolis speech. He would always grant a role for
                    values in our policies.</p>
                <p>I don't think that it would be right to say that Kissinger was pessimistic, but
                    he was aware of limits. Part of that was accentuated, of course, by the erosion
                    of executive authority because of the Watergate Affair and the fallout from the
                    Vietnam War and the expansion of the role of Congress in the field of foreign
                    policy. There were cuts in our defense budget, and we also found ourselves
                    unable to make concessions, either. So that perhaps also gave him a greater
                    sense of what we might accomplish. You should remember that, as Kissinger came
                    into office, he already felt philosophically, before the impact of the Watergate
                    Affair and the full impact of the Vietnam War, although it had already had some
                    impact, that America could not forever be the sole leader of the Free World, so
                    to speak. Already there was some danger that the American people would become
                    fatigued over this role. A tendency in this direction had already started to
                    become noticeable in the late 1960s, and this role had already gone on for two
                    decades. People had become fatigued at the burdens, financially and in other
                    aspects, e.g. psychologically. We were heavily engaged and trying to do
                    everything, virtually everywhere.So, as I said in earlier interviews, Kissinger
                    stressed the need for our allies to do more. There was the whole Nixon Doctrine
                    and the tendency to look to other countries to provide combat troops. We would
                    provide the nuclear umbrella, foreign aid, and military assistance to support
                    this effort. There was a general feeling in the United States that Japan and
                    Western Europe were becoming stronger and that they should pick up more of the
                    burden of the Western partnership. So these were constant themes, even before
                    the Watergate Affair and the Vietnam War. I think that Kissinger clearly felt
                    that America had to be the leader. However, domestically and for equity reasons
                    he felt that we should look to our allies to assume more of the burden, in the
                    emerging, multi-polar world.</p>
                <p>President Nixon himself gave a speech in Kansas City in the early 1970's, in
                    which he said that five centers of power were emerging, and this was 25 years
                    ago. He said that these centers consisted of Western Europe, Japan, China,
                    Russia, and the United States. He said that we were beginning to move from a
                    bipolar to a multipolar world. I don't think that you could call this pessimism;
                    it was a realistic analysis that the American people and Congress, even before
                    the Vietnam War and the Watergate Affair, but certainly afterwards, were not
                    prepared to do everything in the world. And now that Europe and Japan had become
                    strong, they should shoulder more responsibilities. This in time would encourage
                    the American people and Congress to continue to do our share.</p>
                <pb facs="0394" n="Page0394"/>
                <p>That's also one of the reasons why he felt that it was important to open up to
                    China and try to achieve more diplomatic flexibility, so that we could also meet
                    these challenges in a more sophisticated way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You refer to trips. The Policy Planning Staff would not
                        seem thave been a trip- oriented organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No, and it shouldn't be, in my opinion. That kind of activity leads to one
                    becoming operationally oriented. Now, having said that, I was told that I could
                    go on any trip that I wanted to make. Partly, these trips were fun and exciting.
                    The trips with Secretary Kissinger were also very important. And they gave me
                    policy impact, partly because they provided me with access to Secretary
                    Kissinger himself and to his staff and reinforced my own reputation to others as
                    a close associate.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, we had a huge agenda and a lot of work to do in Washington.
                    Basically, the Director of the Policy Planning Staff was not in an operational
                    position, and our role was to look ahead, in my view. So, therefore, I tried to
                    strike a balance. I think that some of my successors went on too many trips,
                    while some went on too few. I think it's useful to go on a few trips, to get a
                    sense of the Secretary of State's thinking and to maintain your personal
                    relationship and access to him, as well as to demonstrate to people in the State
                    Department that you're one of the key players in the building. All of these
                    things are not insignificant. I probably went on about half of Secretary
                    Kissinger's trips.</p>
                <p>I of course went on all of his trips to China, in view of the fact that this was
                    my key specific portfolio item. He made several trips to China when he was
                    Secretary of State. I also went on some of the trips to the Soviet Union,
                    because they were important. I went on some trips that were multi-faceted. I
                    remember one trip when we went to Eastern Europe and the Middle East, ending up
                    in Rome at the World Food Conference. I went on both Egyptian shuttle diplomacy
                    trips, but thankfully I missed the trip to Syria, which was by far the longest.
                    Kissinger made three agreements on the Middle East, and I was involved in making
                    two of them. Having said that, I should add that I was clearly in a supporting
                    role. On the China trips I was the leading staff person, together with a
                    representative from the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs and with Dick
                    Solomon from the White House NSC [National Security Council] staff. On these
                    trips to East Asia I worked with Phil Habib or Art Hummel or Bill Gleysteen,
                    from the bureau, as well as Dick Solomon from the NSC staff. Obviously, I
                    remained the key China person.</p>
                <pb facs="0395" n="Page0395"/>
                <p>On a Russian trip I would be in a supporting role with Helmut Sonnenfeldt, Bill
                    Hyland, and Arthur Hartman. On a Middle East trip I played a supporting role
                    with Phil Habib, Joe Sisco, Roy Atherton, and Hal Saunders. However, I could
                    provide some perspective to the other people making these trips. I could remind
                    Secretary Kissinger of what the impact would be on other issues. I could be a
                    good spear carrier and, since I knew enough about the issues, I could help draft
                    memoranda and telegrams on some of these matters, if they needed help, although
                    they usually didn't, in most cases. I would sit in on all of the meetings.
                    Because Kissinger was a traveling Secretary of State, he was in constant touch
                    with Washington, in addition to what he was doing on a given trip. Lengthy
                    cables were going back and forth on other matters. These cables would be from
                    Kissinger's Deputy, from Larry Eagleburger [his Special Assistant], and so on.
                    These people would be taking care of business back in Washington, and some of
                    these matters involved questions that I was concerned with. In this sense
                    Kissinger could use me as a kind of utility infielder.</p>
                <p>I went on some of these trips for the reasons I have mentioned bunot on all of
                    them. It would have been a mistake if I had done so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Regarding the China trips, you say that you were a lead
                        player.What does that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0396" n="Page0396"/>
                <p>LORD: Well, I was a lead player on China throughout this period. I don't want to
                    say that I was the only specialist on China. Others from State and the NSC
                    played crucial roles, with deep background, and we always worked very well
                    together. However, I was the person whom Kissinger took to the meeting between
                    President Nixon and Mao Zedong, because I had been in charge of preparing the
                    briefing books for Nixon. Indeed, I went to all - five - meetings with Mao as
                    well as all meetings, hundreds of hours, with and Zhou and Deng Xiaoping. I want
                    to make it absolutely clear that John Holdridge played an absolutely central
                    role. He knew a lot more about China than I did. During Kissinger's State
                    Department years the Bureau of East Asian Affairs did a good part of the hard
                    work and provided the expertise, in addition to the work done by Phil Habib and
                    Art Hummel [Assistant Secretaries of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs],
                    as well as Dick Solomon, who was very helpful in the NSC in the White House.
                    However, the fact is I was involved in the effort to improve relations with
                    China from the beginning. I was very careful always to keep the Bureau of East
                    Asian and Pacific Affairs fully informed, e.g. there were times when Kissinger
                    wanted me to meet with the Chinese Ambassador. So basically, the way it worked
                    out, there would be a memorandum for Kissinger's China trip and what he sought
                    to accomplish. This would be a joint memo from me, as Director of the Policy
                    Planning Staff, and the Assistant Secretary of East Asian Affairs, which we
                    would agree on. The memo would also probably make it clear that it also was
                    approved by the NSC [National Security Council] because at this time Kissinger
                    was both National Security Adviser as well as Secretary of State. Indeed, we
                    worked jointly with Solomon of the NSC on these issues. It was interesting to
                    see that the memo would show that Kissinger, or later on his successor as
                    National Security Adviser, Brent Scowcroft, was in full agreement, as was Dick
                    Solomon, from the NSC staff. So this kind of memo on China was very
                    collaborative between the Bureau of East Asian Affairs, the NSC staff at the
                    White House, and myself as Director of Policy Planning. I think that it would be
                    fair to say that, by virtue of our personal relationships and my role over the
                    years on China, I was still the person, above all, whom Kissinger looked to on
                    China, but this was a collective operation. China was the one area where I
                    remained operational for the reasons I mentioned. I wouldn't try to be
                    operational on other areas.</p>
                <p>Even in the case of China, the heavy lifting in the sense of actual drafting of
                    the basic papers was done by officers in the Bureau of East Asian Affairs and
                    the White House, NSC staff. I would help to draft, or actually do the drafting,
                    on some of the strategy and conceptual approach involved. I would also go over
                    all of the documents involved. However, if Kissinger wanted one person at a
                    meeting with Mao Zedong, Zhou En-lai, or Deng Xiaoping, it would be me. Unlike
                    during the NSC days, when the State Department was often cut out of the
                    operation, the Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs was
                    usually included, which was good. The result was that it was a much more
                    comfortable and collaborative effort. It was a more comfortable situation,
                    unlike Kissinger's White House years, when we knew that we were cutting out our
                    State Department colleagues. Kissinger was now Secretary of State, and he
                    believed that the State Department should be at the center of the operation.</p>
                <pb facs="0397" n="Page0397"/>
                <p>The major trips that I recall therefore included the China trips, sometimes
                    paired with other stops. We also went to Japan on many occasions. Kissinger knew
                    that the opening to China was a shock to Japan. During Kissinger's term as
                    Secretary of State he paid a lot of attention to US relations with Japan. He met
                    with successive Japanese Foreign Ministers. We're talking about the situation 25
                    years ago. Now such meetings are more or less taken for granted. In a bilateral
                    sense Kissinger met with Japanese Foreign Ministers about ten times in just
                    about two years. Now, of course, there is an opportunity to do this, not only at
                    the UN General Assembly, but at regional security or economic meetings, which
                    provide the venue for meeting with the Japanese.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought that dealing with Japan was a little bit like dealing
                    with Italy. That is, governments keep changing and there is a collaborative form
                    of government. So it's really hard to go and talk to someone who is going to be
                    able to do anything.</p>
                <p>LORD: That is a very perceptive comment. I may have made this point earlier on in
                    this interview, but one reason we had a secret approach to the Chinese was due
                    to the sensitivity of the issues with China and Russia, and even Vietnam, during
                    Kissinger's White House years. Part of it was that Kissinger wanted to control
                    our policy. Partly it was because President Nixon wanted things to be handled in
                    a secret way. Nixon didn't want public comments or controversy. Part of the
                    reason also was that we were not dealing with democracies, to say the least.
                    Therefore, one or two leaders, or at least a few members of the Communist Party
                    Politburo in these three countries could decide and then implement what was
                    done.</p>
                <p>In democracies the process is a little messier. You have to do things openly and
                    involve more players. Japan is a classic example of this, but this situation is
                    even true in the European democracies. This is particularly true in Japan with
                    their collective approach to making decisions and the lack of dynamic prime
                    ministers in general, although there are some exceptions, such as Nakasone.
                    However, basically the Japanese come to decisions slowly and collectively.
                    You're absolutely right, that this process of decision making was something less
                    congenial to Kissinger. His critics would say that Kissinger was relatively
                    uncomfortable with democracies and with parliaments. These critics considered
                    that he would much rather have a dictator to deal with. When he dealt with
                    Japan, Kissinger recognized that these were crucial considerations. In fact, he
                    recognized that he and President Nixon had not treated the Japanese very well
                    during the period of the Nixon shocks, that is, the period prior to the opening
                    to China. He appreciated that some nurturing and tending of the relationship
                    with Japan was important. And he considered the Japanese our key ally in the
                    region, of course.</p>
                <p>Other trips, particularly those to the Middle East and especially the two
                    Egyptian shuttle trips I went on, were very dramatic. As I said, during the
                    second one of them we had to prepare a major speech to the United Nations at the
                    same time. That speech and the second Egyptian agreement came together on
                    September 1, 1975. That was truly an exhaustive time.</p>
                <pb facs="0398" n="Page0398"/>
                <p>The first Egyptian shuttle trip was also dramatic. I would like to spend a little
                    bit of time on that. The Yom Kippur War of 1973 broke out when Kissinger was up
                    at the UN. This is a good example of Kissinger taking a crisis and turning it
                    into an opportunity. As the Yom Kippur War unfolded over a period of some time,
                    Kissinger didn't want Israel to be overrun by Egypt. However, after a while,
                    when Israel began counterattacking and pushing the Egyptians back, Kissinger
                    recognized that if Israel totally defeated the Arabs, that wouldn't necessarily
                    be very good, either. What he did in that connection was to make sure that the
                    war stopped before either side scored a decisive victory. The Israelis had
                    managed to push back the Egyptians. They had surrounded the Egyptian Third Army,
                    and there was a real prospect that the Israelis would virtually wipe out the
                    Egyptians. If this happened, the Arabs and the Egyptians would be humiliated
                    once again, and Israel would have total self-confidence again. The psychological
                    climate would not be propitious for negotiations.</p>
                <p>Kissinger worked very hard on this. He quickly went to Moscow in this connection
                    to arrange a cease-fire before the Egyptian Army was wiped out. He did this for
                    the following reasons. He was already looking ahead to try to make progress on
                    negotiations between the Egyptians and the Israelis. Kissinger recognized that
                    here was a chance to achieve a psychological balance between the Israelis and
                    the Egyptians. He felt that the Egyptians could take some pride, and for the
                    first time, in having inflicted some heavy damage on the Israelis. They could
                    honestly say that they had not been defeated. The Arabs could feel some
                    satisfaction over this. At the same time the Arabs would recognize that, once
                    again, if it had not been for intervention by the U.S., they might have been
                    totally defeated by the Israelis. So, in Kissinger's view, the Arabs could feel
                    some pride and satisfaction over the Yom Kippur War and that they were dealing
                    from a position of some strength and not humiliation.</p>
                <p>Similarly, psychologically on the Israeli side, the Israelis were in serious
                    trouble, militarily, for the first time. Yes, the Israelis had made their usual
                    comeback from a position of some disadvantage, but in fact they weren't as
                    invincible as they thought they were. They felt that they could be a little more
                    flexible on the peace process, in order to ensure their own security. Kissinger
                    sought to freeze the situation at a point where both sides could claim some
                    victory and some satisfaction. The sense of humiliation was less on the Egyptian
                    side than before, in the sense that they were less vulnerable toward the
                    Israelis than before. Kissinger thought that this situation set up the
                    psychological framework for negotiations between the two sides. This was a
                    classic example of Kissinger understanding the nuances of the situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he articulating this situation to his staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0399" n="Page0399"/>
                <p>LORD: Absolutely. He told us that we cannot let the Egyptian Army be wiped out or
                    we would be right back to the previous position where Israel might think that it
                    doesn't have to negotiate, while the Egyptians and the Arabs might feel so
                    humiliated over the situation that they didn't dare negotiate. Kissinger
                    understood this, and it's a very good example of his thinking ahead, not to
                    mention the difficulties involved in going to Moscow and getting the Soviets to
                    agree to a cease-fire. Then he went to the Israelis, who didn't like the
                    situation and were tempted to wipe out the Egyptians again. It was not easy to
                    convince Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir that the Israelis had to stop at that
                    point, with the promise that we would then negotiate hard and engage in shuttle
                    diplomacy for this purpose.</p>
                <p>Q: Were the Office of Policy Planning and/or the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs
                    looking with new eyes on President Sadat of Egypt at this time? Remember, at the
                    time he was considered a sort of second rate Nasser.</p>
                <p>LORD: On these Kissinger trips to the Middle East, I was involved as a spear
                    carrier as I took part in the shuttle diplomacy exercise. I sat in on many of
                    the meetings, and so made some modest contribution. However, I want to make
                    clear that I didn't have as much background in terms of the Middle East. I
                    mentioned Bob Oakley, but he wasn't really a Middle East expert and was only
                    involved in this situation for a while. He helped us on other parts of this
                    negotiation regarding the Middle East, on terrorism, and so on. I didn't have
                    much depth of background on the Middle East, but other people in the Department
                    had the strength that they needed, so my role wasn't that great. But Kissinger
                    found me useful in all the other roles I mentioned.Now, regarding President
                    Sadat of Egypt, you're absolutely right. When he came into office as President
                    of Egypt, people asked: “Who is this guy?” They tended to figure that, after
                    Nasser, he would be something of an anticlimax, even thought they had a lot of
                    ambivalence about Nasser. He surprised everyone. There is no question that Sadat
                    showed incredible courage. Kissinger ended up with great admiration for Sadat,
                    and this applied to President Nixon, too. Eventually, Sadat paid for his courage
                    with his life. It was only gradually that Kissinger and others began to realize
                    what a great statesman and courageous man Sadat really was. However, at the
                    outset, I certainly didn't know enough about Sadat to understand this and I
                    don't believe that our Middle East experts appreciated this either. I think that
                    Sadat surprised everyone.</p>
                <p>The two Egyptian shuttle negotiations in 1974 and 1975 were really exhausting -
                    and rollercoasters of hope and despair. We not only went back and forth between
                    Cairo and Tel Aviv but also to other key capitals - Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia.
                    I recall the quiet courage of Hussein of Jordan, the maddening elusiveness of
                    Assad of Syria, the surreal Saudi dinners where everyone (all men, all in white)
                    would watch the King and eat/laugh when he would eat/laugh. Then there was the
                    charisma of Sadat and the excruciating demands of the Israelis, understandably
                    insecure.</p>
                <pb facs="0400" n="Page0400"/>
                <p>One more footnote. Again, it's somewhat humorous now, but it sure wasn't at the
                    time. During the trip to Moscow in October, 1973, we were trying to arrange a
                    cease-fire between the Israelis and the Arabs. We reached agreement with the
                    Russians. After that we tried to cut them out of the negotiation as much as
                    possible. However, at this time we needed their help in arranging a cease-fire.
                    We were clear that there should be a cease-fire. So the problem was to get a
                    message to Israel to stop advancing and trying to wipe out the Egyptian Army.
                    Timing was crucial because in a couple of days this could be a fait
                    accompli.</p>
                <p>I recall a crucial cable that we were trying to send to our Embassy in Tel Aviv.
                    We had trouble getting this cable out, from the mechanical point of view. It was
                    absolutely crucial to get a message to Prime Minister Golda Meir right away.
                    Kissinger, Saunders, Sisco, and Atherton drafted this cable. Kissinger told
                    Eagleburger, who was his Executive Assistant, to get the cable out. Kissinger
                    was going to go to bed. We suspected the Russians of holding up the cable, but,
                    in fact, the Russians had no incentive to block this message because they also
                    wanted a cease-fire. We didn't know what had gone wrong. We just couldn't get
                    the damned cable out! Several hours passed, and every hour counted. Kissinger
                    was asleep.</p>
                <p>There were about ten of us in the room, still trying to get the damned cable out.
                    We knew that when Kissinger found out that this cable had not gone out while he
                    was sleeping, he was going to erupt like Mount Vesuvius. We knew what was
                    coming. It was just as if a train were coming straight at us. Kissinger wasn't
                    going to listen to excuses. Everybody in that room left Eagleburger alone,
                    except myself. I purposely stayed, knowing what was going to happen. I said to
                    myself that Eagleburger needed some moral support. Everyone else chickened out.
                    There was a mass exodus of the American staff. They all just sneaked away. This
                    seemed to be a tremendous crisis. Kissinger was going to go ballistic when he
                    found out that the cable had not gone out which, of course, is what he did. To
                    this day Eagleburger has always considered me an heroic figure for standing by
                    him at this awful moment.</p>
                <p>It was frustrating. It was serious. We finally had to take the cable out to the
                    US Air Force plane which we were using, and which had its own communications
                    equipment. We finally got the cable sent from the plane. To this day we don't
                    know what happened. We might suspect the Russians but, in this case, we couldn't
                    see why they would want to stop the cable. I still don't know what happened.</p>
                <p>As always with Kissinger we had our laughs during the hectic travels. Once, as we
                    were flying into a Middle Eastern capital, the Xerox machine on the plane broke
                    loose and headed for the incredibly energetic Sisco. I yelled out: “Catch that
                    machine - we cannot stand to have copies made of Sisco!”</p>
                <pb facs="0401" n="Page0401"/>
                <p>I was with Kissinger on other trips to Europe. I was with him on trips to Mexico
                    that were important. Then, of course, I was with him on trips to southern
                    Africa, when we went to several places. We also went to West and East Africa.
                    There was a major speech which Kissinger delivered in Lusaka [Zimbabwe], which
                    announced our change in position in negotiations with Ian Smith in Southern
                    Rhodesia. We also went to South Africa to make sure that a deal could be struck
                    on this matter. And we went to “front line” states for their support. I was on
                    all those trips; two major Africa trips were in April and September 1976. There
                    were others I'm leaving out, such as a successful one to India where Kissinger
                    repaired relations which had been severely strained over our Pakistan tilt
                    during the Bangladeshi crisis. Kissinger recognized India's preeminence in the
                    region. I helped to draft a nationwide radio address that reached several
                    hundred million people. It was a successful visit. I also went with Kissinger to
                    Pakistan, Morocco, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, many Arab nations, and others I
                    can't recall. Another major trip ended in Rome where Kissinger made a major
                    speech on world agriculture. This too involved the agonizing process of
                    coordinating with Washington agencies and continually redrafting the speech
                    while traveling.</p>
                <p>Of course, I also went on President Ford's trip to China in Decembe1975. We later
                    went on to Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
                <p>One major, and successful, focus of Kissinger's attention which I cannot
                    reconstruct in detail was southern Africa. After the Lusaka speech shifting US
                    policy towards black aspirations, Kissinger engaged in very intense diplomacy to
                    bring independence and majority rule to Rhodesia, later Zimbabwe. This involved
                    a couple of trips to Africa and tough negotiations with Ian Smith and South
                    African leaders. There were also visits to front-line African states to line up
                    their support. Undersecretary Chuck Robinson devised economic plans for
                    Kissinger to bolster diplomatic efforts. We went to London and coordinated
                    closely with the British. Kissinger also consulted at home on these issues with
                    black American leaders. I was in all of the negotiations and trips, and it was
                    very dramatic. There were other stops in east and west Africa. And Kissinger
                    paid considerable attention to Angola, the Cuban and Soviet angles, as well as
                    the Chinese involvement.</p>
                <p>It is not often recalled that Kissinger was the catalyst for Rhodesian
                    independence as well as more American emphasis for black aspirations, generally.
                    It all started with the Lusaka speech which was one of Kissinger's most
                    important ever.</p>
                <p>A few more comments about Africa on which Kissinger (and I) spent a great deal of
                    time and effort. Generally people, including critics of Kissinger, overlook this
                    - including his significant achievements.</p>
                <pb facs="0402" n="Page0402"/>
                <p>The catalyst was an historic speech in Lusaka - which made the President of
                    Zambia, Kenneth Kaunda, cry. As Kissinger was gearing up for an African trip,
                    the African bureau wished to steer him and the Administration into a much more
                    forceful backing for black Africans' aspirations for justice and equality - out
                    of principle and to elevate our standing on the continent. I shared these goals
                    but worked closely with the bureau to feature the geopolitical advantages of
                    this approach. An emphasis on humanitarian elements alone was not apt to sway
                    Kissinger. So we also stressed that aligning ourselves with African aspirations
                    would greatly help us in our geopolitical confrontation with Moscow on the
                    continent. The bureau and I sent joint memos to Kissinger on the trip. Kissinger
                    agreed and we went through the usual agonizing process of writing a major
                    speech. In this speech Kissinger strongly backed racial justice as well as
                    addressed other issues. It had a major impact.</p>
                <p>There were several African trips, for this and other goals. I recall the very
                    moving poet- leader Senghor of Senegal, who impressed Kissinger - they had a
                    very interesting philosophical exchange. We were all deeply stirred by the sight
                    of the ancient prisons in West Africa, the Ivory Coast, I believe, where the
                    slave shipments began. And Kissinger made another major speech - again the usual
                    agony of extracting ideas and projects from the bureaucracy and going through
                    multiple drafts - on Third World development at an UNCTAD conference in
                    Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania.</p>
                <p>Kissinger made several trips to “fontline” states like Kenya and Tanzania when he
                    began pressing for Rhodesian independence - i.e., become Zimbabwe. On that and
                    subsequent trips there was intensive diplomacy with South Africa (Vorster),
                    Rhodesia (Ian Smith), the British, and the neighboring states. It was a
                    whirlwind, herculean effort that my dim memory - and so far, historians - is not
                    doing justice. There were the usual mixes of Kissinger sticks and carrots and
                    rationales to various leaders. Chuck Robinson, Under Secretary for Economic
                    Affairs, headed up an ambitious effort for economic development in the area as a
                    sweetener.</p>
                <p>As a result the die was cast for Rhodesia to become Zimbabwe and this was one of
                    Kissinger's major diplomatic achievements, and least heralded, in my view.
                    People should consult his memoirs for a much fuller account.</p>
                <p>There were some interesting leaders we met. The racist South Africans and
                    Rhodesians. The intellectual (but disastrously socialistic) Nyerere of Tanzania
                    calmly dignified and impressive in his modest home. The flamboyant Kenyatta of
                    Kenya, where I believe Kissinger briefly joined in an African dance. The
                    emotional Kaunda of Zambia. And others. The corrupt thug, Mobutu of Zaire.</p>
                <pb facs="0403" n="Page0403"/>
                <p>Let's see. I've already gone over the Middle East. I can't really add anything to
                    what I've already described. We're covering relations with China in other
                    interviews. We covered Vietnam elsewhere. Basically, the Vietnam Agreement was
                    undermined, as was the agreement on Cambodia in 1975, which collapsed. This was
                    a very painful period. We got our Embassy people out of Saigon and Phnom Penh
                    but did not get all of the Vietnamese and Cambodian people out whom we had hoped
                    to evacuate. The basic question was whom you leave behind and whom you get out.
                    Kissinger was outraged over the lack of Congressional support for our allies and
                    economic and military aid for South Vietnam. A poignant example was the leader
                    of Cambodia saying that they were staying behind and that we had let them down.
                    They were subsequently killed.</p>
                <p>The whole relationship with the Russians was running out of steam. However, one
                    thing that became significant, although we didn't realize it at the time, was
                    the application of the Helsinki Accords. There were three parts or baskets in
                    the Helsinki Accords. One involved security and borders, one involved economic
                    affairs, and one involved human rights. Kissinger, consistent with his general
                    position, didn't quite see the significance of the human rights basket, at least
                    as far as I recall. He may regard this differently now. History has shown that
                    was very crucial, because it gave the people of Eastern Europe and the Soviet
                    Union something to point to. It gave an opening for international attention. It
                    had a subversive effect on the Soviet system and its control of Eastern
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>Q: You know, some years ago I interviewed George Vest, who was working on the
                    Helsinki Accords. He said that he felt undercut by Kissinger because he would
                    hear from people like the Swedes- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>Anyhow, Vest said that he would hear from the Swedes about the settlement of arms
                    control issues, borders, and all of that. I was wondering whether you were
                    getting any feel for this within your own organization.</p>
                <p>LORD: I recall Kissinger's skepticism on the third basket or human rights
                    affairs. George Vest, by the way, was an outstanding officer. He was Public
                    Affairs Officer for Kissinger for a while. I would certainly not contradict
                    anything that he said that sounds plausible to me. It is clear that, at the
                    time, Kissinger wasn't that much interested in the third basket of the Helsinki
                    Accords. I think that Kissinger now recognizes that it was very important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the third basket or the human rights question play
                        much of role in policy planning?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0404" n="Page0404"/>
                <p>LORD: I had Sandy Vogelgesang following the issue of human rights all the time.
                    It was rather difficult for her. She was also working on Europe and on some
                    economic issues. We tried to introduce this matter at various times, but I don't
                    want to exaggerate our impact. In Kissinger's case it wasn't a major element. We
                    would introduce it. I don't recall whether we were pressing third basket issues
                    in the view that it could help our security because it was going to undermine
                    Soviet ideological and other positions; it would help us in security terms, not
                    just values and feel good issues. I know that we not only agreed but made sure
                    that the human rights dimension was included in southern African diplomacy. This
                    included the payoff domestically, as well as justice in Africa. I might say that
                    Kissinger deserves more credit on Africa than he generally got. He spent a great
                    deal of time and energy on this. As we went ahead on African diplomacy generally
                    and specifically on these southern African issues, Kissinger met a couple of
                    times witAmerican black leaders and tried to stay in touch with them. I think
                    that they always remained somewhat suspicious of him, but he tried to reach out
                    and work with them. I don't recall specifically whether we were smart enough to
                    point out the importance of the third basket.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it surprised everybody.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Even human rights advocates didn't realize that it was going to be this
                    effective, although in principle they were very much in favor of emphasizing
                    this issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the United Nations? What was Kissinger's view of
                        thUnited Nations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: It was sort of middle of the road. He was certainly not anti-UN like some
                    other conservatives are today and have been throughout history. He is nothing
                    like Senator Jesse Helms [Republican, North Carolina]. However, Kissinger also
                    understood that we often would have to act without the UN. American leadership
                    was crucial, and we couldn't rely on the UN. There was a lot of hypocrisy up
                    there at the UN in New York.</p>
                <p>He paid a lot of attention to his annual and special speeches to the UN. There
                    were a lot of specific initiatives which Ambassador Patrick Moynihan [American
                    Permanent Representative to the UN at the time] delivered on Kissinger's behalf
                    in September, 1975. So, on some of the developing issues, that is, Third World
                    and economic issues, he thought that the UN could be of some significance.
                    Certainly, we had to work with the UN to some extent on the Law of the Sea.
                    However, there is no question that the UN was not a major factor in Kissinger's
                    approach. He was not antagonistic to the organization. He was just skeptical
                    about how much could be accomplished by working through it. We had much more
                    clout at the UN at the time than we have today. With respect to Ambassador
                    Moynihan, and I forget who else was in our UN Mission when Moynihan was
                    there...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it Yost?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. Kissinger was impatient with the anti-American rhetoric that you often
                    found at the UN. He was concerned about the North-South divide and how these
                    issues were addressed ideologically, rather than in pragmatic terms, with
                    rhetorical battles between northern and southern countries. Kissinger was
                    somewhat contemptuous of so-called neutral countries. I forget what these
                    countries called their bloc then, the non-aligned bloc or whatever it was. They
                    often sided with the Russians. Kissinger had some suspicions of the UN, although
                    on some issues he tried to use it as a platform. He always went up to New York
                    every fall, of course, for the general debate in the General Assembly and gave
                    thoughtful speeches. He tried to point out where the UN needed reform, but also
                    where it could be helpful to American interests.</p>
                <p>I think that Kissinger also recognized that UN members had been playing, and
                    continued to play, a contructive role as peacekeepers in selective areas,
                    whether it was Cyprus, the Sinai Peninsula, or elsewhere. So he looked at the UN
                    as an adjunct of policy, not a central element of it. He was skeptical about the
                    UN, and clearly did not look at it as a major platform, as far as he was
                    concerned.</p>
                <p>Q: Regarding his speeches, would he say to his speechwriters that this or that is
                    the theme that he wanted to emphasize? How did this work out?</p>
                <p>LORD: His themes would emerge in his conversations with us. Generally, he would
                    kick the conversation off with the little circle of people that I have
                    mentioned. He would say that he wanted to give a speech in this place at this
                    time. He would indicate that these are what some of the themes should be. He
                    would welcome others giving ideas, and he often would use them. He would usually
                    have a pretty clear idea in his mind of what he wanted to accomplish. Sometimes
                    he would express himself in more general terms. He might start out by saying
                    that he wanted to indicate that the U.S. is taking the developing countries more
                    seriously. We don't have that reputation at this time. He would say that he
                    didn't want just general rhetoric but rather some specific proposals that would
                    help the economic situation of the developing countries. He realized this might
                    annoy our Treasury, AID [Agency for International Development], and Commerce
                    Departments somewhat, but he asked us to do this if necessary. He might ask us
                    to give him some ideas and he might have some specific suggestions. He might say
                    that he wanted to make clear that we were going to follow this or that policy
                    with this or that country, this or that issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0406" n="Page0406"/>
                <p>At the beginning of the drafting of a speech, Kissinger would indicate in varying
                    levels of detail what he wanted to accomplish. He would welcome ideas and would
                    have more ideas as he went along. He would reject some and adopt others.
                    However, he always insisted not only on the substance of the speech being as
                    interesting as possible but on its having a well-developed structure. He didn't
                    want the speech to be just a grab bag of ideas. Generally, you could look at the
                    speech he delivered, much as an English major, and appreciate how it was put
                    together, as it were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In looking ahead, did you identify any places which you
                        thoughmight be boils which might burst?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Part of our role in Policy Planning was to try to do that. That is, to say
                    what might go sour or where we were on the wrong track. This was, in part, the
                    devil's advocacy role which I mentioned before. We did this first in talking to
                    officers from the various bureaus and then with Kissinger, either alone with him
                    or with others, as necessary.</p>
                <p>A good case in point is Iran, where we strongly supported the Shah. Frankly, I
                    don't recall personally challenging that position. It is possible that some of
                    my staff did. It's easy, in retrospect, to second guess this position. The fact
                    is that the Shah did some good things, early in his career, including the
                    advancement of women...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the white revolution.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: And he promoted some economic development. However, he became over
                    ambitious in his plans, and, of course, there were some cases of clear
                    mistreatment of his people as well. That cost him support. I don't recall
                    whether any of us challenged the policy line on Iran as a regional power, as
                    well as the shortcomings of that approach. I was on the trip to Iran and was
                    part of the Shah's summit meeting with President Nixon.One thing that I did
                    personally was to forward dissenting views. I was selective because Kissinger
                    certainly didn't want 100 different views coming from the Policy Planning Staff.
                    But for the sake of policy planning, if someone on my staff had a different view
                    than I did, and I thought that it was well considered, I would forward that view
                    to Kissinger. In effect, I would say to him that on this or that issue my view
                    is that you should proceed as follows. However, I want you to know that some
                    members of my staff feel that were should do something else. Here are my
                    arguments and here are their arguments.</p>
                <p>I didn't overdo this. I would discuss the issue among my staff and try to develop
                    a consensus. Obviously, I was in charge and was the boss. However, I felt, and
                    particularly in the case of policy planning, that it was wise to have different
                    points of view expressed. And certainly it was good for staff morale.</p>
                <pb facs="0407" n="Page0407"/>
                <p>I might even attach such a differing view to a memorandum to Kissinger. I might
                    say: “Attached is a view of so and so on my staff on this issue. I disagree with
                    it for the following reasons, but I think that a fair case can be made and has
                    effectively been made. I think that you ought to see it.” It is possible that
                    might have happened on issues like policy toward Iran, but I just don't
                    recall.</p>
                <p>I must say, I am proud of the performance of my Policy Planning Staff, which
                    Kissinger recognized with the collective Distinguished Honor Award. At the end,
                    we compiled a complete record of all the significant papers and memos for the
                    historical files. This will give a full record of all our work. I'm really not
                    doing justice here to the hundreds of papers (we averaged at least one per day)
                    that we forwarded to the Secretary and others on all the major issues.</p>
                <p>Just a few that I recall include a major strategy paper toward the developing
                    world, several non-proliferation papers, several others on energy, Latin
                    America, etc. Major substantive departures would also occur in speeches - like
                    the UN speech in 1975, the UNCTAD speech in Tanzania in 1976, the Lusaka speech
                    in 1975, a Mexico speech in 1975, and a couple of Law of the Sea speeches - on
                    that complex issue we did a great deal. On all this S/P worked closely with
                    other bureaus and agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Dissent Channel? Was that in place during
                        your timon the Policy Planning Staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Thanks for reminding me. Absolutely. There was a DissenChannel, and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what the Dissent Channel was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: The Dissent Channel provided an opportunity for Foreign Service Officers,
                    either serving abroad or in the Department in Washington to register their
                    concern about a given policy. This meant that their supervisor didn't want to
                    forward this expression of opinion in a cable from an Embassy or a State office
                    because the boss didn't agree with this viewpoint. But a more junior officer who
                    felt strongly about a given issue had the right to bring his or her view to the
                    top. I'm not talking about personnel or grievance matters now. These concerned
                    substantive issues. A junior officer could prepare a cable saying that he
                    disagreed with established policy for the following reasons. This was a tricky
                    matter, of course, because a lot of bosses wouldn't take kindly to this
                    procedure. However, it was understood that people had the right to do this and
                    that they shouldn't be punished for it. Some supervisors were more enlightened
                    about this procedure than others.</p>
                <pb facs="0408" n="Page0408"/>
                <p>In my case, as I've just described, we didn't need a Dissent Channel on my staff
                    because I really felt that if people felt strongly about a given issue and their
                    viewpoint was well reasoned, I would forward their views. I would certainly go
                    to Kissinger if I thought that such a view was important. This procedure was
                    good for morale, and there was no need for a formalized dissent procedure on my
                    staff.</p>
                <p>When I joined the Policy Planning Staff, the Dissent Channel was located
                    somewhere else. I don't recall where it was. With Kissinger's agreement, I
                    purposely had this channel located in my office to provide it with operational
                    support. We would be the people who would forward a Dissent message to the
                    Secretary of State and regularly advertised in the Department and overseas that
                    State Department staff members had the right to make use of this procedure. So
                    this was done. I don't recall any details on it, such as how many cases of
                    dissent were selected to be brought to the Secretary's attention. Sometimes, it
                    was just a matter of referring the matter to the attention of an Assistant
                    Secretary. As I recall it, Kissinger was never very enthusiastic about this
                    procedure. We forwarded dissent messages and encouraged the process, but I don't
                    think that there was a major series of memoranda on this matter. I don't know
                    what has happened with this channel more recently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's still there. I wanted to ask about this, and then we
                        mighbreak for lunch.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I would also like to mention that we made sure that there was a full-time
                    job to head up the Open Forum in Washington. Previously it was a part-time job.
                    I arranged that this was handled by someone who would take a year off from a
                    regular Foreign Service Officer job and head this up. We would have meetings
                    with people who held dissenting views to air their opinions. I tried to
                    encourage this procedure as a way of stimulating greater debate within the
                    Department of State. However, this was never something which Secretary Kissinger
                    was enthusiastic about.</p>
                <p>I made sure that the person heading the Open Forum program did so aa full time
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that this person also headed the Dissent
                        channel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: You're right. I often spoke at the Open Forum meetings at which people
                    could vent their views and sometimes differences within the Department. At times
                    we had interesting speakers come in, including some who were controversial, like
                    the head of the Green Party in Germany, Petra Kelly. That was another
                    process.</p>
                <p>We paid quite a bit of attention to this. I thought that it was important
                    intellectually, but also for the morale of the Foreign Service, that people
                    would think that this kind of thing could go on.</p>
                <pb facs="0409" n="Page0409"/>
                <p>One last thing I would like to mention before I forget it. That is, the fact that
                    Kissinger came close to resigning. I'm not sure that I have the chronology right
                    on this, but it began toward the end of 1975, shortly after a trip which he made
                    to China during the Ford administration. I think that it was in October, 1975.
                    Secretary Kissinger was setting up President Ford's trip to China in December,
                    1975. There was a mini-massacre, not on the scale of the Saturday night massacre
                    during the Nixon administration, when Attorney General Richardson resigned. This
                    was another sort of massacre, involving bureaucratic changes.</p>
                <p>As I describe elsewhere, by the way, Kissinger's trip to China had not gone well,
                    and the Ford trip to China two months later ended up being very frosty, although
                    we maintained a polite veneer over it. I don't have all of the details at my
                    fingertips, but shortly after we returned to Washington from this trip to China,
                    Kissinger lost his NSC [National Security Council] hat and was replaced as
                    National Security Adviser by Brent Scowcroft. Also, I think that James
                    Schlesinger [then Secretary of Defense] was fired and Donald Rumsfeld (then
                    Chief-of-Staff) went over to replace him as Secretary of Defense. I believe that
                    at about this point George Bush was brought back from China to head the CIA
                    [Central Intelligence Agency].</p>
                <p>Essentially because he lost his NSC hat, Kissinger was upset, although this
                    change made sense. It worked out well, and Scowcroft turned out to be a close
                    collaborator with Kissinger, having the same world view as Kissinger. Kissinger
                    gradually began to realize that this new arrangement could work out well.</p>
                <p>However, at the time, both in terms of losing some control, but also because
                    there was a perception abroad that Kissinger's role had been weakened, he was
                    concerned about the implications. We went through several weeks when Kissinger
                    was genuinely debating in his own mind whether he should resign as Secretary of
                    State. This seems absurd in retrospect. Given Kissinger's prestige, wearing two
                    hats made no sense and was no way to run the show. It was an unnecessary
                    distraction and bureaucratically awkward. Brent Scowcroft had worked closely
                    with Kissinger, and it would have been absurd for Kissinger to leave the
                    Department of State. For several weeks Kissinger met periodically with me, Larry
                    Eagleburger, and some other, close advisers, as well as friends such as Bill
                    Simon, who was either Secretary of the Treasury or had held that position. Also
                    in the meetings with Kissinger, I believe, was David Bruce and a couple of other
                    people. At these meetings Kissinger was wrestling over the question of whether
                    he should resign. We met both at the Department and in private homes.</p>
                <pb facs="0410" n="Page0410"/>
                <p>It reached the point, by the end of 1975, either in November or December, that
                    Eagleburger and I drafted about ten versions of a public explanation of why
                    Kissinger was resigning as Secretary of State. We did somersaults, trying to
                    figure out how to write this letter. The more we tried to do it, the less it
                    seemed to make sense. It was a very serious matter, and Kissinger genuinely was
                    thinking of resigning. I still remember that it was on a Saturday or a Sunday
                    that I had met with Kissinger again on the latest draft. I waved goodbye to him
                    as he left the Department in a car to go over from the Department of State to
                    the White House, to discuss his possible resignation with the White House. We
                    thought that this actually might happen.</p>
                <p>I forget actually whether Kissinger brought this matter up seriously with
                    President Ford or whether President Ford asked him to forget about it. I don't
                    know whether Kissinger said that he would actually resign. Of course, in moments
                    of heat before, he would often threaten resignation for purposes of enhancing
                    his leverage. These episodes were mostly not serious, but this time his
                    resignation seemed to be a serious possibility. There was a lot of debate among
                    his advisers as to whether he should resign, but most people felt that he was
                    exaggerating the blow of losing his NSC hat.</p>
                <p>Then, I guess, we got to the point where it was just about Christmas holidays,
                    1975. Kissinger finally decided to cool off on the matter over the holidays,
                    noting the fact that we were having trouble drafting this letter of resignation.
                    He said that this meant that we were having trouble finding a real rationale why
                    he should leave the Department. He asked us to think about this matter over the
                    Christmas holidays.</p>
                <p>So the process of considering his resignation stopped because of the Christmas
                    holidays, and the whole episode just faded away. He never did anything about
                    this. I don't know how much of that is public knowledge. I haven't read
                    Kissinger's most recent volume of memoirs yet. This was a strange episode, where
                    a few of Kissinger's closest advisers were trying to figure out what the impact
                    of his resignation would have on our foreign policy. He finally decided that it
                    was in the national interest not to resign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, it was not in the national interest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Clearly it was not in the national interest. People always felt that if
                    Kissinger threatened to resign, it was strictly a ploy. He often did threaten to
                    resign, but in this case he was genuinely considering going through with it.
                    Fortunately, he stayed and was dominant on policy until the end. Under pressure
                    from the Reagan challenge, however, Ford and his staff began to put some
                    daylight between the President and Kissinger.XV. STATE DEPARTMENT POLICY
                    PLANNING STAFF - CHINA (1973-1977)</p>
                <pb facs="0411" n="Page0411"/>
                <p>Q: Just to put this in context, we're going to follow the China thread through
                    the period when you were the Director of the Policy Planning Staff in the
                    Department of State, from 1973 to 1977. Then we'll pick it up with your service
                    as Ambassador to China and the period of the Clinton administration. Here, we'll
                    just stick to the China thread. Did the Policy Planning function include a China
                    role?</p>
                <p>LORD: I was Director of Policy Planning, of course, but I handled the China role
                    personally. I worked very closely with the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific
                    Affairs [EAP], first with Phil Habib, and then with Art Hummel and Bill
                    Gleysteen as Assistant and Deputy Assistant Secretaries, in addition to people
                    on the China desk like Al Jenkins and in INR [Bureau of Intelligence Research].
                    Also, I dealt with the White House, the NSC, Dick Solomon, and Peter Rodman. So
                    this was a collective effort. As I say elsewhere, Kissinger melded together a
                    team, drawing on the best Foreign Service Officers he promoted, who took over
                    most of the Assistant Secretary positions, as well as people he brought over
                    from the White House, including myself, Hal Sonnenfeldt, Bill Hyland, and Larry
                    Eagleburger. So, contrary to Kissinger's general reputation of allegedly
                    mistreating the Foreign Service and the State Department while he was in the
                    White House, once Kissinger became Secretary of State, he realized the
                    importance of using the Foreign Service. He always paid tribute to the
                    dedication and intelligence of Foreign Service people. There wasn't just a
                    palace guard around him. He really used the best people. He often did not treat
                    Ambassadors with total openness, to say the least, depending on their
                    competence. I'll cover the whole issue of Kissinger's style elsewhere.</p>
                <p>The manner in which he handled the China matter reflects what he did on other
                    issues. For example, he would work with Art Hartman [Assistant Secretary in the
                    Bureau of European Affairs] on Europe and Russia, but he would have Helmut
                    Sonnenfeldt [Counselor of the State Department] and Bill Hyland [INR Director]
                    work on these issues as well. On Middle Eastern questions, he would work with
                    Hal Saunders, who had come over from the White House staff, but also worked
                    closely with Roy Atherton [Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Near Eastern
                    Affairs] and Joe Sisco (Undersecretary). It was always a melding of Foreign
                    Service Officers and people close to Kissinger who had worked with him in the
                    White House. Many of these people, like myself, had once been Foreign Service
                    Officers.</p>
                <p>That's the way things worked on China policy matters. I was still the key person,
                    but clearly relied heavily on EAP [Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs] and
                    on the White House staff, because I had these other responsibilities. So that's
                    the way policy matters were managed there.</p>
                <p>I made 9 trips to China when I was in the government during this period. We had,
                    of course, the secret Kissinger trip to China in July 1971; the trip in October
                    [1971]; and the Nixon trip [in February 1972], which makes three. Then the trip
                    in June 1972, which makes four. The trip in February 1973, makes five.</p>
                <pb facs="0412" n="Page0412"/>
                <p>I left the government service in May 1973. I was exhausted physically, mentally,
                    and emotionally. Working for Kissinger for four years is enough to drain
                    anybody. It was a tremendous experience but it was also tiring. I wanted to
                    recharge my batteries, see more of my family, and so on.</p>
                <p>There was supposed to be a trip to China by Kissinger during that period, partly
                    to resolve the Cambodian question. Partly because of the Cambodian bombing halt
                    and the derailing of those negotiations and for other reasons, that trip was
                    postponed. So I didn't miss any of the Kissinger trips to China, even though I
                    was out of government service between May and September 1973.</p>
                <p>The next trip to China, which was the sixth such trip for me and Kissinger was in
                    November 1973. There were two more Kissinger-only trips in 1974 and 1975, and
                    President Ford's visit in December 1975 (as well as to Indonesia and the
                    Philippines).</p>
                <p>Q: I think that we probably should record when you were made Director of the
                    Policy Planning Office in the State Department. Did you wear, in effect, a China
                    hat, as well as a Policy Planning hat?</p>
                <p>LORD: That's right. This has been done on several occasions. My successor as
                    Director of Policy Planning was Tony Lake. He wore an Africa hat, in addition to
                    a Policy Planning hat. I'll treat the policy planning function in another
                    session. Basically, one of the key ways to be effective in this function is to
                    have access to the Secretary of State. One way to do that is to be a key adviser
                    to the Secretary on one or two issues. You then have that natural and constant
                    entree to the Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time, in late 1973, were all operating systems go?
                        Werthings looking good?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Do you mean with China?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With China, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, conditions were improving. As I said earlier, President Nixon was
                    reelected by a landslide [in November 1972], and this was still before the
                    Watergate Affair really became a central preoccupation of the administration.
                    The Watergate Affair really began to emerge more and more strongly in late 1973
                    and 1974. I cover this in connection with the trips to China and other places.
                    Obviously, the Watergate Affair began to affect our foreign policy generally and
                    increasingly became a focus of President Nixon's attention.</p>
                <pb facs="0413" n="Page0413"/>
                <p>Still, during the fall of 1973 the ultimate impact of the Watergate Affair was
                    far from apparent, and certainly would have been far from apparent to the
                    Chinese. The Watergate Affair was gathering some steam, but it didn't seem to
                    have done so in any decisive fashion by November 1973, as I recall.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the Vietnam War irritant between us and the Chinese appeared to be
                    behind us, and President Nixon was presumably in office for four more years. The
                    Soviet problem was still there, although we'd improved relations with the
                    Soviets, which was a good development in terms of our relations with China. We'd
                    improved relations with one country and presumably could improve relations with
                    the other country, because this gave us more leverage.</p>
                <p>On the whole, yes, the situation was improving. We had more and more
                    communications with the Chinese through the two channels I mentioned, the
                    Chinese Embassy in Paris and the Chinese Mission to the UN in New York, and now
                    had Liason Offices in the two capitals. We had worked in parallel on issues like
                    the situation in South Asia, and we kept the Chinese informed on other issues,
                    especially our dealings with Moscow. We were overcoming historical mistrust and
                    isolation between ourselves and China. We were beginning to pick up some
                    momentum in the Chinese-American relationship. We were working on the claims and
                    assets question and on the economic front. We were sharing our intelligence with
                    the Chinese. Generally, things were going quite well. That was the background to
                    the Kissinger trip of November 1973. As I have already said, the February 1973
                    setting up of Liason Offices was the single best visit to China.</p>
                <p>The November 1973 trip took place at the end of a long swing through the Middle
                    East. The Yom Kippur War [between Israel, on the one hand, and Egypt and Syria,
                    on the other] had broken out in October 1973, just after I returned to
                    government and Kissinger had been appointed Secretary of State. So we went to
                    Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan, Egypt, Iran, Pakistan. We stayed at the same Guest
                    House in Pakistan from which we sneaked out to China on the secret trip in July
                    1971. On this occasion, and for the first time, my wife went back to China. I
                    met her there. She had gone to China ahead of me. She saw a number of her
                    relatives. Indeed, this return to China led, many years later, to her
                    best-selling novel, “Spring Moon.”</p>
                <p>Kissinger received a very warm welcome on this trip to China. He again had very
                    good and wide ranging discussions with Zhou Enlai. Of all of the discussions I
                    have been involved in during my entire career, the Zhou Enlai-Kissinger
                    discussions were the most sophisticated, wide ranging, and interesting, bar
                    none. Kissinger himself has said that Zhou was the number one statesman that he
                    ever met. De Gaulle tied for first place in this respect, but Kissinger only saw
                    De Gaulle a few times. I would also put Zhou Enlai in first place.</p>
                <pb facs="0414" n="Page0414"/>
                <p>Having said that, as I commented to Kissinger, and I think that he agreed and so
                    stated in his later memoirs Zhou Enlai seemed somewhat more subdued and
                    restrained than usual. Kissinger was used to Zhou Enlai as a very charismatic
                    and very elegant figure who often commented on various issues somewhat at
                    length, by contrast with Mao. Zhou Enlai had an elegant mandarin style. I don't
                    want to overstate this, but Zhou probably knew by now that he had cancer, which
                    may have begun to have an impact on his stamina. Maybe Zhou and Mao had begun by
                    now to see the creeping impact of the Watergate Affair, but that's pure
                    speculation, as I've already said. I don't think that it was a major
                    consideration as yet. Zhou Enlai's comments were less lengthy, and he seemed a
                    little bit restrained, although he was still brilliant.</p>
                <p>Although this was a good trip to China, and the mood remained friendly on the
                    whole, I would say that you can't expect always to develop momentum during any
                    particular trip. Compared to the trip to China in February 1973, we didn't make
                    as much progress. So it's possible, although we didn't know it at the time, that
                    the struggle that would emerge, certainly during the next couple of years in
                    China, over the succession to Mao, and the Watergate impact on our own domestic
                    scene, meant that we were beginning to see the first signs that domestic
                    constraints on each side were beginning to slow things down. I don't want to
                    stress this too much. I think that this became much clearer in 1974 and 1975.
                    This had not yet happened, and certainly Kissinger had a very warm reception
                    during this trip. Again, Kissinger had an unprecedented, three-hour meeting with
                    Chairman Mao, who normally met only with heads of state. Mao had already done
                    Kissinger the honor of meeting with him in February 1973, probably the first
                    time that Mao met anybody at Kissinger's level, although I could be wrong about
                    that.</p>
                <p>As I say, Mao met with Kissinger for three hours and obviously enjoyed the
                    meeting. On several occasions during this meeting Kissinger stood up as if to
                    leave, but Mao extended the conversation. Mao was physically frail, as he had
                    been, but he was still very sharp in his comments. Once again, this meeting
                    hadn't been set up in advance. We assumed that we would meet with him, since we
                    had seen him before. Wang Hairong [Mao's grandniece] would shuffle in and out
                    with notes, and Zhou Enlai would announce that Mao wanted to see Kissinger.</p>
                <p>Q: One question. This will come up again, as things developed. As you describe
                    this meeting, obviously everyone was impressed by the meetings with Chairman
                    Mao, and all of that. However, I've just finished reading your wife's book,
                    “Eighth Moon,” about her sister. In this and other books about China, it really
                    comes across that Mao was in a class maybe a little ahead of Hitler and Stalin,
                    as far as what he did. In my opinion, Mao was one of the three monsters of the
                    20th century. Was this a factor in your contacts with Mao, or were we all caught
                    up in something like adulation of Mao?</p>
                <pb facs="0415" n="Page0415"/>
                <p>LORD: Well, it's a very fair and good question. Furthermore, I agree that Mao
                    should be put up there with Stalin and Hitler as a monster. Of course, the
                    official Chinese line is that Mao was “70 percent good and 30 percent bad.” They
                    say, and I think that you can reasonably make the case, if you try to be
                    detached about it, that when Mao was fighting to unify China and make it stand
                    up, his record was fairly positive, in Chinese terms. None of us liked
                    communism, of course. But then you had the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural
                    Revolution, the starvation of the people, the brutality, and so on. Even the
                    Chinese admit that Mao went overboard. In view of the tens of millions of people
                    who died, either through starvation or just in the prison camps and in other
                    ways, and the countless others who suffered, there is no question that Mao was a
                    monster.</p>
                <p>Now, to return to your question, we were certainly not na�ve. We knew that Mao
                    was no Boy Scout. That was true of Zhou Enlai, as well, who was, of course, more
                    elegant. So we knew for a fact that Mao and Zhou did not get to be where they
                    were without ruthlessness. Having said that, I admit that the personal impact of
                    Mao and Zhou put some restraint on our judgment in the 1970s. First of all, we
                    didn't know the full enormity of Mao's crimes at that point. Some people
                    probably knew or suspected it, but it was hard to know. I think that it's fair
                    to say that the full disasters of the Cultural Revolution, and even the famine
                    of the Great Leap Forward were not fully known in the 1970s. But Communist China
                    was clearly an unattractive society afflicted with the cult of the personality
                    and with repression. That was obvious to anybody, but the full enormity of it
                    was not known.</p>
                <p>Secondly, we were then on a very hard-headed mission. We were not going to give
                    the Chinese high marks for good behavior, but we tried to serve American
                    national interests. At the time we were concerned about the Soviets, the Vietnam
                    War, and all the other things we had to talk about. We also had the longer range
                    desire to engage with China as an emerging, great country. So that was uppermost
                    in our mind, rather than passing judgment on Chinese society.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, it was no secret, however, that Secretary Kissinger always had and
                    always will put the emphasis on geopolitics, as against human rights. Therefore,
                    without approving of or being naive about Mao's personality, Kissinger was
                    focused on American national interests and geopolitical considerations. In
                    fairness to Secretary Kissinger, he also believes that, over the long run, this
                    makes for a more stable and peaceful world, with less chance of people blowing
                    each other up. This also serves human rights in that sense.</p>
                <pb facs="0416" n="Page0416"/>
                <p>In addition, you had the general tendency of Americans to swing back and forth.
                    There was this euphoria of opening up relations with China. This made the media
                    and virtually everyone tend to downplay the ugly dimensions of contemporary
                    China. Today, the Chinese government often tends to get a very tough press in
                    the United States. And they deserve it. Yet, compared to the worst of the Mao
                    days, Chinese citizens have a better life. There is still great repression and
                    many abuses of human rights, but less serious compared to what they were going
                    through under Mao. However, for all of these reasons, I am basically granting
                    part of your point. No one thought that Mao was a nice person, but for all of
                    these other reasons, this consideration was not uppermost in our minds at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>One other point is that both Zhou Enlai and Mao were personally very impressive
                    in totally different ways. So it was a fact that when you enjoyed your
                    conversations with them, you tend to think in strategic terms as you are dealing
                    with them. The convergence of national interests also tends to affect one's
                    judgment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time, in late 1973, when you were seeing Mao, did
                        we seChina as being a decisive factor in the Vietnam War?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Do you mean in retrospect?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, the Vietnam War was officially over in January 1973,though the North
                    Vietnamese takeover was still to come.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess I mean in retrospect.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: We were still urging the Chinese, of course, to contact Hanoi and persuade
                    the North Vietnamese to live up to the Paris Agreements of 1973. The general
                    judgment was, both at the time we were negotiating the Paris Accords and then
                    trying to keep the agreement holding together, despite the North Vietnamese
                    violations, that the Chinese were more helpful than the Russians. This was
                    partly in their own self-interest. They didn't want the embarrassment of a
                    dispute with Hanoi to get in the way of their own national interest, at least on
                    the ideological plane. We also thought that they weren't going to bend over
                    backwards; they weren't going to do anything that would get them in trouble with
                    Hanoi, and that would lose them influence, compared to Russia's influence in
                    Hanoi.</p>
                <pb facs="0417" n="Page0417"/>
                <p>The same problem existed in Korea, because China was jockeying for position, with
                    Russia nearby. They were in a geopolitical competition with Hanoi. If China
                    leaned too hard on Hanoi, the North Vietnamese might turn more toward the
                    Russians. Not to mention, of course, that we now know much more than we did
                    then, believe it or not, about internal competition for leadership within China
                    as they headed the post-Mao period. Future leaders couldn't look too tough on
                    their 'allies'.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anybody telling you at that time that the Vietnamese
                        and thChinese really weren't blood brothers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: We knew earlier on that the Chinese put their relations with us first and
                    this alleged relationship of “lips and teeth” [a Chinese and North Vietnamese
                    propaganda term meaning different functions but close accommodation] with
                    Vietnam second. However, they wanted to have their cake and eat it, too, at
                    least as far as the competition with the Russians was concerned. I don't think
                    that we understood the full hostility in the relations between China and North
                    Vietnam. I don't recall anyone making this point very strongly. In retrospect,
                    this may show that we did not have enough sensitivity to history.</p>
                <p>Q: What about North Korea, because this must have been one of our concerns. It
                    was one of the few, really hostile land borders we had, outside of the border
                    with the Soviet Union. There was the division between North and South Korea and
                    a feeling that Kim Il-sung could launch an attack on South Korea at any time.
                    Was North Korea part of these discussions with China?</p>
                <p>LORD: It was, but as I recall the matter, it was not a very meaningful part. The
                    Chinese expressed a strict line of solidarity with the North Koreans. So we
                    really got nowhere on North Korea, as I recall.</p>
                <p>One area where we did make progress over time, and we're talking about a process
                    which covered several trips to China, concerned our alliance with Japan. During
                    the early talks with the Chinese, their basic line was that we were helping
                    Japan to rearm by our alliance with them and that we were making them dangerous.
                    We pointed out that this was an illogical position. Our alliance with Japan and
                    our troops stationed in Japan, plus our nuclear umbrella over Japan, meant that
                    Japan didn't really need to rearm or go nuclear. We said that it was in the
                    interests of China and of the East Asian region that Japan feel that its
                    security was taken care of by close ties with the U.S. Therefore, in effect, we
                    were restraining Japanese militarism, and the Chinese should favor that. In
                    fact, that argument had an impact on the Chinese over time, and they began to
                    accept that it was in their interest. They never came right out and said so,
                    either publicly or even privately, that they loved to see our troops in Japan or
                    loved our alliance with Japan. However, they clearly got the point and were much
                    more restrained, although that debate continues in Chinese minds, even as we
                    speak today. Japan was an interesting subject of discussion with the
                    Chinese.</p>
                <pb facs="0418" n="Page0418"/>
                <p>We also talked about the Middle East in these discussions. Kissinger kept the
                    Chinese informed in the course of his visits to China. The Chinese were clearly
                    pro-Arab and were not willing to do much with Israel. This situation changed
                    later on when the Chinese began to get military help from Israel. However, at
                    the time the Chinese took pretty much a pro-Arab, pro-Palestinian position. Of
                    course, we encouraged them to be more even handed. Basically, it was a matter of
                    briefing the Chinese on what we were up to, usually working in our prevention of
                    Soviet influence in the region.</p>
                <p>On these trips there was often discussion of Europe. China always wanted us to
                    have strong relations with Europe. They wanted to make sure that Russia had to
                    worry about its Western flanks and could not focus all of its energies on China
                    and East Asia. In some of these meetings with Zhou Enlai and Mao there was also
                    discussion regarding the Central Eurasian pivot area from Turkey around to
                    Pakistan. Of course, the Chinese had a particular friendship with Pakistan
                    vis-�-vis India. The Chinese were suspicious of India. Chinese friendship with
                    Pakistan was a frequent subject of dialogue between us. There were discussions
                    about that area, and its geopolitical significance. Occasionally, there were
                    conversations about Cuba and Africa, but these were not areas for major
                    discussions. There was a lot of talk about what the Russians were up to in these
                    areas as well as the Cuban role in Angola.</p>
                <p>On Taiwan the Chinese would press us, of course. We indicated that we weren't
                    going to do anything that would create great difficulties for China, but, of
                    course, we also were not prepared to normalize diplomatic relations with China
                    at that point or to back off from any of our commitments to Taiwan. That all
                    came later. These were some of the agenda items that we were dealing with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the subject of Albania ever come up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I'm sure we made some jokes. At one point, Albania was the one point in
                    Eastern Europe that was close to China. Albania said that, between them and the
                    Chinese, they represented one-quarter of the population of the world!</p>
                <p>During those several trips, however, almost everything came up, including history
                    and philosophy, in the course of regular agenda items, digressions, or jokes and
                    conversation. Finally there would be discussion on how to strengthen bilateral
                    ties. The Chinese maintained restraints so as to press us toward normalization.
                    We did establish and expand Liason Offices. Trade and cultural exchange were
                    limited. We moved on the claims and assets issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0419" n="Page0419"/>
                <p>As the Kissinger visits to China continued, we always took State Department
                    people with us. That was true even when Kissinger was National Security Council
                    Adviser and before he became Secretary of State. Generally, Kissinger would lean
                    on State Department people for support in discussing things like claims and
                    assets, as well as issues of trade and cultural exchanges. Kissinger saw these
                    matters as less than major in and of themselves, particularly compared with the
                    geopolitical dimensions of our relationship with China. However, he saw these
                    issues as valuable in signaling progress to the world and particularly in terms
                    of building up constituencies in both countries for improved relations. He felt
                    that, if we had business, cultural, and academic institutions in the U.S. which
                    were engaged with China, this would help to broaden domestic support for
                    American policy toward China. Similarly, within China, if more constituencies
                    were involved in developing good relations between the U.S. and China, this
                    would help to strengthen the overall fabric of the relationship, and help to
                    buffer it against strains. So, in this sense, Kissinger encouraged these
                    bilateral exchanges and contacts. However, for him these were relatively boring
                    matters, compared to the big, geopolitical issues. And the Chinese, because of
                    the Taiwan issue and our lack of diplomatic recognition, were not eager to allow
                    great expansion of ties that comes with normalization. And, of course, the trips
                    were all one way, our going to China, except for visits by Chinese officials to
                    the UN, which we would use for bilateral exchanges.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you talk a bit about how these meetings were conducted? Was this
                    strictly a matter of Kissinger sitting on one side of a table and Zhou En-lai
                    sitting on the other side? Did they talk back and forth or were there times when
                    other people would get up, and somebody more junior might say: “Look, we're
                    making a big thing of this, but remember that this is not as important to us as
                    it may seem.” Did people on either side try to put matters into perspective, or
                    was it a matter of the principals talking for the record?</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, I won't try to be precise in describing each individual trip.
                    Kissinger went back to China several times as Secretary of State after the Nixon
                    trip to China [in 1972]. He had people from the State Department with him. At
                    the meetings, in addition to me, always there would be John Holdridge (until he
                    became co-leader at the Liason Office with Al Jenkins) the Assistant Secretary
                    for East Asian Affairs and so on. After the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing was
                    opened, we had the chiefs of that office as part of the U.S. Delegation.</p>
                <p>I was in every meeting. The most central part of the visits would be with Zhou
                    Enlai until 1975, when Deng Xiaoping took the ill leader's place. Then, of
                    course, Kissinger met three times with Mao on his own, plus once with Nixon and
                    once with Ford. So he and I met a total of five times with Mao. I cannot be
                    precise in terms of chronology, but we also met several times with the Vice
                    Foreign Minister, Qiao Guanhua. Chao's wife was an interpreter. When Deng made a
                    comeback, Chao made a mistake when he put his chips on the Gang of Four. Qiao
                    Guanhua was a very sophisticated Vice Foreign Minister. He was a very able,
                    number two man in the Foreign Ministry. In a sense, he actually ran the Foreign
                    Ministry. The Foreign Minister was Ji Pengfei. He was replaced by Huang Hua
                    somewhat later on. Qiao Guanhua was the key man to work with, as was Zhang
                    Wenjin, the Assistant Minister who became Ambassador to the United States
                    somewhat later, and who accompanied Kissinger and me on our secret flight from
                    Pakistan to China. Let me here recall one issue that belongs with a previous
                    discussion of the February 1973 trip to China. On that trip we did raise again
                    the question of American prisoners being held in China. The Chinese released a
                    couple of prisoners who had been shot down over China as a result of the
                    February 1973 trip. One was a CIA officer named Downey, who had been held since
                    the Korean War. We raised his case. During the February 1973 trip, Zhou in
                    effect invited some humanitarian reason for them to release him, or perhaps we
                    thought of this angle. We looked into the matter. It turned out that Downey's
                    mother had become very sick, cancer I believe. So I believe that we sent a
                    message to Zhou, stating in effect: “Please release Downey so that he can see
                    his mother before she dies.” So Downey got out on humanitarian grounds because
                    his mother was sick.</p>
                <pb facs="0420" n="Page0420"/>
                <p>A couple of years later, lo and behold, Downey's mother was still alive and doing
                    well. So Peter Rodman and I drafted a memo from Kissinger to President Ford at
                    the time. The memo said along the following lines: “Mr. President, something has
                    come to our attention which is deeply disturbing. The Chinese may accuse us of
                    bad faith. We got Downey released a couple of years ago on humanitarian grounds
                    because his mother was believed to be about to die. But she is still alive and
                    doing well. The Chinese are obviously going to think that we misled them and
                    that this is an example of bad faith.” We then laid out several options as to
                    what we might do. One of these options was to have the CIA wipe out Mrs. Downey
                    so that we could show our good faith! It was, of course, a joke.</p>
                <p>Kissinger then sent this memo to President Ford. Ford called Kissinger to the
                    Oval Office and said seriously to him: “Henry, we can't do this.”</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Did you have a sense of how much the Chinese believed
                    their own people on what happened at these meetings? Did you find that the
                    officials lower down in the Chinese hierarchy were informed about these
                    meetings?</p>
                <p>LORD: Absolutely. The Chinese are very good at briefing up as well as briefing
                    down. Often we would meet with other, Chinese officials before we saw Zhou, or
                    we would be seeing their people ahead of time. We got the feeling that whatever
                    had been said found its way up the chain, and vice versa. The Chinese were very
                    good at orchestrating and singing from the same sheet of music.</p>
                <p>I also said that Mao would use brush strokes in his Socratic dialogue, employing
                    a few sentences and going from subject to subject. He was setting out the basic
                    instructions for Zhou to carry out more elaborately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds a little bit like Ronald Reagan, in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: True, but I wouldn't want to carry it too far.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Reagan would make a broad brush comment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: However, in Mao's case you have to be careful. Mao was very purposeful and
                    laid out his points very carefully, if briefly and seemingly casually. President
                    Reagan would be very economical in presenting his views, but I wouldn't put the
                    same, strategic purpose behind what he said as I would in the case of what Mao
                    said.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0421" n="Page0421"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time did Kissinger also make sure that everybody
                        on thU.S. side was well briefed, or was there still an element of
                        secrecy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Kissinger was much more open. By this time Kissinger was Secretary of State
                    and was using the State Department, as well as his colleagues on the NSC
                    [National Security Council], I think that Kissinger was fairly open. There might
                    have been an occasional, sensitive issue on which he talked to Zhou Enlai alone.
                    The fact that we were briefing the Chinese on Russian troop and other
                    deployments was closely held, even within our delegation. Jon Howe and I, and
                    sometimes Kissinger, I believe, handled these briefings. Not everyone would have
                    known about that. However, on the whole, in the various meetings, if there was
                    something that was really sensitive, which was not unusual for the Secretary of
                    State, he might just have me there. Or he might just talk about the matter to
                    Zhou Enlai in the course of a banquet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: But there would no longer...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: There would no longer be the kind of secrecy that we had before.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there concern, on our part, about Soviet troop deployments along the
                    Chinese border, or was this just something that we could say to the Chinese,
                    such as: “The Soviets are doing something there...”</p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, we had to strike a balance. We didn't want to look as if we were
                    deliberately trying to stoke their paranoia and fear and lose our credibility,
                    when the threat wasn't all that serious. We didn't want to make it look as if we
                    were trying to scare the Chinese for our own purposes. We weren't so stupid as
                    to exaggerate the Soviet threat to China. On the other hand, we did try to point
                    out that there was quite a formidable Soviet presence along the Chinese border,
                    which, of course, the Chinese knew, although probably not in the kind of detail
                    that we knew. We tried to strike a balance and gain Chinese confidence by
                    sharing this information. We reminded the Chinese that the Soviets were a
                    problem and, therefore, it was in the Chinese interest to continue to work with
                    us on this geopolitical balance. However, we did this without exaggerating the
                    Soviet threat or trying to pretend that it was more than it was. I think that,
                    in general, the feeling was that, although the tensions were lower, the
                    Sino-Russian relationship was still fairly hostile. However, there wasn't the
                    kind of border clashes that the Chinese had with the Russians in 1969.</p>
                <pb facs="0422" n="Page0422"/>
                <p>So I'll go to the details of the November 1973 trip, if that's agreeable. As I
                    said, after a long swing through the Middle East, I met up with my wife in China
                    [in 1973]. I felt that Zhou Enlai was more subdued. During the meeting with Mao,
                    I felt that he was more frail. Mao mentioned the Watergate Affair. He compared
                    it with breaking wind, and so forth. He could be a little crude. He made the
                    point that, in Chinese eyes, this was nothing. I think that that was true of the
                    views of most foreign countries, in Europe and everywhere else. However, it
                    showed that Mao noticed it.</p>
                <p>In the final, brief statement at the end of the meeting, I don't know whether you
                    could call it a communique, after some exchanges on Taiwan, Zhou Enlai did
                    insert the potentially meaningful phrase, the “Principle of One China.”</p>
                <p>We made it clear during this trip, and I haven't gone over the Kissinger memoirs,
                    that we couldn't accept the Japanese formula for the normalization of diplomatic
                    relations. The Japanese had leap frogged us after we surprised them in an
                    unfortunate way in 1972. Then they went ahead with their own process of
                    normalization of relations with China. They broke diplomatic ties with Taiwan
                    and normalized ties with the PRC [People's Republic of China]. Kissinger made
                    clear to the Chinese that we couldn't do that. Kissinger may have said that,
                    maybe some day or some day soon, but he said that we clearly weren't prepared to
                    do that at the time. We said, in effect, that perhaps we could normalize
                    relations if we could do it short of the Japanese formula, so long as we
                    recognized the principle of One China. Zhou Enlai picked up on that. He didn't
                    reject this but rather suggested that we try to get some language in the
                    communique. He actually put in the communique the language, the principle of One
                    China.</p>
                <p>We thought that this suggested that the Chinese perhaps were willing to settle
                    for something short of the Japan formula. We had essentially agreed to the term,
                    the principle of One China, in the Shanghai Communique, so we were somewhat
                    encouraged by the November 1973 trip.</p>
                <p>We agreed to expand the staff and functions of the Liaison Offices. We agreed to
                    more exchanges in various fields and tried to arrange for more trade. There was
                    some progress made on the claims and assets front. However, as I've said, there
                    was a somewhat more tentative mood in the discussions, on the whole.</p>
                <p>On the Mao meeting, as I've said, we were summoned, as usual, on short notice to
                    his simple residence in the Forbidden City. We entered the building. Inside
                    there was a ping pong table and then Mao's study with a semi-circle of
                    armchairs, with books all over the place, behind him, on the floor, and on
                    tables. I've already described Mao.</p>
                <pb facs="0423" n="Page0423"/>
                <p>This meeting with Mao lasted for three hours. Part of the reason for the length
                    was that Mao seemed to enjoy talking to Kissinger. We thought that it showed
                    confidence and that it was important. Partly, we thought, it was also because he
                    was providing somewhat more direct guidance than he did at the other meetings.
                    As we've said, he would provide these brush strokes, and then Zhou Enlai would
                    carry on at great length. Now Zhou was somewhat more restrained and subdued, and
                    Mao seemed to give somewhat more explicit guidance. At least in the course of
                    three hours more of their positions was spelled out than in an hour or an hour
                    and a half. Mao made some jokes about problems with the Soviets. The Soviets had
                    complained to Mao, and Mao said that it would take “10,000 years to solve this
                    problem.” Kosygin [former Soviet Prime Minister] had come on a visit to China,
                    and Mao made a great concession. Mao said that it would only take “9,000 years
                    to solve this problem.” There were jokes like that.</p>
                <p>The Chinese expressed some concern about US steadfastness in facing the Soviet
                    threat. Again, these were not as sharp as the attacks which we got from Deng
                    Xiaoping and others on d�tente a year or two later. There was a lot of
                    discussion with Mao on the Soviet question, Soviet relations with China, and
                    European issues. Mao already was experiencing some trouble in speaking. He had
                    to make a great effort.</p>
                <p>On Taiwan, Mao was relaxed. He basically said that China could do without Taiwan
                    for a hundred years. This was all in the course of discussions with Kissinger.
                    They talked about the Near East, including the Near Eastern countries that I
                    mentioned, starting with Turkey. On Japan Mao again talked about being
                    careful.</p>
                <p>All in all, this was a very long - unprecedented in length - and warm
                    conversation. Mao had summoned Kissinger during the middle of a reception that
                    was being held in his honor, I believe by George Bush, who was then the Chief of
                    the US Liaison Office in Beijing. The whole Diplomatic Corps in Beijing had been
                    invited to this reception. Kissinger had to miss that reception and we arrived
                    there late.</p>
                <p>This trip was the last, serious talks that Kissinger had with Zhou Enlai, because
                    Zhou seemed to be more seriously ill after that. Kissinger visited Zhou in a
                    hospital a year later for half an hour. Basically, we felt that Zhou was
                    increasingly subdued. In retrospect, we can see that now, since Mao was giving
                    more explicit instructions. Zhou was not only beginning to decline physically,
                    but also politically.</p>
                <p>We didn't return to China for another year until November 1974. My memory isn't
                    good enough to recall any significant happenings with China in the meantime. We
                    just kept working on the various issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0424" n="Page0424"/>
                <p>Q: Regarding the initial Chinese-American talks in 1973, one of the great ties
                    between China and the United States was American missionaries, who have had a
                    profound influence on relations between the two countries. Former missionaries,
                    or the children of American missionaries, have had an influence on
                    Chinese-American relations. Did missionaries come into these conversations,
                    either in terms of property or the ability to go back and do their work, or
                    anything else like that?</p>
                <p>LORD: I don't recall. This was a long time ago, and almost everconceivable
                    subject was discussed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The issue of missionaries wasn't on the front burner.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I don't recall that there were any American missionaries who went back to
                    China. This was not something that Kissinger had very high, if at all, on his
                    list of topics to raise with the Chinese. I don't believe that we were getting
                    any pressure from within the U.S. to raise the issue of missionaries. There may
                    have been some historical references.</p>
                <p>The next trip was in November 1974. On this occasion I went separately and met up
                    with Kissinger, who came from the Summit Meeting with the Russians in
                    Vladivostok. In retrospect, we felt later that maybe this wasn't the most clever
                    thing to do, Kissinger going to China directly from Vladivostok, in view of the
                    overtones. I remember going out to China with Bill Gleysteen in particular [then
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary for East Asian Affairs]. We were under instructions
                    from Kissinger to come up with formulas on Taiwan and different things that we
                    might try out and make further progress on.</p>
                <p>On this trip Deng Xiaoping was the host. Deng had made a comeback. He went down
                    again later, and then made another comeback later on. The first time that we
                    ever met Deng was when he headed the Chinese Delegation to the UN General
                    Assembly in New York a couple of months before that, in September or October
                    1974. We met Deng at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where our UN Ambassador has an
                    apartment.</p>
                <p>I recall that at the time we didn't know much about Deng. Initially, we were not
                    particularly impressed with him. We just felt that, after Zhou Enlai, he was a
                    let down. The initial meeting was at a working lunch or dinner. Deng was the
                    head of the Chinese Delegation to the UN General Assembly. We were struck by the
                    fact that Deng never mentioned Zhou Enlai's name once. We just generally were
                    not impressed with Deng at that first meeting. Of course, the times changed, and
                    given his political ups and downs in the mid-1970s, he was surely cautious at
                    that point.</p>
                <pb facs="0425" n="Page0425"/>
                <p>On the November 1974 visit, we specifically began to probe on the possibility of
                    making further progress on Taiwan. However, Deng stuck to a hard line on Taiwan.
                    We were not overly generous ourselves, either. By then the Watergate Affair was
                    behind us, so this was our first trip to China after Nixon had resigned and Ford
                    had become President. At the time of this trip to China, in November, 1974, Deng
                    himself was in a vulnerable position, trying to deal with the Gang of Four in
                    China. Zhou Enlai was declining in health and politically, and Madame Mao and
                    the other radicals in the Chinese Communist Party were jockeying for position
                    around Mao, trying to get his ear and so forth. Mao was obviously fading as
                    well. So Deng wasn't able to be very flexible on many issues, especially one as
                    sensitive as Taiwan. He couldn't afford to look 'soft'.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you feel any reflection of U.S. developments, when the Watergate Affair
                    heated up and President Nixon had to resign? Were these developments interpreted
                    by the Chinese in the sense that Nixon had opened up U.S. relations with China
                    but Right Wing American elements brought him down?</p>
                <p>LORD: I'm thinking of Mao and Zhou Enlai in particular, who indicated that the
                    Watergate Affair was our business. The general tone expressed by the Chinese
                    about Watergate was that this was a case of breaking wind. They considered it no
                    big deal and clearly wondered why everyone was so excited about it. They were
                    not explicit; they were not inclined to talk about it because they figured that
                    this was a domestic issue for us to deal with. There was no evidence that they
                    thought that this had anything to do with China. It plainly puzzled them because
                    they just didn't understand our system. They wondered why a third-rate burglary
                    could bring President Nixon down, particularly when he had done great things,
                    such as achieving the opening to China. The Chinese were somewhat baffled by it
                    and were somewhat contemptuous of American puritanical attitudes, and so on, or
                    even of democracy as such. I don't believe that the Chinese thought that the
                    Watergate Affair was somehow related to China. If anything, they may have
                    thought, again incorrectly, that d�tente with the Russians was beginning to
                    create some trouble for President Nixon. However, I don't think that the Chinese
                    thought that the Watergate Affair was foreign policy related. They realized that
                    this was a domestic problem. They just wondered why America made such a big deal
                    out of it.</p>
                <p>I don't think that the Chinese ever expressed any particular view of the matter,
                    other than to indicate that they thought this was a domestic affair for us to
                    handle. There was no evidence that this had anything to do with China.</p>
                <p>Q: Since this interview is focused on you and your thought processes, when your
                    wife went to China with you in 1973, did she bring any different insights? After
                    all, she was talking to family members and getting out and around. Hers was
                    quite a different perspective than you would get from a bunch of Occidental
                    officials, sitting around in a reception area and talking to Chinese
                    officials.</p>
                <pb facs="0426" n="Page0426"/>
                <p>LORD: For listeners to and readers of these memoirs, I would refer them in
                    particular to my wife's book, Legacies - A Chinese Mosaic, which not only talks
                    about more recent events, like the Tiananmen Massacre, but Chinese recollections
                    of the Cultural Revolution, and some of Bette's experiences in going back to
                    China and our serving there.</p>
                <p>She returned to China in November 1973 for the first time since leaving in 1946.
                    All of her relatives were there, beside her two sisters, one of whom escaped in
                    the early 1960s (she wrote a book about it, Eighth Moon.) and her parents.
                    Before I arrived, she saw relatives, for example, in Tianjin. They had moved
                    homes just before she arrived back in China. They were living much better than
                    they had been. My wife couldn't understand why her aunt and uncle didn't seem to
                    know their way around their own house. They had to figure out where the
                    silverware was. This was kind of puzzling at the time. Clearly, the government
                    had given the relatives better quarters to impress Bette. Obviously, the
                    sidewalk and everything else had been spruced up as well.</p>
                <p>My wife had already begun to hear horror stories about the Cultural Revolution,
                    including how her uncle, her grandmother, and others had suffered during it. She
                    planned to write a book, based on these experiences. Then she realized that this
                    would have been politically too sensitive for them. They might have gotten into
                    trouble. She ended up writing “Spring Moon,” a best-selling novel, which had
                    nothing to do with her relatives.</p>
                <p>My wife always had a more hard-headed, negative impression of the communists and
                    what they had done to China. She was more skeptical about them. She fully
                    believed that the U.S. should open up relations with communist China, in our
                    own, hard-headed self-interest. She was very much in favor of that. However,
                    then and ever since, she has been more skeptical about Chinese actions and
                    perfidy, particularly in terms of the government and the system. Of course, her
                    friends and relatives made her feel that even more strongly.</p>
                <p>Q: Did the fact that you were getting this view from your wife have an impact on
                    your views? There would be conversations in the Office of Policy Planning, and
                    you might have said that the situation in China really isn't that euphoric.</p>
                <pb facs="0427" n="Page0427"/>
                <p>LORD: First of all, I must make it clear that she was very much in favor of the
                    opening to China and she thought that it was in our own national interest, even
                    if we had to hold our noses a little bit. Indeed, she made major contributions
                    to the relationship over the years, especially when I served as Ambassador. She
                    always placed greater emphasis on the human rights issue. I did as well,
                    certainly by comparison with Secretary Kissinger. However, she would put human
                    rights as the major item in the Chinese-American relationship or at least
                    thought that it should be among the major items. I've always held the view that
                    human rights are very important but should not control the whole relationship.
                    No single issue should hold our tries. But human rights is crucial in terms of
                    American domestic support and our values. I feel that at times we have to work
                    with some resignation as to how fast we can make progress. We need to do our
                    best and pursue other interests as well. There can never be really positive
                    relations so long as the Chinese government is so repressive and abusive of
                    human rights.</p>
                <p>So I can't say that my wife's perspectives greatly affected my own policy
                    judgments. I greatly respect her insights and believe that she instinctively
                    knows more about China than anyone else. For example, she predicted in the late
                    1960s that Deng Xiaoping would make a comeback before I got involved with China
                    in the early 1970s. She had her eye on Deng. I don't know anyone else who did.
                    She kept talking about the horrors of the Cultural Revolution when it was still
                    fashionable to overlook it or even justify it. So there always was that element,
                    and I thought that it was good to get a reality check through her. However,
                    despite this, she felt that we should go ahead anyway with the opening to China.
                    It didn't really have an impact on my policy judgments.</p>
                <p>Going back to the trip to China in November 1974, I have talked about the limits
                    on Deng and, to a certain extent, on ourselves. We proposed a lengthy,
                    communique draft which other people and I had worked on. It noted all of the
                    progress we were making, how we were moving ahead, and so on. We dealt with Qiao
                    Guanhua, the Vice Foreign Minister. He preferred a shorter communique draft. We
                    went on to Suzhou and its lovely gardens. So the trip was not negative, but
                    clearly the momentum was slowing down because of the domestic situation in both
                    countries. This was our first encounter with Deng in China, when he was the
                    host. This was the trip when Secretary and Mrs. Kissinger paid farewell call to
                    Zhou Enlai in the hospital.</p>
                <p>I'm just doing an account of the various trips, at this point. haven't tried to
                    reconstruct specific events in between.</p>
                <p>Q: With regard to policy planning, was there a change when Ford became President?
                    Obviously, Nixon had a very hands on knowledge of foreign affairs. I would
                    imagine that there would have been a real White House input into policy planning
                    during the Nixon years. How was the situation when Ford became President? Ford
                    did not bring that kind of experience or real interest with him. Did you notice
                    a change in that connection?</p>
                <pb facs="0428" n="Page0428"/>
                <p>LORD: Since we are focusing on China today, we'll reserve a discussion of
                    Kissinger for another time. Just to answer your question in general, President
                    Nixon, as the Watergate Affair began to preoccupy him, became less and less
                    involved in the details of foreign policy. More and more, Kissinger was
                    reporting to him and keeping him informed. Obviously, Kissinger was more and
                    more on his own. So Kissinger, by virtue of being Secretary of State now, was
                    wearing both hats. He was also still National Security Adviser. He totally
                    dominated US foreign policy even during the last year or two, when Nixon was
                    President, since Nixon was so preoccupied with the problems related to the
                    Watergate Affair.</p>
                <p>President Ford had less interest and less knowledge and experience in foreign
                    policy. This meant that Secretary Kissinger dominated foreign policy to an even
                    greater extent. Ford's primary purpose was to heal the country after the
                    Watergate Affair and to focus on our domestic scene. That was consistent with
                    Ford's background, but it was also his top priority at that point. So President
                    Ford basically left it to Kissinger to run our foreign policy. He had total
                    confidence in him. Kissinger in turn respected Ford and of course got his
                    approval on major issues and went to him for major decisions.</p>
                <p>We've had other examples like that in our history, although perhaps not quite so
                    extreme. President Eisenhower was heavily involved in our foreign policy, but he
                    left it to Secretary of State Dulles to run the basic operation. For a time,
                    especially early on, President Clinton didn't focus all of that much on foreign
                    policy. President Carter preserved a sort of balance between Zbigniew Brzezinski
                    [then National Security Adviser] and Cyrus Vance [then Secretary of State] in
                    foreign policy. Under Nixon the White House dominated foreign policy, of course.
                    The State Department dominated foreign policy under Ford because even with his
                    two hats Kissinger essentially operated out of the Department. President Reagan
                    delegated a lot of responsibility to Shultz. President Bush (senior), on the
                    other hand was more concerned with foreign policy than domestic policy. So we
                    have had a variety of ways of handling foreign policy, and therefore diverse
                    profiles of National Security Advisors and Secretaries of State. But to return
                    to your question, yes, Ford was less interested in foreign policy.</p>
                <p>We didn't feel any great shift because during the final few months of the Nixon
                    administration, Kissinger was running foreign policy. Watergate totally tied up
                    President Nixon. Already there was the feeling that, by virtue of being
                    Secretary of State, Kissinger was running the show anyway. That situation
                    continued under President Ford, so there wasn't any great shift for that reason.
                    Obviously, there was a considerable contrast, say, between 1969 and 1973, but
                    not much contrast, say, between 1973 and 1974. As for State Department policy
                    planning, the staff didn't play much of a role when Nixon and the NSC ran
                    foreign policy, before I took over the policy planning staff. After that, of
                    course, we played a much more important role. I believe, thanks to our various
                    assets and advantages that I have cited elsewhere, the influence of the policy
                    planning staff was the greatest since the Kennan/Nitze years. Some, outside the
                    staff, called our time “the golden years.”</p>
                <pb facs="0429" n="Page0429"/>
                <p>The next trip to China took place in October, 1975. The object there was to
                    prepare for a visit to China by President Ford in December, 1975. On this
                    particular trip, both Mrs. Kissinger and my wife were members of the official
                    party. This was the most unpleasant, frosty trip of all of the trips I made to
                    China from 1971 to 1976. The Chinese were very cold on substance, at meetings,
                    and in their public toasts. They were very tough on d�tente and alleged that we
                    were being na�ve about the Russians. I don't know when they first made the
                    allegation that we were, in effect, standing on their shoulders to reach toward
                    Moscow and so forth, but that was their attitude. They really were quite tough,
                    in public as well as in private.</p>
                <p>During this trip Kissinger saw Mao again, and it still was quite a friendly talk,
                    despite what I've just said. However, Mao was very sick by this time. He spoke
                    in grunts and wrote things down. I used to joke that Mao would speak in a grunt
                    for, perhaps, 10 seconds, then his interpreter would hold forth for, perhaps,
                    two minutes. I suggested that Mao would attach a number to each policy
                    formulation, and relay it to his interpreter. Number One was Taiwan, Number Two
                    was Russia, Number Three was Japan, etc. Mao would whisper the number, and then
                    the interpreter would give the standard policy line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't the interpreter the only one who supposedly
                        coulunderstand what Mao was saying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: She was Nancy Tang. Mao had a very heavy, Hunan accent, among other things.
                    Also, it wasn't only a matter of understanding his accent. It was a matter of
                    understanding him at all. Mao was writing things down and getting very feeble,
                    but he still seemed quite sharp. We were trying to prepare a communique for the
                    Ford visit, even as we had prepared the Shanghai Communique in 1971 for the
                    Nixon visit. The Chinese resisted and rejected mentioning any real, substantive
                    progress in the communique. We had a draft communique which we gave them. They
                    sat on it for two days and then came back and poured cold water all over it. So
                    we left China, resigning ourselves to making further preparations for the visit
                    through cable traffic.</p>
                <p>The reasons for this were essentially domestic politics on both sides. Deng was
                    really fighting for the succession to Mao, who clearly was in his final months.
                    Zhou Enlai was also in his final months of life and no longer an influence. Deng
                    could not afford to look soft, vis-�-vis America, especially on the most
                    sensitive issue, Taiwan. By this time President Ford was beginning to think
                    about his reelection. I can't remember when Reagan began to emerge as a rival to
                    Ford in the campaign for the Republican nomination for the 1976 elections.
                    However, Ford had to watch his conservative flank, particularly on the issue of
                    Taiwan. So the Chinese couldn't do anything on Taiwan, and we couldn't do
                    anything on Taiwan, either. On this trip, as well as on other trips, we said
                    that Ford planned to normalize diplomatic relations with China once he was
                    reelected. However, he couldn't do anything before the 1976 presidential
                    elections.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0430" n="Page0430"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was any thought given to canceling Ford's trip to
                        China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: There was no thought of canceling it. However, we were very unhappy when we
                    left China because we saw this as a trip without any results and, perhaps, even
                    without a friendly reception. There we were having to rely on cable traffic now.
                    We had no agreement on the communique and we didn't know what the outcome was
                    going to be. This was in considerable contrast to the meticulous and positive
                    preparations for the Nixon visit at an earlier stage in our relationship.</p>
                <p>As we got back to Washington, James Schlesinger was fired as Secretary of
                    Defense. He had just returned from a visit to China. The Chinese really liked
                    him because he followed a particularly hard line on Russia and was friendly
                    toward China. Kissinger lost his job as National Security Adviser. Kissinger was
                    very upset and started talking privately about resigning. At the time there were
                    long discussions between Kissinger, Scowcroft, Eagleburger, and myself.
                    Sometimes, Kissinger brought in outsiders like David Bruce, and Bill Simon about
                    whether or not Kissinger should resign, essentially since he had lost his NSC
                    [National Security Council] hat. He had voiced such threats before, but it got
                    quite serious when contingency planning began and drafts of letters of
                    resignation began to be prepared.</p>
                <p>There was even a Sunday, near the Christmas holidays, when I remember Kissinger
                    saying farewell to Larry Eagleburger and me at the State Department. He said
                    that he was on his way to see President Ford, bringing with him a draft letter
                    of resignation.</p>
                <p>Kissinger finally stayed in office because of considerations of the substance of
                    issues outstanding. Also, the more we drafted letters of rationale for his
                    resigning, the more we - and he - realized that Kissinger really didn't have a
                    good reason for doing this. Just because Kissinger had lost his NSC hat, this
                    didn't mean that it was the end of the world. We were concerned about the
                    suddenness of the impact on American national interest. Literally, Eagleburger
                    and I prepared about a dozen draft letters of resignation, but we just couldn't
                    find a credible explanation for Kissinger's resignation. As we got close to
                    Christmas, Kissinger agreed, after all of these meetings with people and
                    thinking the matter through, to put the matter aside and think about it again
                    after the holidays. In the course of the Christmas and New Year's holidays,
                    Kissinger decided to remain in office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sparked this change?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0431" n="Page0431"/>
                <p>LORD: It was in part Kissinger's concern that President Ford was putting him down
                    somewhat, probably out of concern about his conservative flank. Later, President
                    Ford made Rockefeller resign, and replaced him with Robert Dole as a candidate,
                    a huge mistake which may have cost him the election. Of course, Rockefeller and
                    Kissinger were very close. Ford also appointed Donald Rumsfeld as Secretary of
                    Defense. Rumsfeld had been chief of staff to President Ford. Kissinger saw these
                    developments as a possible threat to his position. But the primary consideration
                    was Kissinger's losing his NSC hat. He felt that in the eyes of leaders around
                    the world and of his own prestige, this was really a put down. Of course, in
                    that respect, this was an overreaction. He was still someone whom Ford depended
                    the most on in foreign policy. Ford felt that conservative elements in the
                    Republican Party were upset with Kissinger over d�tente with Russia, and other
                    issues. Ford was worried about his right flank. He didn't want Reagan to get the
                    Republican nomination. Ford was sucking up to the conservatives in the
                    Republican Party. That's why later he dropped Rockefeller, and that's probably
                    why he downgraded Kissinger, from Kissinger's point of view. Kissinger felt that
                    conservative Republicans didn't like the policies he advocated, particularly on
                    d�tente with the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>So for all of these reasons Kissinger felt that he was losing influence in the
                    Ford administration, and his ego was hurt. This was pretty ridiculous because
                    Kissinger was still dominant and was still the Secretary of State. The more we
                    tried to construct a suitable letter of resignation, the more we had trouble in
                    explaining why Kissinger was quitting. However, that was his mood at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>Now let's get back to the December 1975 Ford trip to China. We decided to get
                    tough with the Chinese. We really didn't like the reception we had during the
                    October meetings in Beijing. So in follow up cable traffic we did the following.
                    The original Ford trip was supposed to be only to China and for several days, or
                    maybe as long as a week, to include visits to Beijing and a couple of other
                    cities in addition. In subsequent message traffic we informed the Chinese,
                    politely, in a matter-of-fact way, but unmistakably as a result of our frosty
                    reception in China that President Ford would only be able to go to Beijing. He
                    would just spend a couple of days in Beijing. And we said, by the way, he was
                    not only going to China but also to Indonesia and the Philippines. This made an
                    Asian trip by contrast to the original idea of President Ford's trip to China
                    alone.</p>
                <p>We wanted to get the attention of the Chinese. We realized that we had not been
                    very nicely treated, both publicly and in private on the previous trip. There
                    wasn't any meaningful outcome shaping up for this Ford visit to China.</p>
                <p>We did get the attention of the Chinese. They immediately began to warm up in the
                    cables exchanged and in their contacts, through the two liaison offices. The
                    Chinese affirmed their desire to have President Ford visit China and promised
                    him a very warm welcome. Sometimes, you have to play things this way with the
                    Chinese.</p>
                <pb facs="0432" n="Page0432"/>
                <p>So President Ford went to China in December, 1975, with visits to the Philippines
                    and Indonesia afterwards. We flew out again to China on Air Force One via
                    Anchorage, Alaska, and visited the petroleum pipeline in Alaska. I remember
                    listening on the plane, even as we went out there, to the incredible football
                    game between the Washington Redskins and the Minnesota Vikings. There was the
                    usual hectic, last minute work on briefing books and toasts. After China,
                    Indonesia, and the Philippines, the President stopped off in Hawaii and gave a
                    major speech on his Pacific Doctrine. We went to Japan.</p>
                <p>The Chinese public reception of President Ford was essentially a replay of the
                    Nixon visit. I would have thought that the reception would have warmed up by
                    then. However, we got the same, austere greeting at the Beijing airport. There
                    were the same, welcoming banquets. The Chinese were very careful to do the same
                    things that they had done for President Nixon. Of course, the reception did not
                    seem as exciting and dramatic to the American people and to everyone else, since
                    we had been through this process before. The Diplomatic Corps was at the
                    welcoming banquet in Beijing.</p>
                <p>Some members of the Ford party had the chance to shake Mao's hand before we had
                    the meeting with him. I remember that there was the usual scramble as to who was
                    going to attend the meeting on our side. I was included, as were Brent Scowcroft
                    [National Security Adviser] and George Bush [at the time the Chief of the U.S.
                    Liaison Office and later President of the U.S.]. Some of the White House staff,
                    including Dick Cheney [chief of staff of the White House] and Ron Nessin, tried
                    to force their way in. However, the Chinese Protocol Officer, Mr. Tang, kept
                    them out.</p>
                <p>Mao had about an hour's meeting with President Ford. Mao agreed with Ford on most
                    issues. At the very beginning, and this is a semi-amusing story, Mao repeated
                    his comment that he would soon receive an invitation from God. President Ford
                    looked a little puzzled at this. He didn't seem to understand that this was
                    Mao's elliptical way of referring to his forthcoming death. So, when we left the
                    meeting, Ford went up to Mao and said something to the effect: “I'm going to
                    overrule Kissinger and make sure that you get that invitation from God very
                    soon.” Ford obviously did not know what Mao's reference to an invitation from
                    God really meant. Kissinger and I were aghast. However, the interpreter fielded
                    the comment and surely said: “The President wishes you 10,000 years of life,” or
                    something like that. The meeting between Mao and President Ford was quite
                    friendly. Mao agreed with the President on most issues. Unlike the trip to China
                    in October 1975, the Chinese went out of their way to be more friendly to
                    Secretary Kissinger personally, and showed greater respect for him. The White
                    House staff was less friendly and gave Secretary Kissinger and me lousy
                    treatment, including room assignments. There was obviously a little bit of
                    tension between Kissinger and the White House domestic staff. I was kept out of
                    the official party for the visit to Indonesia and didn't go to the dinner with
                    President Suharto, and so on.</p>
                <pb facs="0433" n="Page0433"/>
                <p>Deng Xiaoping made somewhat of a better impression on us during this trip and
                    particularly handled the American press effectively. The fact is that there was
                    really no substantive outcome to this visit, even though the Chinese were
                    correct and certainly didn't insult President Ford. They gave President Ford
                    basically the same reception that they had given to President Nixon. But it was
                    pretty easy to see that there wasn't much in the visit. We didn't even have a
                    communique.</p>
                <p>However, after the official meeting and in a seemingly casual encounter Deng and
                    President Ford answered reporters' questions. One of the questions was about the
                    absence of a communique. Deng answered that there was no need for a communique.
                    The discussions that had been held were themselves the key element. Relations
                    between the US and China were good and getting better. In fact, they really
                    weren't. Relations weren't slipping back, but they clearly weren't improving.
                    Deng showed that he was becoming adept at spin control and was trying to help us
                    out in getting through this. I think that he considered this a holding action,
                    aware of the domestic constraints on both sides. As he proved later, Deng was
                    very much in favor of strong relations between the US and China. He also knew
                    that, given our own domestic constraints, as well as Deng's domestic problems,
                    there wasn't much of an opportunity to move relations forward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Mme. Mao play any role in this meeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No. We never saw her at all. During the visit to China by President Nixon
                    she took Nixon one evening to one of those horrible ballets which were staged
                    during the Cultural Revolution.</p>
                <p>I've already indicated why President Ford and the Chinese were somewhat
                    constrained. Kissinger and I made a sentimental, farewell visit to the Forbidden
                    City. We figured that this might be the last China trip, even though there was
                    another year to go in President Ford's term. We had tea in the same spot where
                    we had tea during the secret trip in July 1971.</p>
                <p>Then President Ford went on to Indonesia and the Philippines, with Mrs. Marcos
                    overseeing the Tinikling bamboo stick dances. There was an incredible motorcade
                    in the Philippines. We went to Japan while the President went to Hawaii to give
                    his Pacific Doctrine speech.</p>
                <p>Then, in 1976 nothing really happened regarding China. Things slowed down in
                    terms of foreign policy generally. We didn't go back to China. Relations didn't
                    turn sour, but we were basically just treading water. And, of course, both Mao
                    and Zhou Enlai died during 1976. There was also the symbolic and incredible
                    earthquake in Tianjin, a Chinese symbol of dynastic change.</p>
                <pb facs="0434" n="Page0434"/>
                <p>Q: When the U.S. Liaison Office was first set up in Beijing, can you talk about
                    its role as you saw it? What about the various people who served in it?</p>
                <p>LORD: During the trip to China in February, 1973, we agreed to establish the
                    Liaison Offices, and these were up and running a few months after that.</p>
                <p>We had co-leaders of the Liaison Office at first, in the persons of John
                    Holdridge and Al Jenkins of the State Department. They basically handled
                    bilateral issues like trade, cultural exchanges, and claims and assets on a day
                    to day basis. The heavy lifting on important, sensitive, and geopolitical issues
                    was still handled by Secretary Kissinger. We used the Chinese Liaison Office in
                    Washington. I don't believe that we used the Paris channel any further, since we
                    had a Chinese Ambassador available in Washington.</p>
                <p>Q: So much of what we were trying to do was to set up this relationship. Maybe
                    this is just your perspective of this, but it sounds as if the Liaison Offices
                    were really playing a very subordinate role, compared to Embassies in other
                    countries.</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, you have to see how Kissinger dealt with Ambassadors. Basically, when
                    he was Secretary of State, he would use our Ambassadors a lot more than he would
                    use them when he was not Secretary of State. He used some of our Ambassadors,
                    like Herman Eilts in Egypt, and so on, a great deal. He had great respect for
                    Eilts and certain other Ambassadors. Even as he used Foreign Service Officers to
                    a great extent in Washington, I think that it's still fair to say that he didn't
                    fully employ his Ambassadors overseas on key issues. He would not always keep
                    them fully posted.</p>
                <p>As to the Liaison Office in Beijing, as I said, the two officers initially in
                    charge of it were John Holdridge and Al Jenkins. They were distinguished and
                    very knowledgeable diplomats. They were very good choices and very competent,
                    and Kissinger respected both of them. They were followed by senior heads (once
                    the office had been set up and running) David Bruce, then Gates from the Defense
                    Department, and George Bush after that. Everything that I've said was also true
                    regarding people after Holdridge and Jenkins. The basic, sensitive matters were
                    handled by Kissinger. You can apply that throughout this period. These were
                    matters handled by Kissinger in Washington. Now, whenever Kissinger traveled to
                    Beijing, the heads of the Liaison Office were fully included in whatever was
                    going on. They were kept well posted. I kept trying to encourage Kissinger to
                    bear in mind that the heads of the Liaison Office had to know what was going on.
                    However, there is no question that whenever there was heavy lifting on really
                    important and sensitive issues, this would be handled by Kissinger himself and
                    not by the head of the Liaison Office in Beijing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Kissinger was in Beijing or Deng was coming here
                        tWashington, how did Kissinger do his heavy lifting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0435" n="Page0435"/>
                <p>LORD: By talking to Huang Zhen or whoever was the head of the Chinese Liaison
                    Office in Washington. China had its own Liaison Office in Washington, after all.
                    So Kissinger would work with him and ask the head of the Chinese Liaison Office
                    to send messages back to Beijing. We generally kept our people in the US Liaison
                    Office in Beijing posted on what was going on. However, there might be things
                    that the chief of our Liaison Office in Beijing might not know. I always
                    encouraged Kissinger to keep our Liaison Office as well posted as possible. If a
                    sensitive matter were involved and Kissinger wanted the chief of our Liaison
                    Office to know about it, he could send an eyes only message, or a backchannel
                    message for the chief of the Liaison Office and not for other people in the
                    Liaison Office.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you see a parallel to the Kissinger-Dobrynin connection, where often our
                    Embassy in Moscow in effect was bypassed. The Embassy in Moscow might have been
                    informed, but the real contact was Kissinger talking to the Soviet Ambassador to
                    the United States. Was this kind of contact developing between the U.S. and
                    China?</p>
                <p>LORD: Certainly, there was an analogy there, because on really sensitive and
                    important matters Secretary Kissinger would handle them and he wouldn't
                    necessarily tell the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing after the fact. However,
                    this was by no means on the same scale. Now, with the Russians Kissinger had a
                    much more fully developed relationship. In many ways it was less friendly and
                    more dangerous. However, we had more business to transact, and it was a more
                    normal relationship. We had many more regular exchanges with the Russians. We
                    had official Embassies in each other's capital. We had negotiations on arms
                    control, we had trade agreements and other exchanges, we were negotiating on
                    Berlin and other issues. I often went to Moscow with Secretary Kissinger for
                    such purposes in discussions with Brezhnev, Gromyko, and so on. So there were
                    more subjects both for the Ambassadors but also more to keep them in the dark
                    about.</p>
                <p>This began to loosen up too. Don't forget that when Kissinger became Secretary of
                    State, and I want to stress this, not only was the Foreign Service more fully
                    brought into the discussions in Washington but our Ambassadors were much better
                    posted than when Kissinger was National Security Adviser in the White House.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you feel that it was part of your job, particularly regarding relations
                    with China, which you are reviewing here, to make sure that everybody was
                    singing from the same hymn book?</p>
                <p>LORD: Oh, sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was part of your brief?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0436" n="Page0436"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes. First, it was important for us to be consistent. Secondly, this was
                    essential for efficiency in the operation of our foreign policy. Thirdly, it was
                    important for our morale. I always tried to ensure that our people were kept
                    posted as much as possible, keeping secrecy to a minimum, in Kissinger's own
                    self interest and in the American national interest. This was also important to
                    maintaining the morale and efficiency of our own people.So the situation was by
                    no means as it was in the early 1970s under President Nixon. We would brief the
                    chiefs of the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing before they went out to China. I
                    was responsible for doing that, in coordination with the East Asian bureau and
                    the White House. I remember spending an entire day with George Bush before he
                    went out to Beijing as Chief of the Liaison Office. That was also true of David
                    Bruce and Gates, as well.</p>
                <p>Q: What about David Bruce? He was, perhaps, our most distinguished diplomat. He
                    had been Ambassador to all of the major, Western European countries. What was
                    his attitude toward this assignment as chief of the U.S. Liaison Office, and how
                    did he operate?</p>
                <p>LORD: First of all, he was chosen by President Nixon and Kissinger. As you say,
                    he was very effective and distinguished. We wanted to get some elevation in this
                    appointment. It was only a Liaison Office. We wanted to make clear to the world
                    and to the Chinese that we had picked someone who was at the very top of our
                    diplomats. He was, in one sense, a political appointee but he was a
                    distinguished and experienced person who enjoyed a very good reputation. I think
                    that Kissinger felt also that David Bruce was very reliable. He was fairly old
                    by this point, in his 70s. Given the limited nature of what you could do with
                    that Liaison Office, in view of the restraints on travel and contacts with
                    Chinese society, this really was a constrained operation in many ways, even
                    without Kissinger's secretiveness. So Ambassador Bruce didn't need a great deal
                    of energy in this position. He was competent and good and was a terrific human
                    being. He was one of my heroes. Kissinger used him as a guru on other occasions,
                    like the energy crisis, and when he considered resigning.</p>
                <p>I think that Bruce would be the first to say that, by virtue of the nature of the
                    job, our lack of diplomatic relations, and the limited scope, he wasn't really a
                    diplomat. He couldn't really mingle much with the diplomatic community. He did
                    not have much access to Chinese society outside the official community or much
                    access to top Chinese officials. This was also true of Gates and George Bush,
                    when they were Chiefs of the Liaison Office in Beijing. There was only so much
                    that Bruce could do, so he wasn't exactly working himself to death.</p>
                <p>As I recall, Bruce didn't do a great deal of reporting from China, either.
                    However, this is not meant in criticism of him. As I said, he was one of my
                    heroes. He played more of a symbolic role at that point. As I recall, Gates was
                    not in Beijing very long. He seemed to do a competent job. George Bush was
                    clearly the most enthusiastic Chief of the Liaison Office in Beijing. As you may
                    recall, he had been the head of the Republican National Committee. He was called
                    back from Beijing to become Director of the CIA, about the same time as the
                    other personnel shifts in October 1975.</p>
                <pb facs="0437" n="Page0437"/>
                <p>Some people, particularly of Bruce's, or Bush's, distinction and background,
                    might have said: “This is a Liaison Office, and I am not even an Ambassador. Why
                    should I want to do this?” However, Bush was genuinely interested in China, and
                    he threw himself into the job with great enthusiasm. He rode around Beijing on a
                    bicycle. He did as good a job as he could have, given the constraints. As he
                    himself would say, and did say so in his memoirs, he was kept posted by
                    Secretary Kissinger, but in fact there was not much important for him to do.
                    There wasn't much that Bush could do, but he did what he could do, within those
                    constraints. I was responsible, working with EAP, to make sure that he was
                    informed about what was going on.</p>
                <p>Q: Were we looking towards tying China into the Western world as much as possible
                    by student exchanges, opening more Consulates, and getting more traffic back and
                    forth? Or had it reached that point?</p>
                <p>LORD: This was beginning to happen. You have to remember that this was before
                    Deng launched his reforms in 1978. On the one hand China was emerging from the
                    Cultural Revolution and from near total isolation. In the early 1970s, it
                    recalled all its Ambassadors abroad except one, Huang Hua, in Cairo. By virtue
                    of the opening with us, as they knew they made breakthroughs with others like
                    Japan and parts of Europe that hadn't normalized relations as yet. They got into
                    the United Nations. So they were beginning to open up diplomatically in that
                    sense. However, trade was still very restricted, Chinese society was politically
                    very restrictive, and their own people were very carefully managed. Even on the
                    exchange of persons front, the Chinese were very cautious. They began to agree
                    to some exchanges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By exchanges you mean cultural exchanges.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Cultural exchanges, including sports teams and academics, as well as trade.
                    So we made progress in relative terms, including on trade, during these years.
                    However, trade was miniscule, compared to the time when I was Ambassador to
                    China, and even more so, compared to today. It was more a matter of building
                    constituencies to support the relationship on both sides and giving it some
                    content. There wasn't any feeling that we could open up China at that point. The
                    Chinese were just too cautious to make that possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we seeing much of the tail end of the Cultural
                        Revolution,the Gang of Four, and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0438" n="Page0438"/>
                <p>LORD: The official end of the Cultural Revolution was in 1976, though the worse
                    excesses were in the late 1960s. I don't want to get my sequence of events
                    wrong. The Gang of Four was blamed for the Cultural Revolution after this
                    period. As I recall, this was during the period of the Carter administration.
                    Deng returned to office in 1977 and solidified his position once again, pushing
                    out Hua Guofeng, who in turn had ousted the Gang of Four. So the blame for the
                    Cultural Revolution was not attributed when we were in office. Much of the
                    material is already in the history books. In 1976 both Mao and Zhou Enlai died.
                    There was a temporary elevation of Hua Guofeng. Mao said that with Hua Guofeng
                    in charge, he was at ease. Hua Guofeng was gradually pushed aside by Deng over
                    the next year or two. The Gang of Four was arrested and tried. All of this is in
                    the history books. The reforms didn't really take hold until Deng came back to
                    power for the third time in 1977-78.</p>
                <p>Q: When you were the Director of the Office of Policy Planning during this time,
                    for you were in that position for, what, three and one-half years, we already
                    had a well developed group of Kremlinologists who followed developments in the
                    Soviet Union. They figured out who was standing where and the significance of
                    where they stood on public occasions on Lenin's Tomb, and so forth. They had a
                    very sophisticated ability to read Soviet newspapers and figure out what was
                    happening. They really had quite an insight into what was going on. Did you find
                    that you had any of that kind of expertise or apparatus to follow the situation
                    in China?</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, we had some of that. We respected them, whether they were in INR
                    [Bureau of Intelligence Research], the CIA, other parts of the intelligence
                    community, the Department of State, the NSC, or among some outside academics and
                    specialists. We would seek out their views as much as possible. Dick Solomon was
                    in the White House and was a scholar on China. However, in those days a lot of
                    the China watching was still done in Hong Kong, through our Consulate General
                    there. That was our key source of information. We interviewed refugees who came
                    out of China and used other contacts. So even after we had a Liaison Office in
                    Beijing, the Consulate General in Hong Kong probably produced more material on
                    China. The Liaison Office could give us some material, but the restrictions on
                    their travel and contacts meant that they really couldn't tell us a great deal
                    about what was going on in China.</p>
                <p>So we never felt that we knew a great deal about China. Certainly, we learned a
                    lot as we established ourselves there. And, of course, journalists began to take
                    up residence in China after a while. However, it wasn't really until the
                    normalization of diplomatic relations in 1979 that things began to open up,
                    especially in terms of exchanges and access. We began to get a lot of reporting
                    out of China itself to supplement what we were getting from the Consulate
                    General in Hong Kong. I don't think that we really thought that we had as good a
                    feel for what was going on in China as we did for what was going on in the
                    Soviet Union, and even there we had problems, of course.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, it was also as difficult a situation as you could have, since this
                    essentially was an ongoing coup or revolution and all of that.</p>
                <pb facs="0439" n="Page0439"/>
                <p>LORD: Oh, you're talking about the power struggle within China. I don't want to
                    pretend to precision here, when my memory can play tricks. I think that we
                    realized even then that Hua Guofeng was not a dominant figure. He was a sort of
                    surprising, safe choice. I'm sure that we must have speculated whether this man
                    was going to last. I don't know whether we thought that Deng might come back
                    again. I don't know whether we were that prescient. I'm sure that we had some
                    feel for the struggle between the radicals and the moderates, but I don't think
                    that we had any precise handle on that.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: I was wondering to what extent you had contacts with
                    the Nationalist Chinese on Taiwan and to what extent you were perhaps preparing
                    studies on what was likely to happen if normalization went on? To what extent
                    was Taiwan a concern in this context?</p>
                <p>LORD: Whenever we had contact with Taiwan, it was done by the Taiwan Desk, Bureau
                    of East Asian Affairs, as I recall. I had a great personal respect and affection
                    for Taiwan. I thought that we should not sell them out, and I don't think that
                    we ever did that. I was always careful to urge that we maintain good relations
                    with Taiwan, both in terms of its reputation and our own historical obligations
                    toward it, as well as in terms of domestic U.S. support for Taiwan. We had to
                    make sure that we didn't stir up the more conservative people in the United
                    States. As I said, my wedding reception was given at the Chinese Nationalist
                    Embassy residence, Twin Oaks, in Washington, DC, and my father-in-law
                    represented the Taiwan government on sugar.</p>
                <p>However, I don't recall having that much contact with the Chinese Nationalists. I
                    think that that was left to the Taiwan Desk. With Beijing we basically gave up
                    in 1975 and 1976 any hope of making any progress on the Taiwan issue at least
                    until after the 1976 election. We went through a lot of contingency planning
                    regarding the impact on Taiwan of the normalization of relations with Mainland
                    China. We considered various formulas. We realized that the Chinese communists
                    were not in the mood domestically, and certainly President Ford was not in the
                    mood, to take any chances. So that was essentially a holding action, although we
                    would tell the Chinese that we wanted to keep moving forward on this issue. We
                    said that we would revisit this issue after the election, when President Ford
                    would have a freer hand and would not have to look over his shoulder at Ronald
                    Reagan.</p>
                <p>At one point, I, Dick Soloman (NSC), and either Hummel or Gleysteen of EAP sent a
                    memo to Kissinger urging more progress on the Taiwan issue, but the time was not
                    ripe.</p>
                <p>I don't recall that Taiwan was a major area of concern. However, if I had been
                    working in EAP at the time, I would probably have a fuller answer for you.</p>
                <pb facs="0440" n="Page0440"/>
                <p>Q: You were looking at Ronald Reagan at this point as the point man for
                    conservative Republicans. Is that right? Were you thinking that if he were to
                    take over the Republican Party instead of President Ford at that time, that this
                    could really set back our China policy?</p>
                <p>LORD: I guess so, but the fact was that I personally never thought, perhaps
                    na�vely, that Reagan had any chance to win the Republican nomination for
                    President. I guess that the contest was closer than people realized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the 1976 presidential elections.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I don't remember worrying about that too much because I figured that Reagan
                    was never going to be elected. I personally was very upset with President Ford
                    for dropping Nelson Rockefeller as candidate for Vice President. I was a great
                    Rockefeller fan. This annoyed me, but that's neither here nor there.</p>
                <p>You have to remember that President Ford, although he relied heavily on Secretary
                    Kissinger, was beginning to be concerned about the conservative Republicans. I
                    don't think that Kissinger attended the Republican Convention in 1976. There
                    were a lot of attacks on Kissinger at that time, especially on d�tente. Not so
                    much on China policy, which was still widely supported, because those who
                    thought we were soft on the Soviets saw the advantage of dealing with the
                    Chinese.</p>
                <p>Again, I may have been na�ve, but I don't think that I ever believed that Reagan
                    was going to be the Republican nominee. I didn't think that this was going to be
                    a problem. If I ever did, then I'm sure I would have thought that it wasn't
                    going to be very positive for our China policy.</p>
                <p>Q: What about China in the UN? Were we holding our breath about what China was
                    going to do? Did we expect that they were going to act like the new boy on the
                    block?</p>
                <p>LORD: China was basically a cipher at the UN in those days. They didn't do
                    anything. They just sort of attended the sessions. I don't think that they used
                    their veto power, as I recall. They generally voted against the U.S., but they
                    weren't active in doing so. They didn't try to do very much. They were very low
                    key at this point.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: Very little, as I recall. I'm trying to think about the whole issue of
                    possible military cooperation, but I don't recall any particular details. When I
                    was Ambassador, of course, in the late 1980s the Defense Department was heavily
                    involved.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: I'm not exactly sure, either.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I believe that the answer to your question is that the Department of
                    Defense was not heavily involved in our China relationship at this time. We
                    thought that it was still rather sensitive to be developing a military
                    relationship with the Chinese at this point. We had not fully normalized our
                    relations with China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: I had nothing specific in mind. I
                        wajust curious about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: China policy was run by the State Department and Secretary Kissinger,
                    although, as I say, Dick Solomon of the NSC was involved in most issues.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, in Policy Planning one likes to think that your people are planning
                    policies regarding possible developments 10 years from now. However, the reality
                    is that you tend to deal with matters at hand. Was anybody thinking that, maybe,
                    some time China was going to be an aggressive power and that we should think
                    about some problems in its neighborhood?</p>
                <p>LORD: I don't recall that, but you have to remember that this was a long time
                    ago. Certainly, we didn't have the kind of debate that we have today because
                    China, its economy, and its military establishment were all weak. China was just
                    coming out of diplomatic isolation. So concern with China in those days was more
                    a matter of whether they were fooling around with revolutions abroad, like in
                    Southeast Asia, as opposed to any projection of a military threat.</p>
                <p>We saw China as actually weak, although we all felt that, given their history and
                    the inherent greatness of the Chinese people and civilization, they would make a
                    comeback some day. However, this was thought to be some time away. I don't
                    recall any long term projections about what the Chinese would do when they
                    became strong. In Policy Planning I basically handled the China brief myself.
                    However, I want to make clear that I worked with EAP most of the time, and Dick
                    Solomon was very helpful in this regard, helping with some excellent materials
                    and analysis.</p>
                <p>Q: What about China and Africa? This is one area where the Chinese invested quite
                    a bit of money, including in Mozambique, West Africa, and other places. What did
                    we think of this?</p>
                <pb facs="0442" n="Page0442"/>
                <p>LORD: The Chinese had some interests in Africa at the time. Remember that in
                    Angola, the Russians and the Cubans were backing one faction, the Chinese were
                    backing another faction, and we were backing a third faction. In the general,
                    geopolitical game Kissinger welcomed any Chinese influence that would offset
                    Soviet influence in Africa or anywhere else. He kept the Chinese briefed on his
                    African diplomacy, including working with the South Africans to reach a deal on
                    Rhodesia, which later became Zimbabwe. He did that for geopolitical reasons. In
                    fact, to his credit, and that of President Ford, Kissinger did that even in the
                    midst of presidential primary elections in Texas and other states. This didn't
                    sit well with conservatives in the South.</p>
                <p>Africa would come up in conversations with the Chinese, but it wasn't a major
                    issue. The Chinese did have interests in Africa, as you say, and we, of course,
                    welcomed their interest in Africa. We didn't see this as any threat to us,
                    unlike, say, the efforts of the Russians.XVI. COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS.OTHER

                <p>Q: Well, now you've left the Policy Planning Staff. I'd like to talk about what
                    you did after that and also your role when you were outside the government but
                    still clued in, still being a resource and a prod.</p>
                <p>LORD: Right. During my career I developed a pattern of going in and out of
                    government service, for a variety of reasons. As I said, I started out as a
                    Foreign Service Officer. Then I became a Civil Service Officer, then a Schedule
                    C person, a Reagan political appointee, and finally a Clinton political
                    appointee. I went in and out of government service several times for a variety
                    of reasons.</p>
                <p>First, to make sure that I saw more of my family, and particularly mkids, when
                    they were growing up. Secondly...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many children do you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Two kids. I think that I mentioned them earlier: Lisa and Winston.
                    Secondly, I felt that if you get overexhausted, you are less effective.
                    Therefore, I desired to recharge my batteries physically and even mentally, in
                    terms of the strain involved in government service. Thirdly, to give myself a
                    chance to read and reflect. I usually figured that I would eventually go back
                    into government service, recharged, as it were. Fourthly, I had a conscious
                    feeling in my life that work isn't everything and that I wanted to have time to
                    have a slightly less frenetic working life and be able to pursue other
                    interests, whether these involved sports, culture, reading, or whatever.
                    Finally, I was never under any financial pressures, so I could afford to leave
                    government service and not worry about having an immediate job or the need to
                    make a lot of money.</p>

                <p>So the first time I left government service was in May 1973, just for a few
                    months. I had been on the NSC [National Security Council] staff. Then Kissinger
                    called me back in when he became Secretary of State in September 1973. We've
                    already covered that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, what was your wife's reaction to these
                        changes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I said earlier that, in the first place, my wife has always been completely
                    supportive in terms of putting up with long hours, travel, and missing important
                    events. She always felt that it was important for the country and for me
                    personally to be engaged in public affairs and to work hard. She felt personally
                    that I had a contribution to make.</p>
                <p>Secondly, by the same token she understood my own desire and recognized my need,
                    to a certain extent, to take breaks and return to work later on. She welcomed
                    that as well. She certainly never urged me to stay on at work when I felt the
                    need to get out. Conversely, however, she was quite strong, keeping me in
                    service at least temporarily, when I felt the need to get out of government
                    service. For example, when I was getting restless over the long hours I was
                    spending, the pressure, and the way Henry Kissinger sometimes treated me. Or
                    when I was close to resigning over the incursion into Cambodia in the spring of
                    1970. She was the one who kept me in government service. Previous to that, she
                    encouraged me to become Kissinger's Special Assistant, although I knew that the
                    hours I would be spending in that job would be horrendous. She always wanted me
                    to work hard but also to take breaks for the reasons I cited.</p>
                <p>Q: How did she feel, particularly about your returning to government service
                    after being out of the government for three months? Then you returned.</p>
                <p>LORD: She was very much in favor of my returning to work. She felt, once again,
                    that Kissinger was an exciting person to work with and that this was a big
                    chance for me. I had a three month break. She felt that it was time for me to
                    get back to work, so that was no problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0444" n="Page0444"/>
                <p>The next time I left government service was in January, 1977, when President
                    Carter came in to replace President Ford. Kissinger and the rest of us left
                    government service. As far as my kids were concerned at that point, my daughter
                    was 12, and my son was nine years old. That was the main reason that I wanted to
                    leave, to see more of them, as well as the other reasons I mentioned. So we
                    picked up and went out to Colorado. We wanted to get away and spend some time in
                    the mountains for roughly a year. We didn't have any specific time table. We
                    drove around the country looking at various places. I won't go into any great
                    detail. Our itinerary wasn't of any particular significance. We found a place
                    near Boulder, Colorado, up in the mountains, on a ranch. It was a gorgeous
                    setting. We spent nine months out there. It turned out that this was the least
                    amount of snow that they had ever had in the winter. This affected our skiing.
                    In any event, I did a lot of reading, stayed somewhat in touch with Washington,
                    but not in any great detail. I submitted some ideas to Kissinger and reminded
                    him of some anecdotes which he might want to use in his memoirs. Basically, I
                    just read, got back into good physical shape, and had a very pleasant time.</p>
                <p>My wife was writing her first novel at that time, “Spring Moon.” This was her
                    second book. Then we got a call from the Council on Foreign Relations. They were
                    looking for a new President. As soon as I had left government service, I had
                    already been approached by the previous President of the Council, a man named
                    Bay Manning. He asked me if I would be the Director of Studies at the Council. I
                    turned that offer down. Then I was asked if I would consider being named
                    President of the Council, to replace Manning. To make a long story short, I said
                    that I would be willing to be considered. I went back to New York, was
                    interviewed, and in the course of the summer of 1977, I was selected by the
                    Council to be the President. I held that job from September, 1977, until I was
                    appointed by President Reagan to be Ambassador to China in the summer of 1985. I
                    left the Council although, thanks to Senator Jesse Helms [Republican, North
                    Carolina], I was not confirmed by the Senate and able to travel to China until
                    November, 1985.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's see. You left the Office of Policy Planning in 1977,
                        yohad a year off...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Roughly, from January, 1977, to September, 1977, when I started work for
                    the Council on Foreign Relations. So I had roughly eight months off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were out of government service from September,
                        1977, untiNovember, 1985.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I worked for the Council from 1977 until 1985.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you explain what the Council on Foreign Relations was
                        at thatime and its role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0445" n="Page0445"/>
                <p>LORD: The Council on Foreign Relations was originally set up in the 1920s to help
                    to educate the American elite and, through them, the American public of the need
                    for American engagement in the world. You will recall that, after World War I,
                    we had begun to retreat into isolationism once again. This has been a continuing
                    pattern in our history. That was the original impetus for the establishment of
                    the Council. Its membership, in its early decades, was composed almost entirely
                    of residents of New York. However, they had different points of view, from
                    liberal to conservative. They came from different professions, including
                    banking, law, business, journalism, former government officials, or religious or
                    scientific leaders. The common thread uniting them was an interest in foreign
                    affairs. The Council also publishes a magazine, “Foreign Affairs,” and has a
                    tradition of sponsoring off the record meetings for members only.</p>
                <p>It also sponsored study programs for scholars, who would do work that would
                    inform the public debate on foreign affairs and even help to advise the
                    government in Washington.</p>
                <p>In its early years, and particularly during the early, Cold War period the
                    Council was very influential with the federal government. In fact, it
                    participated in some joint work and studies with the Department of State during
                    the late 1940s. Enough of its members were drawn from the American elite that
                    people chosen for federal government positions in the foreign affairs area had
                    often been active members of the Council. That practice has continued to this
                    day. Members of the Council have been chosen for government positions, not
                    because they are members of the Council but because they have an interest or
                    accomplishments in the international field. The chances are that people with
                    such interests would join the Council on Foreign Relations. This has given rise
                    to a lot of conspiracy theories about the Council allegedly running American
                    foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is, they are supposedly members of the East
                        Coasestablishment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. For many years the Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations was
                    John McCloy. When I was there, the Chairman was David Rockefeller. Now the
                    Chairman is Pete Peterson. Most Americans who have excelled in foreign policy
                    matters at one time or another have been members of the Council.</p>
                <p>By the time I became President of the Council in 1977, many more think tanks, of
                    course, had been established, not only in New York but increasingly in
                    Washington, DC, as well, in addition to others in other places throughout the
                    country. There was much more competition. The Council was therefore certainly
                    not the only game in town. It clearly did not have the kind of preeminent
                    position which it had before and it did not have the immediate impact on
                    government policy which it had when it was literally working jointly with the
                    government on some studies.</p>
                <pb facs="0446" n="Page0446"/>
                <p>When I went to work for the Council, I had several objectives. I figured that we
                    had to continue to play the Council's strong suit and traditions, even when we
                    had to adapt to the new foreign policy agenda and to the fact that we had much
                    more competition in the think tank field.So I set about to do several things. I
                    won't go into too much detail. It would be self-serving and would not be
                    particularly relevant to this discussion. I wished to have policy impact. I
                    wanted to expand the membership of the Council to include greater diversity of
                    background, both in terms of having more women members as well as people from
                    minority groups. Also, frankly, there was somewhat of a tilt in the Council to
                    the liberal side, although we had a variety of people. I wanted to bring in a
                    lot more outstanding conservatives and try to get more Congressmen and Senators.
                    Above all, I wanted to have more of a national reach, not only in Washington but
                    across the country. In the early years of the Council, the East Coast
                    establishment had an Atlantic, European orientation. I thought that the Council
                    had to be more national in outlook, as well as more diverse, as I mentioned, in
                    terms of sex, as well as ethnic background. We needed this geographic diversity.
                    I also wanted younger members. I expanded our term members, that is, temporary
                    younger members, who might later become full members, in addition to looking for
                    younger, permanent members. These membership goals was one effort I
                    undertook.</p>
                <p>Another effort was in enhancing the meetings programs, at which we would have
                    more debates and more interesting formats. I also arranged to have occasional
                    meetings on the record, and not just for the members. If a Secretary of State or
                    even the President wanted to give a speech, if he came to the Council, he could
                    only give it off the record to perhaps 200 people or so. This wouldn't attract
                    many speakers. Allowing wider distribution of remarks provided an opportunity to
                    give major speeches. Then there would often be a question and answer period off
                    the record, so that members would get something special. I didn't want to lose
                    out on a chance of affecting a broad audience and attracting a lot of people to
                    come. One of our strengths, of course, was that, because of the influence and
                    expertise of the audience, we could attract good speakers, both foreigners and
                    Americans, who would want to speak before that group, even if it was off the
                    record. This normal rule was to encourage candor. So under these still usual
                    guidelines, they could reach an elite audience, although it was not a major,
                    public affairs event. Other foreign affairs organizations play that public role
                    well. I didn't feel that we could arrange to have the Council serve the public
                    exclusively, or even primarily. Other groups were doing that, and if we did
                    this, we would risk losing our special strength. However, I did want the Council
                    to have a broader impact than we had, so I sought a balance.</p>
                <p>Occasionally, I would allow C-Span [TV channel] or some other TV channel to use
                    our facilities. However, I did this rarely, because I didn't want to upset the
                    tradition of having candid, off the record discussions. I wanted us to give the
                    members something that the public wouldn't have, aiming in this way to influence
                    public opinion by working through the elite.</p>
                <pb facs="0447" n="Page0447"/>
                <p>I put a lot of emphasis on the national reach of the Council, not just in the
                    membership. We scheduled activities around the country, whether these involved
                    conferences or just regular meetings of a dinner-working group type or study
                    groups in selected cities around the country. We also had about 35 or 40
                    committees affiliated with us in various parts of the country, in large and
                    small cities. There might be only one a few Council members on these committees,
                    but they were leaders of their communities on foreign policy matters. I visited
                    all of them. The idea there was to extend our national reach by working with
                    them. We would leave them completely independent on foreign policy matters, as
                    they should be.</p>
                <p>Moreover, we greatly expanded a fledgling presence in Washington, substantially
                    increasing our membership and activities there. After all, this was the key city
                    for direct policy impact.</p>
                <p>I would also work with the editor of the Council's quarterly publication,
                    “Foreign Affairs,” first William P. Bundy, who was succeeded by Bill Hyland, to
                    exchange ideas on what might be done. One idea I had was to have an annual issue
                    of “Foreign Affairs” which would review the year in foreign policy terms. I
                    recalled what we had done with President Nixon's annual report on foreign
                    policy. I thought it was useful to have articles reviewing the year in various
                    regions of the world on various issues.</p>
                <p>In addition, I worked hard to help the financial situation of the Council. We
                    increased the annual contributions from the members. We substantially expanded
                    our Corporate Program, in terms of members, contributions, and activities - some
                    for it alone, some jointly with individual Council members. We secured some
                    foundation grants for projects. And we tripled the Council's endowment. We not
                    only achieved a younger, more national and diversified membership, along the
                    lines that I have mentioned, we also stimulated greater participation by the
                    members - in fact doubled - using new settings and formats in the meetings and
                    studies programs. We greatly expanded our program in Washington, DC, which had
                    just begun, making it a second center for the Council, in terms of meetings and
                    members. We also sought to beef up the studies program in terms of resident and
                    visiting fellows and shorter more readable papers as well as books. This was not
                    as successful in terms of its impact as I had hoped that it would be. I sought
                    to attract people to New York and pay them appropriate salaries. We emphasized
                    shorter publications, rather than long books, and increasing the number of
                    visiting and international fellows, working in the Council. As I said, we also
                    had a year end issue of “Foreign Affairs,” worked with the regional committees
                    and increased our corporate program, which raised money but also got members
                    more involved in Council activities. We sponsored many more regional events and
                    activities and recruited additional members. We encouraged them to develop their
                    activities and raise additional funds. The annual revenue from gifts and
                    contributions was tripled. About half of the members of the Council were now
                    contributing on an annual basis. We sponsored a special, fund-raising program
                    for the Council, which raised close to $15 million. We tripled our endowment
                    from $10 to $31 million, which was quite significant in those days.</p>
                <pb facs="0448" n="Page0448"/>
                <p>We also acquired a couple of brownstone buildings next to the Council, which has
                    allowed the Council to expand ever since. We put computers in. We generally
                    tried to revive the Council, because I thought that it was suffering somewhat,
                    not only from competition but also from a lack of energy and morale. These are
                    some of the things that we tried to do.</p>
                <p>Now, more philosophically, which is a matter of greater interest to this project,
                    in general outsiders can be helpful to the federal government. I've seen both
                    sides of this, both when I was in the government and outside it. The chances are
                    that outsiders are most helpful in terms of ideas on middle term problems. If an
                    issue is too long term, just like in policy planning within the government, it
                    may not be of great, immediate concern to policy makers who are concerned about
                    getting things done and reducing the size of their in boxes over the next couple
                    of years.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, if you're outside the government and try to provide tactical
                    advice on a day to day basis and you don't have classified information
                    available, you don't have the operational experience to give the nuances
                    affecting issues. It's very hard for a member of a think tank, or anyone else
                    outside the government, to give policy makers day to day, tactical advice.</p>
                <p>So the basic horizons where outsiders can be helpful involve middle term matters,
                    that is, matters which are coming up the next year or two, for example. This is
                    not unlike what policy planning tries to do within the Department of State. You
                    try to look ahead at issues and sketch things out.</p>
                <p>That's generally where your focus is, as opposed to academic or ivory tower
                    exercises or the provision of tactical advice. Having said that, we tried to
                    influence the ongoing policy debate because we wanted to have some impact and
                    prestige for the Council. This is, of course, difficult to quantify.</p>
                <p>One way to do that is to have speakers ranging from the President and cabinet
                    officials, down to Assistant Secretaries of State, or even below that level, to
                    come and speak to the Council, whether in New York, Washington, or elsewhere
                    around the country. They get a chance to present their views to a very important
                    audience and their comments can be rather candid in terms of the off-the-record,
                    non-attribution roles. There is also the matter of the questions that they get;
                    these officials can pick up the mood of the foreign policy elite in this way.
                    From these encounters they may learn that they may be running into trouble in
                    terms of a policy that is not understood or which people disagree with.</p>
                <p>These meetings can be very useful in this manner which cannot be quantified.
                    Members of the Council can have some impact on the policy makers in this sense.
                    And policy makers can impress their views - and their persona - upon important
                    audiences.</p>
                <pb facs="0449" n="Page0449"/>
                <p>In addition, there are study programs conducted by a small group which meet six
                    or eight times a year, involving 15 or 20 people who are experts on a subject.
                    They have different points of view and come from different backgrounds or
                    professions. They may be working on a manuscript which someone is getting their
                    advice on or they may produce a paper of their own. You can involve policy
                    makers in such groups as well, to make sure that you have the administration's
                    viewpoint but also to influence them in the give and take, and any written
                    results.</p>
                <p>Then, of course articles published in “Foreign Affairs” can provide support or
                    critique or raise new issues and have some impact on the national debate and
                    even on policy making. It is impossible to quantify this, and it shouldn't be
                    exaggerated. However, together with all of the other think tanks in operation,
                    not to mention the Op Ed articles in the media in the country, the magazine
                    provides a milieu of ideas together with other activities that help shape the
                    environment within which the policy makers have to operate. They can take some
                    ideas from all these sources, adjust policies which they think are running into
                    real problems, step up educational efforts to gain public support, learn fresh
                    perspectives, etc.So I think that organizations like the Council on Foreign
                    Relations can and do play an important role. It shouldn't be exaggerated, but
                    it's important.</p>
                <p>Let me make a couple of other, quick points in answer to your question. The
                    Council can also be helpful because the Council and other think tanks in Boston,
                    New York, and elsewhere are often places where people who leave government
                    service come and work, study, give their views, and write their memoirs. Then
                    the latter in turn then help inform the debate and study in the think tanks, but
                    recharge the intellectual batteries of individual members. They may go back into
                    government service in the next administration, depending on which political
                    party is in power. That's of some use. That is to get people who have been
                    involved in policy making to give them a chance to think and write, and then to
                    go back into government, recharged and refreshed.</p>
                <p>Also you have other people who come into the Council or other think tanks in the
                    case of groups which are membership organizations. They are educated by going to
                    the meetings, hearing various speakers, or participating in study groups. In
                    this way their capacities can be strengthened. Some day, they may go into
                    government service and help in that way.</p>
                <p>These are some of the ways in which the think tanks can be helpful ithe making of
                    U.S. foreign policy.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that the Council on Foreign Relations was active as a sort of
                    shadow government? The American Heritage Foundation serves this function for the
                    conservatives, and the Brookings Institution does this for the democratic side
                    of the political spectrum. They provide places where people can hang around and
                    do their thing until their turn comes up again in terms of the political
                    pendulum. Did the Council play that kind of role?</p>
                <pb facs="0450" n="Page0450"/>
                <p>LORD: Not as much as some of the examples which you cited, which I think are fair
                    examples. In the first place, we have the advantage and the disadvantage of not
                    having an ideological stance. The American Heritage Foundation and the American
                    Enterprise Institute are generally regarded as conservative operations. The
                    Brookings Institution used to be seen as a more liberal organization but is not
                    regarded as particularly liberal at present. There are other think tanks which
                    are considered to have one orientation or another. Often, as you say, these
                    organizations are regarded as something like revolving doors. In many ways
                    Brookings might flourish more when the Republicans are in office and the more
                    conservative organizations when the Democrats are in office because they have
                    more people to work with, their best people aren't in government service.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, you get more attention when you are critical and give advice which
                    runs counter to policy, rather than supporting it. That is somewhat
                    oversimplified, even for these institutions.</p>
                <p>However, these considerations don't really apply to the Council on Foreign
                    Relations because we were so impeccably diverse that we could not be identified
                    as being liberal or conservative. For years some conservatives were somewhat
                    suspicious of the Council because they considered us as liberal on the whole. I
                    made an effort to get more conservatives into the Council for that very reason,
                    as well as to ensure debate. There are some extreme groups, right and left, who
                    exaggerate the Council's influence and allege we control government policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go about getting more conservatives into the
                        Council?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I thought of outstanding Congressmen and Senators, military types, or think
                    tank people and journalists who were elsewhere conservative. I would go to
                    mutual friends and ask them to seek people out who might be interested in
                    joining the Council. Not that I could determine membership. I would also ask my
                    colleagues on the staff and Board for suggestions. I made a conscious effort,
                    working with conservatives who were already members of the Council to get more
                    conservatives, because we needed some additional balance in the Council. As a
                    result of this effort, we did get some additional conservatives. Even a few
                    prominent conservatives really help you when you can say, and these are not
                    necessarily people who joined the Council during my tenure as President, “We've
                    got Jeanne Kirkpatrick, we've got George Will, we've got Bill Buckley.”</p>
                <pb facs="0451" n="Page0451"/>
                <p>Beyond that, for intellectual reasons, I sought more balance. Also, as I said,
                    the Council is a membership organization. There are now a few thousand members.
                    These other think tanks consist more of scholars than regular members. So, given
                    our diversity and our impeccable non-partisanship, we don't have the
                    disadvantage of looking biased. We also don't have the advantage of having as
                    much direct impact, like the Heritage Foundation or the American Enterprise
                    Institute, which do a lot of studies and send people into the government. When
                    Ronald Reagan came into office as President, you could see the impact of what
                    these other think tanks had been up to. The Council on Foreign Relations is more
                    diverse. This has certain advantages in terms of attracting people who want to
                    speak to and get diverse points, thus this big tent includes a broad spectrum
                    that at times may have less focus and power.</p>
                <p>Q: Also, I think that one of the nice things about being a foundation with an
                    attitude is that you can attract money from people who have similar
                    attitudes.</p>
                <p>LORD: That's a very good point. I made a big effort, and with some success, to
                    increase our fund-raising and our endowment through annual giving and our
                    corporate giving programs. However, there is no question that people who have a
                    strong, ideological bias and have some money behind them, are likely to support
                    an organization which agrees with their aims. That is absolutely an
                    advantage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your headquarters were in New York, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Headquarters were and are in New York, but I opened a sort of second
                    headquarters in Washington, DC, which has expanded since then. I made a major
                    effort in this regard. Then we would work with these committees around the
                    country. We tried to build up particular concentrations in a few cities for
                    actual Council activities. Sometimes these were in conjunction with a local
                    committee, sometimes on their own. So we were realistic. We didn't try to spread
                    ourselves all over. It took a while to get enough members to build up a critical
                    mass in particular areas. We worked, for example, on Los Angeles, San Francisco,
                    Houston, and Minneapolis. There already was a Council on Foreign Relations in
                    Chicago, which was not related to us. So we didn't try to do as much there.</p>
                <p>We would have meetings, conferences, and study groups. We just got this ball
                    rolling. The program has been expanded since then. Now they have the advantage
                    of video conferencing and other things that can be done. Previously, our problem
                    had been that if we got more members across the country, how could we make
                    affiliation with the Council meaningful for them if they were living in
                    California when most of the activity was in New York or Washington. We made it
                    clear that they could come to any meeting, no matter how small, whenever they
                    were in New York or Washington. We would send out newsletters and events
                    calendars to keep them better posted. We would bring out study groups or
                    organize conferences in their area to give them a sense of involvement in the
                    activities of the Council.</p>
                <pb facs="0452" n="Page0452"/>
                <p>We made a modest beginning in these various respects, and we greatly expanded our
                    activities in Washington, DC. A lot more has been done since then. The Internet,
                    webcasting, video conferencing, etc. all help a great deal to reach members
                    across the country.</p>
                <p>Q: I would think that one of the groups that you would want to reach, even if
                    they did not have enough money to belong to the Council, would be the academic
                    community and student groups.</p>
                <p>LORD: We had lots of leading academics in our membership. The way we handled
                    membership dues was that people would pay more for their membership if they
                    lived in New York. If they lived in Washington, they would pay less than New
                    York but more than anywhere else in the country. Secondly, the older a member
                    gets, the more he or she will pay. Thirdly, if they were business members, they
                    would pay more than if they were not business members but were academics,
                    journalists, or government officials. So we had a sliding scale of dues to make
                    this more manageable for younger, academic, and geographically diverse members.
                    Dues would be higher for businessmen, lawyers, New Yorkers, and older people,
                    which seemed to make sense.</p>
                <p>Membership in the Council was a very good deal, because in those days the cost of
                    membership might range from $50-100 annually for a young person, or an academic
                    in California, to, maybe $300-400 for a middle aged businessman in New York. In
                    return for your membership dues, you received a subscription to “Foreign
                    Affairs” magazine. Secondly, you were entitled to attend a whole menu of
                    meetings, conferences, study groups, including meals. It was obviously easier to
                    take advantage of this if you lived on the East Coast. There were advantageous
                    prices for publications, books, and studies which we would turn out. If you were
                    in New York or Washington and just went to about 10 or 20 meetings, at which
                    lunch was free of charge, you would get your money back just in terms of the
                    meals.</p>
                <p>An important program at the Council was the International Affairs Fellows. Most
                    of these were future leaders, in their 30s and 40s. We would recruit scholars
                    and place them in government service for a year. We would take government
                    officials and place them in academic communities, the Council, another think
                    tank. In this way government employees got a chance to get out, recharge their
                    batteries, think, write, and be exposed to Council activities. Then they would
                    go back refreshed and with a different perspective. The academics and others on
                    the outside would go into government service, get a sense of what it's really
                    like to make policy and to work in Washington. Then, for example, they could go
                    back and be a teacher or writer who would have a better sense for policy and not
                    just academic, conceptual theory. This has been a very successful program. We
                    would place people in the Department of State, the White House, the Department
                    of Defense, CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], and so on. Conversely, we would
                    place people at Harvard University, the Council on Foreign Relations, or some
                    university out West, for example, at the same time.</p>
                <pb facs="0453" n="Page0453"/>
                <p>The way we got more young people, in addition to trying to get people in their
                    30s and 40s into the Council was to expand our term membership program. It's
                    hard to get people in their late 20s or early 30s to compete with other
                    membership applicants in terms of a resume. It's tough to get in the Council,
                    through the Membership Committee and the Board, in competition with someone who
                    is in their 50s or 60s.</p>
                <p>Membership in the Council is for life, unless you fail to pay your dues or do
                    something unbelievably outrageous - or resign because of a lack of interest.
                    Therefore, every year, everyone is getting a year older, so you constantly have
                    the question of keeping the age profiles younger. One way to handle that is to
                    have term members. They are not lifetime members, so you're not committing
                    yourself for all time to someone who has a lesser resume. They, in turn, are not
                    committing themselves for a long time. Term members are in their late 20s or
                    early 30s and join the Council for five years. They have full privileges. After
                    five years, they cannot rejoin the Council for one year. They examine whether
                    they wish to continue as members of the Council. The Council, having seen how
                    they performed during those five years, determines whether they should be
                    elected to full membership. Therefore, you have a constant pool of people who
                    are in their early or mid-30s who can be drawn upon to be full members.I feel
                    pretty good about my years as President of the Council. I knew that the Council
                    had been drifting. This may sound self-serving. When I spoke at my first meeting
                    with the Board, I was very blunt about the situation and outlined multiyear
                    goals. I think that we invigorated the Council and set some new directions by
                    the time I left. Many of these changes have been implemented very successfully
                    and on a broader basis since then, by the present President, Les Gelb, who has
                    done a really good job.</p>
                <p>There was one painful episode which is worth putting in here, involving Henry
                    Kissinger. In getting this job of President of the Council on Foreign Relations
                    I had the feeling that some of the directors on the board felt that I was just a
                    Kissinger representative, as it were, and that I didn't stand for myself. I
                    considered it a plus to be close to Kissinger. I believe some people hesitated
                    about this before I was appointed President of the Council. In the event I had
                    no problems with the board. I worked closely with them and found ways to get
                    them involved in the work of the Council. I made our board meetings more
                    interesting by having substantive discussions among the directors, instead of
                    just doing business.</p>
                <p>In connection with the election of directors, it was a bit painful because we had
                    a system then under which you had to get people to agree to run for positions on
                    the board and, of course, their egos are hurt if they run for positions on the
                    board but are not elected to it. There's always a matter of your wanting to have
                    diversity on the board, including such considerations as gender, youth,
                    geography, profession, and ideology. However, you couldn't always engineer that
                    in elections to the board by the membership. Very often the best known among
                    candidates were not young or female or minority members. Since that time we've
                    moved to a mixture of appointing and democratically electing members of the
                    board.</p>
                <pb facs="0454" n="Page0454"/>
                <p>At the time of which I speak, we had a system under which we had only so many
                    vacancies. We had a couple of more people nominated than those to be elected.In
                    one year, and I forget the exact numbers, but let's say that there were,
                    perhaps, five vacancies and six candidates. One of the candidates was Kissinger.
                    This was a crazy system because only one of the candidates was going to lose.
                    The way it worked was that you had to vote for five out of six candidates. Henry
                    Kissinger was clearly the most qualified of anybody to be a director. On the
                    other hand, he had made enemies, as any strong person would. He, more than any
                    of the other five candidates, was going to pick up some negative votes. There
                    were relatively more people who didn't like Kissinger, either personally or
                    ideologically, even though those who voted for him overwhelmingly would have put
                    all of their votes behind him. By definition, someone who had the highest
                    profile attracted the most opposition. This reminds me of the Chinese saying
                    that the tallest tree attracts the most lightning.</p>
                <p>To make a long story short, here was a former Secretary of State, one of our most
                    distinguished diplomats, losing the election to the board of the Council on
                    Foreign Relations. This really caused a strain on our personal relationship. The
                    Council had a crazy system for electing members of the board. Kissinger thought
                    that he had been humiliated by not being elected to the board. He was absolutely
                    right in this respect. I was nervous about the election because I could see this
                    situation shaping up. I hoped that Kissinger would somehow squeeze in. In the
                    event, he lost out for the reasons that I mentioned. Although Kissinger probably
                    got 85% of the vote, those elected probably got 86% or 87% of the vote. There
                    was probably more orchestration of anti-Kissinger votes by his critics. That is,
                    five out of six votes. Kissinger almost resigned from the Council as a result of
                    this outcome. It was a most painful episode for me, because Kissinger was a
                    personal friend of mine, and he also suffered the humiliation that went on with
                    articles in the newspapers and so forth about the defeat of his candidacy to be
                    a member of the board. I'll never forget this episode.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the Western versus the Eastern slant? In other words, Asia versus
                    Europe. Was that a problem for you, as you are a New Yorker?</p>
                <p>LORD: It was not a problem, although one of the reasons that I wanted to get out
                    beyond New York and Washington was to reflect viewpoints around the country,
                    just generally in the approach to foreign policy. I also wanted to reflect the
                    greater strength and importance of the West, for example, as well as the South
                    in our foreign policy. This included the fact that the areas outside of New York
                    and Washington would be looking more out across the Pacific and toward our
                    Southern neighbors. We had a Eurocentric background. The Council on Foreign
                    Relations was traditionally heavily European in emphasis, as was American
                    foreign policy. So I was consciously trying to broaden our orientation, not only
                    for geographic and diversity reasons but also for foreign policy reasons as
                    well. We wanted to look to other areas in addition to Europe. We would try to
                    look hard at Texas because we knew that Mexican and Latin American issues would
                    be important. Yes, that was part of our strategy.</p>
                <pb facs="0455" n="Page0455"/>
                <p>In the 1970s the importance of Asia was not as dramatic then as it has been in
                    the past decade, with its phenomenal economic growth and all of the other issues
                    which have involved it. Not to mention the fact that more Asian-Americans have
                    come into our society, as well as the shift of our population toward the West
                    Coast and the Pacific Ocean area, as well as the South. All of this has meant
                    that Asia is more important. This was a theme which I stressed when I became
                    Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. I worked to get Asia up
                    on the agenda, for example, making APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Conference] a
                    summit and the region hosting President Clinton's first trip abroad. Our trade
                    patterns, our security interests, and our immigration patterns have made
                    Asia/Pacific increasingly important. These patterns were not so pronounced in
                    the 1970s.</p>
                <p>Q: In dealing with this subject, how did you find a matter which is very
                    difficult for us to handle in the United States, and particularly in New York?
                    That is, the Arab-Israeli situation.</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, obviously like any other issue, we had to deal with a tremendous
                    diversity of members and viewpoints. In New York you have a lot of people who
                    are pro-Israeli. There were plenty of members, particularly from other parts of
                    the country, who took a global view. There were people in Washington and
                    elsewhere who were very interested in energy questions and Arab interests. That
                    was never a problem. I never faced any pressures, either on that or on any other
                    issue, to be biased one way or another. I wouldn't have stood for this. It would
                    have been against the traditions of the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
                <p>We had very good debates. Of course, we had speakers and papers of all kinds. I
                    made it a point, as we always have in the Council, to have all points of view
                    presented, not only in our studies but also in the speeches made at our
                    meetings. That presents a certain disadvantage in terms of impact, versus
                    conservative or liberal think tanks. The Council on Foreign Relations is more of
                    a neutral platform, which can mean that we have less influence. We have to rely
                    on individual articles in “Foreign Affairs” and books or, perhaps, a
                    recommendation of one of our study groups and the impact of questions and
                    answers at meetings. We don't exercise the kind of pressure that other think
                    tanks have. On Arab-Israeli issues, we had all points of view presented and
                    debated. We had the same approach in our publications.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find the influence of “Foreign Affairs” magazine while you were
                    President of the Council? During my 30 years in the Foreign Service, “Foreign
                    Affairs” magazine has always been around, and I have looked at individual issues
                    from time to time. However, I wasn't a regular reader of it, and most of my
                    colleagues also were not regular readers. I am much more interested in “Foreign
                    Affairs” now than when I was a serving diplomat.</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, it is hard to quantify. There have been individual articles, of
                    course, in “Foreign Affairs” which have had a major impact. The single most
                    famous was George Kennan's article, signed “X,” on containment of the Soviet
                    Union [and carried in the magazine in 1947]. There have been other
                    articles...</p>
                <pb facs="0456" n="Page0456"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Henry Kissinger and Jeanne Kirkpatrick made their marks
                        witarticles in “Foreign Affairs.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's right. Actually, Kissinger first made his mark for the Council on
                    Foreign Relations in a study group publication which was turned into a book,
                    “Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy.” He's written some articles which have
                    drawn attention in foreign affairs. Richard Nixon wrote a famous article in 1967
                    about Asia, including China, which foreshadowed his interest in having a more
                    open and normal relationship with China. This was foreshadowed in that article.
                    There have been other, major articles, sometimes not so famous, but they were
                    out ahead of the power curve. They influenced people's discussion and attention
                    on some new issues.</p>
                <p>There's no question that for much of its history, and until recently, “Foreign
                    Affairs” generally relied on fairly long articles which were not always easy
                    reading. This meant that, in some cases, they had major impact, like the article
                    by “X.” It also meant that many people in government, including people very
                    interested in foreign policy, found these articles a little reader unfriendly.
                    They would be coffee table material.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I saw an awful lot of copies of issues of “Foreign
                        Affairs” ocoffee tables.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: During my period as President of the Council we made an effort to try and
                    make “Foreign Affairs” a little more lively, to try to make sure that some
                    younger, less well-known authors were included, that newer issues were
                    addressed, and that some shorter articles appeared in it. We also instituted
                    this year end review of foreign affairs, which I think was used, particularly on
                    college campuses, as a tool for teaching in college, as well as for people
                    generally reviewing the scene.In the last few years the Council has made a major
                    effort, and with some success, to make the material in the magazine much more
                    accessible. This has been done by including shorter articles, essays as well as
                    commentaries, more lively graphics, and having a more friendly format.
                    Hopefully, these changes did not lose, as some would charge, although I would
                    not, the gravitas and tradition of “Foreign Affairs.” It has a sufficiently
                    recognizable cover and style, so that you don't forget that it is “Foreign
                    Affairs” and is not “Playboy” magazine. It now contains shorter and spiffier
                    articles that people can relate to. It comes out a little more often, six times
                    a year, versus four times a year as it previously did.</p>
                <pb facs="0457" n="Page0457"/>
                <p>Now, there has been some criticism that “Foreign Affairs” is losing its unique
                    qualities, that it is a little trendy, and that it is light on foreign affairs.
                    It is said that the magazine no longer has the gravitas of articles like that by
                    “X” in 1947. I think that one could introduce a couple of those more serious
                    articles per issue, in addition to the shorter pieces. In terms of influence,
                    there have been individual articles, as I say, but it is very hard to claim that
                    “Foreign Affairs” is a major influence. Having said that, I would add that if
                    someone wants to write an article, and certainly this applies to my time as
                    President of the Council, as well as today, and particularly in my time and
                    before my time, if they want to write a serious foreign policy article and gain
                    attention, they still have to come to “Foreign Affairs,” which has the widest
                    circulation of publications of its type. We got the circulation up over 100,000
                    copies during my time at the Council, which isn't bad for a professional
                    magazine like that. The circulation is even higher now.</p>
                <p>Even though harassed policy makers aren't necessarily reading it, the chances are
                    that key columnists and other people from think tanks and foreigners are looking
                    at it. Chances are that, although most policy makers don't read the magazine as
                    a whole, they'll read one or two articles. So it still is something that is
                    sought after. There was much more competition for “Foreign Affairs” in my day
                    and even more now than there used to be. Now, in addition, you have competition
                    from all-news channels, cable TV, and commentaries in so many different
                    magazines, which provide even further competition. “Foreign Affairs” is still
                    the flagship of the Council on Foreign Relations, and most people have heard of
                    it. I would agree that people often didn't read it as much as they bought it.
                    However, there are exceptions to that, and there still are.</p>
                <p>Q: Was “Foreign Affairs” a natural publication for the academic community to
                    read, or did you make an effort to ensure that it didn't become overly
                    academic?</p>
                <p>LORD: The Council?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I meant the magazine, “Foreign Affairs.” Also, I mean, the
                        wholrange of Council activities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: The whole purpose of the Council was and is to try to bridge the
                    thoughtfulness of the academic world and the relevance of the policy and
                    professional worlds. So while we didn't become too much imbued with an ivory
                    tower mentality we had some conceptual and outside thinking that was more than
                    just technical, day to day, policy making. I want to make clear that the
                    magazine was independent of the Council. I had a very good relationship with
                    both Bill Bundy and Bill Hyland, the two editors while I was president.</p>
                <pb facs="0458" n="Page0458"/>
                <p>I never tried to exert any influence on the publication. What I did, from time to
                    time, was to make suggestions on issues which, I thought, might make interesting
                    articles. People from “Foreign Affairs” would often come to me and ask my views
                    on specific questions, particularly on China. That is, they would ask whether
                    something was worth publishing or might even ask that I make editing changes in
                    a given article. I was very careful just to offer ideas, but they had to make
                    the decisions. Like the year-end issue - I would make suggestions and then they
                    would decide whether to adopt or change them.</p>
                <p>However, whatever success or lack thereof which we had during my tenure as
                    President of the Council with the publication, “Foreign Affairs,” or anyone
                    else's tenure, was the work of the editor, and not that of the President of the
                    Council. To give you an example of independence, David Rockefeller was Chairman
                    of the Board of the Council - I should underline his general influence and, for
                    the Council and our excellent working relations, prestige. He wrote an article
                    on international economic affairs and submitted it to Bill Bundy, the editor of
                    “Foreign Affairs.” Bundy rejected it. And here Rockefeller was Chairman of the
                    Board! He was a classy person who was naturally disappointed, but he fully
                    understood the situation and didn't try to put any pressure on anybody. So that
                    is a classic example of independence, if I ever saw it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that we've talked about this before, but did you
                        sort okeep your policy credentials polished?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, I did. First, of course, in terms of my intellectual capabilities, I
                    went to many of these meetings and study groups. I felt that I should keep on
                    top of things as well as showing the flag as president of the organization. At
                    that point in my career in the 1970s and 1980s, I was still a global expert. I
                    had been director of Policy Planning and a Special Assistant on particular
                    issues during my Foreign Service, Department of Defense, and NSC assignments.
                    Even though I had done a lot of work on China and Vietnam, my perspective was
                    still global. The Council on Foreign Relations was global, and this was all very
                    good in terms of continuing the development of my perspective. I had a lot of
                    friends in government during the Carter administration. Then I was also at the
                    Council for the first few years of the Reagan administration. I kept in touch
                    with these friends. In some cases, particularly on China, they would ask my
                    advice or I would consult with them. I wrote a few op ed pieces.</p>

                <p>I didn't have any strategic aims in terms of career goals. I never had them in my
                    life. I felt that I wanted to return to government service some day but I didn't
                    organize my whole life around the theme of, How can I pull this off? I spent
                    about seven and one-half years with the Council. After about five to six years
                    there I was ready, as I have been in any job, to move on. I also felt that I had
                    accomplished pretty much what I could at the Council and that it was time for
                    new blood to replace me. I was beginning to do things every year that I had done
                    the year before, and I risked losing my enthusiasm and drive, which I think is
                    only natural. So I was receptive to returning to government service. I had
                    always been a moderate, liberal Republican, so I didn't think that I would get
                    an appointment from the Reagan administration.</p>
                <p>I think I've described how I got the assignment as Ambassador to China. Both
                    President and Mrs. Reagan were impressed with the briefing on China which my
                    wife and I gave them at a White House lunch before they visited China in 1984.
                    She also liked Bette's book “Spring Moon.” Secretary of State George Shultz had
                    been a director of the Council and NSC Advisor Bud McFarlane knew me from the
                    Ford days. Reagan knew of my having worked with Kissinger on China. I was
                    invited by the Reagans to attend a number of social events.</p>
                <p>Naturally, I tried to keep up my intellectual abilities. This was natural with
                    the job, in terms of foreign policy, as well as visibility through occasional
                    articles I wrote and trips I made around the country to visit our committees and
                    speak elsewhere. I would stay in touch with Washington and so on. I was just
                    generally interested in foreign policy and had no specific game plan. I had a
                    desire to go back into government service at that point, unlike now, when I no
                    longer have that desire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else that we should cover?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: There are just a couple of things. I also got involved in some other
                    organizations while I was President of the Council, partly for my own exposure
                    and to learn and partly out of interest. In part, it was good for the Council
                    for its President to be a member of other organizations.</p>
                <p>For example, I became a member of the Trilateral Commission, which is an
                    organization started by David Rockefeller, along with Zbig Brzezinski, in the
                    1970s to coordinate policies among the industrial democracies. That is, Western
                    Europe, Japan, the U.S., and Canada. Since leaving government service again in
                    1997 I have again become a member of this Commission. I also went to Bilderberg
                    meetings at which Americans and Europeans gather for candid discussions, to
                    judge the mood across the Atlantic. I have been a member of the Board of
                    Visitors, or Board of Directors, for the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy
                    [of Tufts University] in the 1970s and 1980s. I belonged to some other
                    groups.</p>
                <pb facs="0460" n="Page0460"/>
                <p>Then, when I left government service after my stint as Ambassador to China, I
                    have covered the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 in Beijing. I was then in New
                    York, staying temporarily in the Plaza Hotel. I was on radio and TV all the time
                    that spring. Then we went out to Jackson Hole, Wyoming for several months during
                    the summer of 1989. My wife was writing a book, and I wrote a long article for
                    “Foreign Affairs” on China, which I have mentioned. Then I went back to New York
                    and became a member of the International Rescue Committee [IRC], the major,
                    non-sectarian group which takes care of refugees, both resettling them in the
                    U.S. and carrying on relief activities for them overseas. I became Vice Chairman
                    of the IRC and later Co-Chairman. Since leaving government service again in
                    1997, I again became Vice Chairman of the IRC. This organization was founded by
                    Albert Einstein in 1933 to help rescue Jews persecuted by the Nazis, both
                    artists and intellectuals, as well as others, and has helped during other crises
                    such as the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, assisting the Indochinese boat people,
                    Kurdish, Bangladeshi, Cambodian, and Afghan refugees. The IRC now operates in
                    some 30 countries, e.g. all over Africa, including the area of the Great Lakes
                    of Central and East Africa, dealing with all of the problems of Africa. We have
                    worked in the Balkans and Caucuses, parts of Asia and the Western Hemisphere. We
                    have resettlement offices in about 20 American cities.</p>
                <p>In the 1970s I was also a member of the Atlantic Council and the Atlantic
                    Institute following my mother there as well as at the IRC where she was once
                    President. When I left government service in 1989, I joined the National
                    Endowment for Democracy, an organization which promotes freedom and democracy
                    around the country. I eventually became Chairman of that organization. I also
                    was a director and/or member of the America-China Society, National Committee on
                    U.S.-China relations, the U.S.-Japan Foundation, American Academy of Diplomacy,
                    the Asia Society, the Draper Institute of Distinguished Fellows, and the Pacific
                    Council on International Policy</p>
                <p>In 1992 I headed up a Carnegie Endowment Commission on Foreign Policy. This was a
                    very distinguished group organized by Ambassador Mort Abramowitz. I was
                    Chairman. It was a very broad group which made foreign policy recommendations of
                    a bipartisan nature for the Clinton administration.</p>
                <p>These are examples of groups, think tanks, and commissions which I have been
                    involved in, for my own, intellectual enrichment, to have some impact on these
                    issues, and to keep my profile high, if necessary. In the case of the Council, I
                    traveled on its behalf in America extensively and also abroad. As I was a member
                    of the Council, I found it interesting and rewarding to do so.</p>
                <p>During this period (and later) I received several honorary degrees,some in
                    conjunction with my wife.</p>
                <p>When out of government I often testified before Congress on China.</p>
                <pb facs="0461" n="Page0461"/>
                <p>In 1983 and 1984 President Reagan set up a Commission on Central America and
                    persuaded Henry Kissinger to act as its Chairman. This Commission looked at the
                    problems of Central America, particularly Nicaragua and El Salvador, but also
                    other problems in that area involving revolutionary activities, determining who
                    were the good guys and who were the bad guys. We studied communist and radical
                    influences, as well as Right Wing excesses, the Contra question, and all of
                    these issues that were coming up. Kissinger appointed me, along with one other
                    person to this Commission, I believe Jeane Kirkpatrick, as Counsellor. I didn't
                    sign off on its recommendations, but I was one of those who took part in its
                    deliberations and helped to draft the report. I was a general advisor and an
                    observer, although I'm certainly not an expert on that region. The work of that
                    Commission covered a period of six to nine months.</p>
                <p>Q: What did you think of the work of that commission, which was headed by Henry
                    Kissinger, as you say? In a way Central America was sort of outside his world,
                    and outside your world as well.</p>
                <p>LORD: Absolutely. Of course, I didn't have any particular axe to grind, in terms
                    of the Latin American background. Kissinger was a person who was concerned about
                    Soviet influence. He had shown considerable interest, over the last couple of
                    years in the government in Latin America. He visited that area, he gave some
                    major speeches, particularly in Mexico. He asked me to work with him. He trusted
                    me, as I had worked with him for so long. He wanted my perspective as a non
                    expert. He had access to plenty of experts. I forget all of their names now.
                    However, it was a good commission. It worked hard. I don't want to single out
                    particular people on it, but one person who impressed me at the time was Jack
                    Kemp.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a Republican Congressman from New York.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: He worked very hard and was open-minded, not dogmatic. The Commission on
                    Central America included both liberals and conservatives. It came out with
                    balanced recommendations, as I recall. It acknowledged the dangers of radical or
                    Soviet and Cuban-supported regimes, but also the excesses of the right wing in
                    many cases. It accepted the need not only to counter nefarious influences but to
                    have positive programs and cooperation which could help governments and also
                    build alternatives to more radical solutions.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you feel the heavy hand of domestic politics on that Commission? One
                    thinks in particular of Senator Jesse Helms [Republican, North Carolina] but
                    also of others who were sort of using Central America as a sort of playground as
                    far as building up forces of good and evil, and all of that.</p>
                <pb facs="0462" n="Page0462"/>
                <p>LORD: The work of the Commission was potentially charged with emotion, but I
                    think that the composition of the Commission and the way it was conducted made
                    it relatively free of that. It took a relatively detached view. It certainly was
                    given a fairly clean slate by the administration. It didn't feel hemmed in. We
                    were aware of these currents boiling around us, but I think that the
                    Commission's work was carried out in a pretty professional, apolitical manner,
                    on the whole.XVII. CHINA LINKS AND CONFIRMATION PROCESS FOR AMBASSADOR TO CHINA
                    (1977-1985)</p>
                <p>Q: We are still carrying on the China theme and we're going back a little bit.
                    This session will be devoted to your time as Ambassador to China. You were
                    Ambassador to China from when to when?</p>
                <p>LORD: From November, 1985, to April, 1989. That April is an important date. Bette
                    and I were very fortunate to be in China during the most positive period in
                    Sino-U.S. relations since 1949.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. We touched on it before, but let's go back
                        again.Where were you when this job came out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I can give you a little background; I've taken some notes. First let me
                    just let me give you a brief paragraph on an amusing incident that took place
                    back in June, 1972. We can insert that in the proper place if that is all right.
                    It's amusing, but it depressed me at the time. I'll double check the date; I
                    think it was June, 1972. The Kissinger trip to China was as National Security
                    Advisor. At the welcoming tea at the guest house, Zhou En-lai was sitting with
                    Kissinger, and Kissinger in the course of their small talk, mentioned that I was
                    a very good ping pong player. I was aghast to have him say this because actually
                    while I was fairly decent, to say that you are a good ping pong player in China
                    is a bit like saying you are a good chess player in Russia. This came back to
                    haunt me.</p>
                <pb facs="0463" n="Page0463"/>
                <p>A few days later at the end of our visit, we were visiting a sports complex
                    outside of Beijing, and we saw volleyball players, and we saw swimmers, and we
                    saw gymnasts. I thought we were about to leave, and the escort said no we have
                    one more stop. We went into a gymnasium packed with a couple of thousand Chinese
                    students, and they brought out a ping pong table and announced to the crowd that
                    Winston Lord, expert ping pong player, accompanied by Dick Solomon who was with
                    me on that trip, would now play ping pong with Chang Tse Tung, who was three
                    times champion of the world, not just China but of the world, plus the current
                    Chinese champion. In any event we got out there and even though it was
                    friendship first and competition second, I wanted to show I was a decent player.
                    I was absolutely horrible, a combination of nerves plus big light balls that we
                    are not used to and funny racquets. I just absolutely disgraced myself and was
                    very depressed by this whole affair. When I got home from the trip, my wife
                    couldn't understand why I was so downcast because things had gone well
                    substantively and it was because of this event.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just out of curiosity, do the Chinese use a different type
                        ball?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Apparently they do. I'd always played with American balls, maybe this was
                    international standards. The ball kept sailing off my racquet because it was so
                    light. It also turns out that the player, the three time world champion, was a
                    lover of Madame Mao as I found out later.</p>
                <p>I left the State Department in 1977 when President Carter came in, to take a
                    break, to recharge my batteries. After eight months in the Colorado mountains, I
                    went to New York to become president of the Council on Foreign Relations in
                    September 1977. Since we were on China, I will just say how I kept up with China
                    during those intervening years until I was appointed. I generally kept reading
                    about China because of my interest and my background. I kept up my contacts with
                    the Chinese in Washington and New York. When the Carter administration first
                    came in I worked closely with Mike Oksenberg who was the China expert for Zbig
                    Brzezinski (National Security Advisor) going over our China policy and the
                    various records and transcripts. Throughout this period, I kept in touch with
                    him and Dick Holbrooke at State and others involved with China policy.</p>
                <p>In 1979 I took a trip to China with Kissinger; in addition to Beijing where we
                    had talks with Deng Xiaoping and others, we went to Xian and Xinjiang in the
                    northwest. This is in a period where Deng had just made his final comeback and
                    was beginning to launch his final reforms. A lot of our talks centered on his
                    plans for China's economy, as well as Soviet relations and the usual
                    international topics.</p>
                <pb facs="0464" n="Page0464"/>
                <p>In 1983 I went back on my own and got a warm reception from various Chinese
                    officials, and by then Deng's reforms and opening were beginning to pick up
                    steam. There was one other contact during this period, to go back to early 1979
                    when Deng Xiaoping visited the United States just after the announcement of the
                    normalization of relations on December 15; the normalization itself took place
                    on January 1. This, of course, was just before China invaded Vietnam. I
                    participated in a very small breakfast with Kissinger, just the two of us plus
                    Deng and probably the Chinese Liaison Chief. I don't recall. We could see then
                    that Deng Xiaoping was growing in self confidence which we also saw in our later
                    trip that year back to China. I also testified early that year on normalization,
                    supporting what the Carter Administration had done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is 1979.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: 1979. Why I favored moving ahead and thought that we could still maintain
                    security and friendship ties with Taiwan at the same time. In 1982 I testified
                    backing the Reagan administration on the third communiqu� that was negotiated
                    with respect to arms sales to Taiwan. Here I made the basic point that although
                    it was difficult because it envisaged a lowering over time of our arms sales to
                    Taiwan, I felt this was sufficiently linked to a peaceful resolution of the
                    crisis, that it would provide for Taiwan's security, and the Chinese made a very
                    forthcoming statement in the Communiqu� that their fundamental policy was to
                    seek a peaceful resolution. We couldn't actually get them to renounce force, but
                    we felt that was a strong enough indication along with our commitment and arms
                    sales in the same communiqu� to give us sufficient linkage and therefore we
                    could always provide for Taiwan's defense as long as they had a security
                    problem. We would only reduce arms sales as the situation got more peaceful.</p>
                <p>Now with respect to how I got the nomination in 1985, I think this was based on
                    first a general reputation on foreign affairs and of course, what I did on China
                    with Kissinger and Nixon and Ford. With respect to the Reagan administration, I
                    think we first met the Reagans in the fall of 1981 when Bette and I went to a
                    small White House dinner in honor of Isaac Stern, and his new movie called Mao
                    to Mozart. I had known George Shultz, the Secretary of State from the Council on
                    Foreign Relations where he was one of my directors. He asked me to lead a
                    Saturday all day seminar in January of 1983, fairly soon after he became
                    Secretary of State, on China with a lot of government officials there and
                    outside experts including Kissinger and others. That went well and increased
                    Shultz's confidence in me. I also knew Bud McFarland, the National Security
                    Advisor, from the Kissinger-Nixon-Ford days at the NSC. We were also invited to
                    the White House in January, 1984 for a dinner for the visiting Prime Minister
                    Zhao Ziyang. My wife, Bette, sat at the head table with the Prime Minister.</p>
                <pb facs="0465" n="Page0465"/>
                <p>Then Reagan, just before his trip to China in the spring of 1984 had a small
                    lunch of five outside advisors which included Scowcroft, Scalapino, Solomon, and
                    Bette, my wife, and myself. The five of us with the President and Mrs. Reagan,
                    and several cabinet level officials. This, I think, went very well again with
                    the President. Mrs. Reagan loved my wife's book Spring Moon, and we are told
                    that in August, 1984, Mrs. Reagan in a conversation with her husband, actually
                    made the suggestion that he appoint me as Ambassador and get two for the price
                    of one in effect. Not only would I be going to China but my wife, Bette, with
                    her unique background would be going along as well.</p>
                <p>So, in the fall of 1984, I believe it was October, McFarland was at a Council on
                    Foreign Relations dinner in New York. He sat next to me; I was President then.
                    He mentioned that the Administration wanted me to serve. Would I be interested?
                    Both he and subsequently someone from State suggested Ambassador to China.
                    Almost inexplicably and in retrospect somewhat foolishly, I said no I'd rather
                    serve in Washington for a variety of reasons. My father was quite sick. I wanted
                    to be near my son who was in his final year of high school and other personal
                    reasons. But the more I thought about it and talked about it with Bette, we
                    decided this was not as exciting as being Ambassador to China. By then Shultz
                    had already tried to get me an Undersecretary job at State but was running into
                    some delays at the White House. Anyway, I went back and said no, the other
                    option the ambassadorship, in fact, was our preferred one.</p>
                <p>Q: Excuse me. During the time you were in the Council of Foreign Relations and
                    dealing with these China. What sort of impressions were you getting, first of
                    the late Carter period of the people you were talking to, because you know,
                    there is this back and forth conversation? Then with the Reaganites about China.
                    Was it a realistic one?</p>
                <p>LORD:: Basically, I kept in close touch with the Carter Administration. I met
                    with Brzezinski, the National Security Advisor, a couple of times privately,
                    including just before he went to China in the summer of 1978 on one of his trips
                    which turned out to be very important. I felt they got off to a fairly rocky
                    start as I recall. They seemed to be emphasizing the Soviet Union, which I have
                    no problem with, but not moving on China. My impression was there was some
                    tension between Vance who was more interested in emphasizing Russia and
                    Brzezinski who was more interested in pursuing China. So, early on they were
                    having some difficulties, but by 1978 they moved toward normalization. Vance's
                    initial trip went badly, and meanwhile they were moving ahead with the Russians,
                    so the first year or so of the Carter Administration, things were not going very
                    well. I kept in touch with both State and the White House after the Brzezinski
                    trip, but, by the end of '78 they moved to normalization; they announced it in
                    mid-December while Congress was out of session, during the holiday season,
                    knowing it would be controversial. They announced that normalization would
                    actually take place on January 1. I felt that the normalization agreement was
                    about the best they could do vis a vis Taiwan, given the realities, and I along
                    with Kissinger and people who worked on this issue supported it, plus the Taiwan
                    Relations Act was passed which strengthened the Taiwan side of the equation. I
                    supported that as well and I actually testified on it.</p>
                <pb facs="0466" n="Page0466"/>
                <p>Then the China connection was pretty well maintained until Reagan came in, and
                    there was a great deal of apprehension by the Chinese and others about what
                    would happen to our China policy as President Reagan took office. He had after
                    all been very pro-Taiwan and very tough on the Chinese political system. It
                    generally looked like he might change the bipartisan policies that had been
                    pursued. I remember distinctly on various occasions with the Chinese in New York
                    and Washington, reassuring them saying that any President when he gets into the
                    oval office tends to have a different view of geo-politics. I thought this
                    President would be no exception; he would see the geo-political and other
                    benefits of moving ahead with China, but he wouldn't sell out his friends in
                    Taiwan and he would be respected for that as a reliable ally. I thought he would
                    essentially pursue the policy of his predecessors, particularly because among
                    other reasons, he had chosen Al Haig as Secretary of State who had been heavily
                    involved in the China opening and was very pro engagement with China. Haig would
                    be working on him as well as other advisors. So I told the Chinese to hold their
                    fire, with respect to Reagan, and give him some time to be worked on by his
                    associates and to gain a greater perception and appreciation from the oval
                    office. I recall that Bush went there - I guess it was between the election and
                    the inauguration in the fall - and he had a fairly tough trip over the Taiwan
                    issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]. Because Reagan said some things
                        durinthe campaign while Bush was in Beijing that the Chinese didn't
                        like.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: During the campaign he was there?</p>
                <p>Q: [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]. Yes, during the campaign.</p>
                <p>LORD: Okay. There were some rocky things at the beginning of the Reagan
                    Administration. The tension persisted as the Chinese ratcheted up the pressure
                    over the Taiwanese arms sales to the point where the Administration made the
                    choice, and Al Haig was very influential in this, to do a third communiqu�, the
                    first having been the Shanghai communiqu� during Nixon's trip in '72, the second
                    one on normalization in '79. This was a very difficult negotiation. Leonard
                    Woodcock was at the other end doing good work, and one of the people helping him
                    became my deputy in China, Peter Tomsen. They were working hard on it back at
                    home in the White House and the State Department. For reasons I have already
                    mentioned I believe the 1982 communiqu� was justifiable because of the implicit
                    linkage to a peaceful resolution, and this eased the tension between Beijing and
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>Q: By the way, I just want to insert that this is not only Stuart Kennedy here
                    but also Nancy Bernkopf Tucker who is the other interrogator.</p>
                <pb facs="0467" n="Page0467"/>
                <p>Q: [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]. In response to the answer you just gave to Stu's
                    question, one of the things that you mentioned was the normalization agreement
                    that established relations and you basically supported that. You thought it was
                    the best they could have gotten. I think that's probably true, but it was less
                    than the Nixon people thought they could get. Nixon and Kissinger had
                    anticipated for at least a long time that they could maintain some sort of
                    official relationship, a liaison office or something like that with Taipei. The
                    historians at least have looked at what the Carter administration did and said
                    he took less. Do you think that is a fair judgment? Was the Nixon period
                    estimate wrong?</p>
                <p>LORD: I'm not so sure it was the estimate. I would like to go back and talk to
                    Henry and others on that. Clearly we would have preferred, I'm sure the Carter
                    administration would have preferred, a somewhat more elevated tie remaining with
                    Taiwan. I don't think we were under any illusions that we could have maintained
                    an embassy certainly, and whether we thought we could get a liaison office, we
                    hadn't reached that level of concreteness during the Ford Administration. As I
                    said in an earlier transcript, President Ford, because of his domestic travails
                    and worrying about Reagan and renomination and the Chinese, because of the
                    Chinese domestic scene, the ascendancy of the Gang of Four, struggling with Deng
                    Xiao Ping, and then the succumbing of Mao and Zhou, didn't move on Taiwan during
                    the last year of his administration. So, we never got to that point although we
                    played with formulas.</p>
                <p>I don't recall now that we felt even privately that Carter had settled for too
                    little. We certainly publicly supported the deal, meaning Nixon, Kissinger, and
                    others. I don't recall that being a collective wisdom that we should have driven
                    a harder bargain. It is not my recollection. Even if I thought that, I might
                    have been bipartisan at the time, but that isn't my recollection of my own view
                    either. The fact that they were going to continue arms sales I felt was an
                    important and significant achievement, arms sales to Taiwan as well as the
                    unofficial ties to Taiwan. I also felt that it was not realistic to maintain a
                    treaty alliance or an embassy, so it seemed to me that it was in the ballpark.
                    Maybe I thought at the time we could have gotten a little bit better here and
                    there, but I, in good conscience, supported the basic deal that was struck. I
                    also was pleased at what the Congress did to strengthen our commitments to
                    Taiwan in the wake of normalization.</p>
                <p>Q: I was just wondering, during this period, did the Taiwan government, its
                    representatives in the United States carry much weight. I mean I assume they
                    were trying to disturb this whole situation with normalization.</p>
                <pb facs="0468" n="Page0468"/>
                <p>LORD: Because I was in New York, not in the government, I do not recall having
                    too many contacts with Taiwan during this period although I was always friendly
                    to Taiwan, so I'm not a good judge of that. Obviously, there was some criticism
                    in Congress and elsewhere. This was shown by the passage of the Taiwan Relations
                    Act, and there was some criticism that the Administration announced this during
                    the holiday season while Congress was out of town. It was actually quite wise.
                    It is better to do it during that quiet period despite the flak you take for the
                    timing. In practice it worked out better that way. But, my recollection is there
                    was general support, and that the reaction although quite tough in some quarters
                    was manageable, and that was eased by the Taiwan Relations Act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm ready to go back now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Okay. I'll try not to go into too much detail about my nomination. It's
                    pretty bloody. I knew from about February-March, 1985, I don't know exactly
                    when, that they were working on the nomination, so I began to work on the
                    various papers that you had to fill out. It didn't leak for awhile until I
                    finally got a call on March 30 from Rollie Evans, the journalist who had picked
                    up rumors. After that it began to leak. This is while my nomination was still
                    being formalized. You know how these things get out in the papers before they
                    are actually formal, so I had to be careful in my public comments. I told the
                    Council on Foreign Relations and the Chairman, David Rockefeller, that I would
                    leave on June 30. I thought I would be nominated and through the Senate during
                    the course of the summer.</p>
                <p>It was one of the happiest times of my life because I thought this was a perfect
                    fit, not only for me and my background, but for Bette and her background. There
                    were many overtones including the fact that our wedding reception was at Twin
                    Oaks, the Chinese Nationalist Embassy, that I had first gone into China in '71
                    with Kissinger, and all that had happened since that we talked about. I had some
                    concern about leaving my ill father, but you don't get into personal stuff in an
                    interview like this. And I was very sorry that my mother, who had passed away in
                    July 1978, never knew that I became Ambassador to China.</p>
                <pb facs="0469" n="Page0469"/>
                <p>In any event, on July 12, I was told that I would be getting a call from the
                    President officially asking me to serve, but right then he had this operation
                    for a cancerous polyp which delayed things. Finally instead of getting a call, I
                    got a very nice letter which was really personalized. It had shaky handwriting
                    with references to Bette and a word from Nancy. It was clear that it wasn't just
                    a pro forma letter. I spent this time, of course, getting briefings in
                    Washington, getting in touch with academics and business and human rights
                    groups, reading as much as I could whether it was long books or memos, etc.,
                    touching base with various constituencies. Li Xiannian, the President of China
                    came during this period, but I still wasn't official yet, so I couldn't sit in
                    on any of the meetings, but I got to the social occasions and Bette sat next to
                    him at lunch that Shultz gave and sat next to President Reagan at the White
                    House along with Liz Taylor and some others for this dinner. I had my hearing on
                    July 30 introduced by my New York Senator. Moynihan, was voted out by the
                    Foreign Relations Committee 16 to 1, but the day before that Helms had sent a
                    message to Lugar saying he couldn't show up for the hearing and he wanted it
                    delayed. What was the rush about such a controversial appointment?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Jesse Helms, the conservative Senator of North
                        Carolina.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Correct. Meanwhile the Chinese had given very fast agrement. Within 48
                    hours. After three months of my working on paperwork and security and everything
                    else, it came through right about the time of President Li's visit. The reason
                    for Helms' opposition ostensibly turned out to be on the abortion population
                    issue, but he had other reasons not to welcome my appointment. First I was a
                    moderate or liberal Republican which I guess is an oxymoron, but he was
                    suspicious of the Rockefeller New York wing. I had been Henry Kissinger's
                    closest associate, and he at that point (they have gotten friendlier since)
                    thought Kissinger had sold out to the Soviet Union and China and was generally
                    leftist which is quite ironic if you know Henry Kissinger. So, being close to
                    Kissinger was a strike against me. I was a member of the Trilateral Commission
                    which was one of his b�te noires. I was President of the Council on Foreign
                    Relations. He and his staff discovered all that. I had written an article in
                    Newsweek a couple years before that argue for a centrist foreign policy,
                    avoiding extremes. I had one sentence in there that I thought was pretty clever.
                    I was taking a crack at McGovern on one side and Jesse Helms on the other. I
                    said, “We should neither McGovern our foreign policy nor have Jesse at the
                    helm.” I told myself if I should run into this with Senator Helms at the
                    hearings I would say I'm talking about Jesse Jackson, not you.</p>
                <p>In any event there were a lot of reasons why he obviously wouldn't like me plus
                    my whole involvement in the China opening; he didn't like the China opening and
                    so on. I and the Administration were focusing on the need to get this
                    nomination, now being delayed by Helms having been voted on by the committee,
                    through by September so I could be in place for an October visit by Vice
                    President Bush to China which would be a wonderful way for me to begin my tour.
                    It was important to the Vice President as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0470" n="Page0470"/>
                <p>Without going into excruciating details, the next few months while getting ready
                    for my posting, I just pulled out all the stops to try to get the nomination
                    through, to get around Helms, to get through this situation. There are a lot of
                    details I won't go into. I have to say in all candor the Congressional Relations
                    Office of the State Department was totally incompetent. They were somewhat shy
                    about taking on Helms; they were browbeaten. Not only did they not push it very
                    much, they didn't even keep me informed. I had to keep asking where we stood
                    before they would let me know. I got really annoyed at the White House and the
                    Congressional Relations Office. The White House weighed in as we went on and
                    without going in to it blow by blow, at one point the President called Helms in
                    the middle of the Achille Lauro crisis, he called Helms from Air Force One.
                    Another time he wrote him a letter.</p>
                <p>I kept telling the Administration as much as I wanted my nomination completed in
                    time for the Vice President, I didn't want them to sell out substance. After all
                    I had overwhelming support in the Committee and in the Senate and I was well
                    qualified and a conservative American president, Reagan, appointed me which
                    ought to reassure Helms. It was not correct on principle to bend on population
                    policy or any other substantive issue just to get my nomination through. As
                    anxious as I was to get this going, I didn't want it to be at the expense of
                    Administration policy. There finally was a letter from the head of AID, Peter
                    McPherson to Helms in the Senate, wishy-washy in language that we would bend our
                    policy somewhat even a little beyond what I would have liked.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we finally got it through, but only after Bush had gone to China and come
                    back. I was very upset about that. Then when I saw I was going to miss that in
                    any event, I sort of backed off and just let nature take its course. I was
                    sufficiently exercised to get this through, I thought for the national interest,
                    also my personal interest in getting there on time for Bush, and just generally
                    that I pushed this very hard, even to the point where I thought some of my
                    colleagues in the State Department thought I was overdoing it. So, I sort of
                    laid back. By now the media had paid a lot of attention to this, and there were
                    editorials across the country including lead editorials in the New York Times
                    and the Washington Post and many other areas calling me a hostage and putting
                    pressure on Helms.</p>
                <pb facs="0471" n="Page0471"/>
                <p>There was one particularly painful incident where there was a last gasp try to
                    get me through and out there in time for Bush, and I even made a reservation for
                    a swearing in ceremony for October 8, 1985. My father was very sick in Florida,
                    but he made a major effort to come up for it. We had people invited, thinking
                    the Senate just might do it in time. It didn't work out, and so my father missed
                    my swearing in. He had to go back to Florida. It was another further delay for
                    another month, by which time he couldn't travel. Finally as a result of the
                    media pressure and the McPherson letter generally and as I say the President
                    calling Helms and these other efforts, they finally voted on the evening of
                    November 5. I was voted through 87-7. Helms took a crack at me for having
                    orchestrated a media campaign against him. It wasn't true actually, but I didn't
                    mind the compliment. I remember going down to Florida before we went to China, a
                    few days later and I saw my father and played him a tape of the swearing in
                    ceremony. I had a wonderful swearing in ceremony. Shultz swore me in personally,
                    and there was a tremendous turnout. I made some carefully thought out remarks
                    about U.S.-China relations and other personal dimensions.</p>
                <p>Q: I'd like to talk about for somebody who is not familiar. Could you quickly
                    explain why a minority Senator could stop this process, and also how you went
                    about, you say you pushed hard. How does one push hard in the political context
                    of the period? Then, finally, what was the abortion issue from Helms'
                    perspective and from the administration's perspective?</p>
                <p>LORD: These are fair questions. I won't go into them in great detail, but pushing
                    hard included lining up conservative friends of mine, conservative Republicans,
                    and have them go to Helms and others on the Hill and explain that I wasn't some
                    pinko Communist and that I was hard-headed. I didn't discourage media attention
                    certainly. I would press the State Department and the White House to be weighing
                    in not only with Helms and his people but also people like Bob Dole and others -
                    I guess he was minority leader even then of the Republicans. The Democrats
                    weren't giving me any trouble. And I was trying to work on parliamentary
                    maneuvers to get it up to a vote because I had already been voted out by the
                    Committee. So, it was getting people like Bill Buckley and others behind the
                    scenes to weigh in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill Buckley being a conservative columnist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Letting the media campaign go on, badgering State and the White House, but
                    all the while saying we shouldn't compromise on the population issue. So, this
                    is basically how I went about it. The population issue I don't want to get into
                    with precision. It is still with us even as we speak today in 1998, and it is
                    not unrelated. Basically it was a matter of funding for UN programs that went
                    back to the Mexico City issue even then I believe.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a women's conference in Mexico City, a United

                </p>
                <pb facs="0472" n="Page0472"/>
                <p>LORD: The specific issue, I believe, was the funding for UN programs which Helms
                    didn't want to do. We pointed out that we were not funding abortion, and the UN
                    programs were in fact for areas like education or contraception which would
                    lower the need for abortions if you looked at them sensibly. Helms' position was
                    that all these funding operations were fungible. Our funding would free up other
                    funding which would help abortions. I don't remember precisely how the issue was
                    framed or how the McPherson letter waffled on it, but I do have a recollection
                    that Helms won somewhat of a victory. There was a crimping of our funding, much
                    to my dismay. I made it clear that I would rather wait as long as necessary, but
                    the Administration felt it could live with a compromise, and they did want me to
                    get on to China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling at the time that these were deep
                        felfeelings of Senator Helms or was this sort of political ego.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: At the time I thought, although I know he felt sincerely about the abortion
                    issue, that if there wasn't the abortion issue, he would have found something
                    else in order to delay me personally because of my background. Put together the
                    Kissinger connection, the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign
                    Relations. You could even throw in Skull and Bones at Yale; he probably wouldn't
                    like that if he knew about it. The whole China involvement, being a liberal
                    Republican, I was anathema to him. He was always courteous as he always is, and
                    he was very courtly toward my wife and very polite toward me, but both he and
                    his staff assistant, a guy named Triplett, who has been around for many years,
                    stonewalled me. In pulling out the stops, I talked to Triplett as well. He kept
                    portraying himself as someone who was trying to help me. He was a new staffer
                    then. In retrospect he was also delaying, so I felt it was personal. But, also
                    it coincided with Helms' tactical approach, which he used on many nominations,
                    of trying to extract substantive concessions on policy in exchange for letting
                    names go forward, which is, I think a terrible distortion of the process. We are
                    living with that even as we speak today. It is a terrible morale blow and a
                    national interest blow to hold up important nominations in this hostage way. So
                    I'm convinced if it wasn't the population issue, he would have held me up on
                    some other reason.XVIII. AMBASSADOR TO CHINA - VARIOUS ISSUES (1985-1989)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. We might as well just keep going. Then you were able
                        ttake off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. Now let me make some general points about the years in China, and then
                    there are a few areas where I can get a bit more chronological. I do not have
                    the notes to say this happened this month or that month.</p>
                <p>Q: One thing too while we are talking about that. Did you carry in your mental
                    attach� case any things, you had been dealing with China a lot, that you really,
                    did you have your own agenda?</p>
                <pb facs="0473" n="Page0473"/>
                <p>LORD: That is exactly right. I thought I would give you some of my general goals
                    and things in general, and then we can go back into some specifics. I don't have
                    the kind of memory to go into great detail.</p>
                <p>A couple of comments about the period I served in China, from November, 1985, to
                    April, 1989. My timing really was quite fortunate. I got there when things were
                    really starting to move forward again. There was some tension in the early
                    Reagan years as I mentioned earlier, particularly over the Taiwan arms sales
                    question. The 1982 communiqu� broke that logjam, and therefore China and the
                    United States were beginning to have a more positive relationship. Obviously it
                    wasn't easy, but it was beginning to move forward again after having been tense
                    early in the administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Arthur Hummel. I left, we'll look at this later, but I left just before
                    Tiananmen Square erupted. In fact I left just after the first week of the
                    Tiananmen Square demonstrations. Hu Yaobang had died on April 15. His funeral
                    was April 22, and his funeral was the occasion for the first major outpouring of
                    Chinese citizens, roughly 100,000 that day, and of course, our relations took a
                    tailspin after the events of that spring.</p>
                <p>So, I was in a period which was probably the most positive period in U.S.-Chinese
                    relations since the opening. Obviously I thought I did a decent job, but I mean
                    it also was very fortunate timing, because if relations go well it is not really
                    thanks to the Ambassador. It is thanks to the overall climate and the leaders in
                    the capitals. I was there during a period where it really did move forward. We
                    had some real tensions as I'll get into, but not the incredible crises, and the
                    general movement was onward and upward. There was a tremendous increase in
                    exchanges and high level visits in both directions and agreements in trade and
                    other areas, and therefore, I felt very fortunate in that sense.</p>
                <pb facs="0474" n="Page0474"/>
                <p>I do want to mention without being overly awkward or self serving the role my
                    wife played there, her background and knowing the language, being Chinese of
                    course, and knowing the culture. Bette was a tremendous advisor to me informally
                    on how to deal with the Chinese culturally, psychologically and even how to
                    interpret their positions that I would talk to her about. She had an instinct no
                    barbarian could have. She had a tremendous circle of contacts for both me and
                    the Embassy as well as herself. There was a whole area of Chinese society that
                    would not have been possible to reach in such width and depth without her, her
                    language and the fact that she was a well-known authoress - academic circles,
                    cultural circles, intellectual circles, artistic circles which I would have in
                    any event tried to cultivate. We had tremendous entree thanks to her, and she
                    was a tremendous hostess both in terms of briefing visitors on Chinese culture
                    and history and on contacts but also in terms of entertainment. She always tried
                    to make our evenings different and interesting and fun, whether it was foreign
                    visitors, American visitors, diplomats or Chinese themselves. We either had an
                    interesting evening and or an entertaining evening. We never just had the
                    typical evening. We either had roundtable discussions of substance, or we'd have
                    Chinese opera singers or Chinese plays in our garden or musicians or other
                    entertaining, both to show off culture, but also to make an interesting evening.
                    This extended to very imaginative July Fourth parties, the anniversary of the
                    Shanghai Communiqu�, the anniversary of normalization. Also Bette worked with
                    Charlton Heston to put on a Chinese production of the Caine Mutiny which was an
                    extraordinary success.</p>
                <p>Bette would go with me and travel around the country and make a tremendous
                    impact. She was extremely well-known and popular in China. Some of the Chinese
                    leaders probably had some concerns probably because she knew too much. They
                    always liked to think they could fool the barbarians, but they knew they
                    couldn't fool her. She spent the bulk of her time, as she should, with her
                    official and professional contacts, helping me with the government officials,
                    the party officials and so on, as well as with Americans, the American business
                    community, academics and visitors. She spent a great deal of time to promote
                    U.S. interests, and out of her own personal interest too, in dealing with
                    Chinese intellectuals, artists and academics. Many of these were, of course,
                    pushing the envelope in terms of political freedoms in China, and many fell into
                    the grey area of semi or outright dissidents. Many later, of course, got swept
                    up by the events of June fourth (Tiananmen Square). So, among the more
                    conservative leaders, there were probably some suspicions of her, and even me as
                    we'll talk about later, on these contacts. The Chinese officials were
                    tremendously appreciative of her on the one hand, but probably some of the
                    conservatives were suspicious on the other hand.</p>
                <pb facs="0475" n="Page0475"/>
                <p>Bette worked very hard. She got a lot of publicity at the time even back here,
                    media articles, a Barbara Walters Special on 20-20 television, a big Washington
                    Post profile and so on, including on her interaction with Chinese students,
                    intellectuals, scholars, artists, writers and so on. I want to repeat that she
                    spent the bulk of her time promoting official ties. She wasn't shunning the
                    officials and the government, just the opposite in fact. The Foreign Ministry
                    and others were extremely enthusiastic about her, so she kept up her official
                    side very strongly. In the American community I suspect there were some who felt
                    that she spent too much time with the Chinese and not enough time with the
                    American community. She felt that was the proper priority because of American
                    interests in helping to interpret China as well as to expand our contacts and
                    our interests. There were times where the diplomatic community felt that both
                    she and I didn't pay as much attention as we might. I had a clear list of our
                    priorities, and I'll get to that in just a minute. Dealing with my fellow
                    Ambassadors was not high on my list. I would stay in touch if they were
                    particularly good ones who could help me understand what was going on in China.
                    Diplomatic dinners were generally late and boring and not very useful. I
                    certainly was friendly and not rude, but I had to choose my priorities. Spending
                    a lot of time with my fellow Ambassadors was not one of them, and that was true
                    of Bette as well.</p>
                <p>Some of the events that Bette produced, either at our residence or elsewhere,
                    were truly imaginative, even spectacular. To take just one example - the party
                    she staged at the Great Wall hotel to celebrate the tenth anniversary of our
                    diplomatic relations. This was in December 1988. It was the biggest Western
                    party for the Chinese since 1949. 1800-2000 guests. 36,000 (five kinds)
                    dumplings. The Chinese Olympic table tennis team. 3000 slides and special movies
                    on ten screens that Bette painstakingly put together after wheedling them from
                    American sources. During this period Bette and I did a major media and speaking
                    blitz.</p>
                <p>One last point on Bette. She and I felt strongly that at our July 4th party, we
                    should have Chinese visitors to help celebrate July 4th with us as well as the
                    Chinese employees of the Embassy taking part as a joint celebration. We had a
                    huge block party that we instituted. She lined up McDonalds and other companies
                    to provide free food. We had bands and music and games and booths and parades.
                    Just tremendous what she orchestrated. But the first July 4th party in 1986, we
                    ran into trouble with the some of American community and business who felt that
                    Chinese shouldn't be included.</p>
                <p>Bette, justifiably, got extremely high marks for her role. A glowing personal
                    profile in “The Washington Post.” A “20/20” special on ABC TV with Barbara
                    Walters. The highest USIA award from Mr. Wick, head of USIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying in the American community there were
                        certairacist...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0476" n="Page0476"/>
                <p>LORD: I don't want to say the whole community, but among some of the business
                    people and some of the Embassy there was a feeling of why are we involving the
                    Chinese in our celebration which I felt was both wrong and stupid. It was a
                    tremendous opportunity to engage the Chinese. But there was a certain amount of
                    racism there, you could tell. In any event, we always included the Chinese, and
                    this proved extremely popular. That was just an example where there was some
                    critical attention by some of the American community, although the great bulk of
                    them and all the visitors were extremely high on Bette, her briefings, and her
                    entertainment for them.</p>
                <p>One other amusing incident involving her novel, Spring Moon. As usual in China,
                    they were pirating it and as they did with all authors, putting out unauthorized
                    translations. There was one being done by committee that was incredibly bad. We
                    counted up in just the first chapter alone 101 mistakes, many big mistakes, not
                    just the natural mistranslations. Not only was it inaccurate, but there was no
                    sense of style or elegance. Now, Bette was not concerned about making money or
                    royalties and was not naive about the ability to enforce intellectual property
                    rights, but was concerned that all her Chinese friends and colleagues would
                    understand she could write well, and she didn't want it mangled. So, she went to
                    the Minister and Vice Minister of Culture when this unauthorized edition was
                    about to come out and said that if this was actually published, we would
                    personally, and we were prepared to do this, buy up all the copies, bring them
                    to the Embassy, invite all the foreign journalists, have a bonfire and burn the
                    books in our Embassy courtyard. It sounds like a joke and overly dramatic, but
                    literally we were going to do that. Fortunately, there wasn't total freedom in
                    China at least in this area, and it so happens that this edition was killed.
                    Then Bette worked with the wife of the Vice Minister of Culture, a famous
                    Chinese actor named Ying Ruochen. She did a tremendous translation of Spring
                    Moon. Bette worked with her until the last chapter and then tragically she died
                    of a blood disease. On her death bed, she said she regretted not finishing the
                    last chapteThen Ying himself did the final chapter and it was a very well done
                    translation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you'd better for the record here give the
                        substance of otheme of Spring Moon because it is mentioned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I don't know how relevant this is. She's written several books, but this
                    was her first novel, and it turned out to be a huge best seller for eight months
                    in hardback and number one in paperback. Translated all over the world, main
                    selection Literary Guild. It is basically a novel of China; it takes place in
                    the late 19th century up through essentially the 1930s, but it jumps with an
                    epilogue to the opening to China in the early 1970s. It is the story of Spring
                    Moon, this woman and how she grows up and goes through various travails. It is
                    full of the history and culture of China but also Spring Moon's personal
                    story.</p>
                <pb facs="0477" n="Page0477"/>
                <p>On Bette, I just want to make the point that she was a tremendous help to me
                    personally, not only a good marriage but also in terms of advice and all she did
                    in expanding our contacts, projecting America at its best, great imagination and
                    entertainment, and working hard to promote official ties. Therefore it gave an
                    extra dimension to our stewardship together.</p>
                <p>Now, with respect to me, I thought very hard during this longer-than-I-wished
                    period of getting ready to go to China while I was waiting for confirmation,
                    reading up and briefings on how I wanted to advance the relationship, how I
                    wanted to conduct the Embassy and my own priorities. I knew that this
                    relationship was going to continue to be mixed sweet and sour if you will. We
                    had too many differences for it to be smooth whether it was human rights or
                    historical and geographic separation. But, I also was firmly convinced there
                    would be great national interests in moving forward with China. Obviously
                    geopolitical interest which existed then, of course, with respect to balancing
                    off Russia, potential trade, cultural, technological and other interests that
                    were beginning to pick up steam. Regional and global security and other matters
                    that we should be working on. So I made, of course, this determination to move
                    this relationship forward.</p>
                <p>As for my priorities, and some of these are overlapping. I can't list them in
                    order, but obviously, my first priority was to advance American interests not
                    only with a general engagement with China, but to promote U.S. positions, get
                    Chinese cooperation wherever we could on international and regional issues, as
                    well as to expand our bilateral links both as an end in itself and to develop
                    more constituencies on both sides of the Pacific for a stronger relationship.
                    The more you have various fields interacting, the more you have people both in
                    China and the U.S. arguing for a positive relationship for their own self
                    interest and increasing mutual understanding and linkage between us. So my top
                    priority was advancing our interests, expanding the relationship,relaying U.S.
                    positions, and pushing the Chinese on areas where we wanted their help or
                    restraint. The problems included importantly in the years I was there, their
                    dealings on missiles with Iran and Saudi Arabia for example, as well as on human
                    rights generally and in Tibet in particular. That was clearly my overall
                    priority.</p>
                <p>Secondly to report on China, to increase understanding in the U.S. about China. I
                    felt very strongly that Ambassadors in general and I in particular should do
                    this clear-eyed, make sure that people in Washington and other readers would
                    understand what was going on in China. This would include the Chinese point of
                    view, but, emphatically avoid clientitis and localitis. I thought it was very
                    important in order to maintain credibility with your readers, to be firm enough
                    with the Chinese, and to give a clear picture of them, that you could not
                    succumb to being snowed by your hosts. A lot of Ambassadors face this danger.
                    The Chinese are particularly seductive, and so I was determined not to fall into
                    that trap and always to be worried about American interests and tough with the
                    Chinese when it was necessary. I would recommend we be tough when necessary, but
                    also remind Washington and others of the larger stakes in the relationship, not
                    letting one issue upset the whole relationship. Reporting on China was,
                    therefore, a very important priority as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0478" n="Page0478"/>
                <p>Thus, number one was advancing U.S. interests and presenting U.S. positions and
                    negotiating for the U.S., and second was reporting on China. I think the third
                    one was building up all these links that I mentioned earlier. Specifically, we
                    had some clandestine cooperation with the Chinese in the intelligence area that
                    even now I can't go into great detail on. It has become public since so I can
                    mention that this included, on the positive side, working with them on
                    monitoring Soviet missile tests and deployments, working with them to provide
                    arms to the Afghan resistance against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and
                    sharing intelligence on other parts of the world. At the same time, of course,
                    it still was a Communist country. There was mutual suspicion on each side,
                    spying like mad on each other, so it was a complex intelligence relationship.
                    This positive side, much of it directed vis a vis Russia, even as we tried to
                    improve relations with Russia, was sort of an anchor in Sino-U.S. relations. We
                    had begun during the Kissinger-Nixon days sharing intelligence with the Chinese,
                    but it really began in earnest under Brzezinski and Carter when we began to
                    monitor Soviet activities and provide joint aid to the Afghan resistance. We
                    maintained that strongly while I was there. Even when there was tension in the
                    relationship on other issues or across the board, this aspect of the
                    relationship was never really affected. We could go forward in good times and
                    bad and build on a solid foundation, not known by the public and only by a few
                    in the Congress. It was important for both sides in times of tension that we had
                    this overall strategic interest to work together as well as we could.</p>
                <p>Concretely our CIA people spent a great deal of time working with the Chinese on
                    providing arms through Pakistan to Afghanistan resistance against the Soviets,
                    and monitoring Soviet missile and other activities. Sino-American cooperation on
                    Afghanistan was crucial.</p>
                <p>Q: I would think on the intelligence side, you say each side was spying on each
                    other in a normal way, but did you find the Chinese effort was the way it has
                    been my experience with the North Koreans and South Koreans, the Yugoslavs when
                    there was a Yugoslavia, spending a hell of a lot of their time really spying or
                    checking the dissident movements in the United States. In other words were they
                    looking as to what is the United States up to or what were the overseas Chinese
                    up to?</p>
                <pb facs="0479" n="Page0479"/>
                <p>LORD: I was involved really more with their surveillance of us in China. I wasn't
                    all that familiar in detail with what they were doing in the U.S. They didn't
                    have that many students as yet in college in the United States. That began to
                    expand as we went along, and those are people they'd be watching. Clearly they
                    were eavesdropping and doing things on us in the U.S. even as we were doing that
                    in China. I can't get into detail. We had the constant reality that we figured
                    everything was bugged including our entire household, so we were always careful
                    whenever we spoke in the house unless we wanted to make a point like I hope we
                    aren't having sea slugs at the next Great Hall banquet. You felt, obviously,
                    that you and your people were being followed. In my case, they did it out of
                    security reasons among others. They wanted to make sure nothing would happen to
                    me. Of course, you feel more secure ironically, in a Communist controlled
                    society. You won't get hurt by criminals or other elements because the Chinese
                    are always around and they have got things under control. It wasn't pleasant,
                    but I had the feeling that I could walk around or ride around on my bike without
                    any trouble at a time when worldwide at many of our posts we had increasing
                    concerns about security. It was a major concern at that point if you look back,
                    with the whole project of fortifying our Embassies and so on. We beefed up our
                    security. I always felt personally it was one of the pleasures of China that I
                    could ride my bike, walk anywhere without any security concerns. The downside
                    was that you always had to watch what you say except in the bubble in the
                    Embassy. You had to be careful in other parts of the Embassy, even in your
                    office as well as at home. Even in our car which we assumed was bugged. I did
                    feel our security was quite lax. We had been briefed, before going out, in the
                    Ambassadors course about the need for security. Within a day or two of my
                    arrival, I walked around and checked out the security of ouEmbassy building and
                    other buildings there. We tightened things up. On security, the main point I
                    want to make is one we spent quite a bit of time in this area to strengthen the
                    relationship even as we tried to learn more about what was going on in China. It
                    was a very mixed relationship. While I was there, we had three secret visits
                    from three Directors of CIA.</p>
                <p>I also was interested over this period and had some success in expanding our
                    military to military contacts. I felt this was important. We shouldn't rush it
                    because of the differences we had, and we shouldn't do anything to jeopardize
                    national security. The military always had and always would play an important
                    political role in China, so we wanted to reach that constituency. It would give
                    us a chance over time to get a better sense of Chinese strategic and military
                    intentions and capabilities. It would send useful signals to the Soviet Union
                    and other potential adversaries about this relationship with China. Moreover,
                    the military was important with respect to the export of dangerous weapons which
                    we didn't like. If you want to get at non-proliferation, you really have to talk
                    to the military. At this point in the relationship we were getting into a more
                    positive footing after two decades of mutual isolation and hostility, so I
                    thought military contact was useful symbolism.</p>
                <pb facs="0480" n="Page0480"/>
                <p>So, for all these reasons we worked on this. We had some modest arms sales. We
                    had increasing exchanges of visitors. I think while I was there, every Chief of
                    Staff of the services came over and most Chinese went the other direction. There
                    were Secretary of Defense visits and theirs going the other direction. We had
                    the first ship visit, very dramatic, one of the highlights of my stay there in
                    October 1986 in Qingdao. Three American ships came in for the very first time.
                    We worked very hard on this, and this military part of the relationship expanded
                    during this period, but was cut off by Tiananmen Square just after I left in
                    1989. Similarly on the cultural side...</p>
                <p>Q: [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]. Before you go on to culture, on the issue of arms
                    sales, that had long been a very controversial one. It arose initially during
                    the Carter years, and there was that very controversial article by Mike
                    Pillsbury on Foreign Policy recommending this part as a way to get the
                    relationship back on track and move it along. By the time you were Ambassador,
                    was it still controversial?</p>
                <p>LORD: It was still controversial but less so as we had moved ahead with China, as
                    we normalized with China. There were some things in the works I believe,
                    certainly by the time I got there, I think by the time Reagan took over from the
                    previous administration. I don't recall precisely how far back some of these had
                    gone. It included working with them on their rather dated but important F-8
                    fighters, the avionics with that. It included radar for their artillery which
                    was relevant to Vietnam. Some upgrading of some of their ships. These are some
                    of the significant areas. We didn't want to go so fast as to excite controversy
                    in the U.S., but felt obviously that for the Chinese military getting a hold of
                    some of our technology - even if it lagged behind our best - was important in
                    terms of getting their cooperation. We certainly weren't going to do anything
                    that was going to be a threat to Taiwan in our view or to military balances in
                    general. Most of the technology or help we are talking about was 20 years old,
                    give or take a few years. We felt this limited attempt was useful politically
                    and psychologically without causing any undue controversy or upsetting any
                    military balances. I don't recall it being overly controversial at the time. The
                    negotiations with the Chinese always took time. In addition we had these
                    functional exchanges at the National Defense University level for more junior
                    officers. And higher ranking generals and admirals going in both directions,
                    Chiefs of Staff and Secretaries of Defense, and the whole thing was beginning to
                    move forward.</p>
                <p>Q: [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]. How satisfied were you with transparency? More
                    recently there have been complaints that we show the Chinese everything; they
                    don't show us much until a recent breakthrough with Secretary Cohen. But as a
                    general rule there hasn't been a very good balance.</p>
                <pb facs="0481" n="Page0481"/>
                <p>LORD: There hasn't been a particularly good balance. We always tried to get more
                    access to what they were doing and we would have some staged visits to some of
                    their units and facilities. When the Secretary or the Chiefs of Staff would
                    come, they were probably embarrassed by how far behind they were us. So there is
                    no question we consciously knew that in terms of technology, of course, even in
                    terms of transparency and access, that they were getting more than we gave them.
                    You couldn't see this as something you could balance off exactly. For example,
                    if they see more of our bases and capabilities we figured that would impress
                    them about how strong we were militarily and how far behind they were. They had
                    an interest generally in dealing with us as a geopolitical superpower and
                    specifically in terms of our technology, so we thought it was to our advantage
                    to show our capabilities. We thought over time it would be more mutual. We kept
                    pressing them on transparency, but I would grant that we didn't get the kind of
                    reciprocity that one would normally expect or hope for, but we knew what we were
                    doing.</p>
                <p>We had the same thing on the intelligence side, as I mentioned in the last
                    session, in sharing intelligence with them. Generally we would tell them more
                    about what was going on than we would get from them. We did so to advance our
                    interests, to make them a little nervous about the Russians or concerned about
                    some of their partners in the Middle East who we thought were not helpful
                    elements to regional stability. We did so partly to try to get more information
                    out of them. Here again, we gave more than we got, as one would expect from a
                    more advanced country, but also we felt it would pay off for us even though it
                    wasn't strict reciprocity. It was sort of the same principle as the military
                    exchanges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While we are on the military subject. What was the
                        evaluation you were getting from the visits and all? I mean what were our
                        military people saying to you about the capabilities and perhaps the
                        positioning? What were the Chinese using their military for during that
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, they were way behind us. When you visit their ships or see their
                    aircraft or even their elite ground units, you could see just how far behind
                    they were. They had a major big army but it was not that strong because of all
                    its weaknesses. They were just then beginning to cut down the size of the army.
                    I don't remember the chronology of this. They were trying to begin to modernize,
                    and that is, of course, where they had an interest with us in getting
                    technology. Of course, they asked for a lot more than we were willing to give
                    them. I want to make that clear. We were measured in our approach. They also had
                    an unfortunate experience with Vietnam; when they invaded in 1979, they really
                    got a bloody nose from the Vietnamese. If they couldn't handle the Vietnamese,
                    who could they handle? I just have to go back and read the literature about
                    their strategy at that point. They were beginning to move away from, I think,
                    Mao's mass mobilization where you swallow people up if they invade you; they
                    began to try to have a somewhat leaner and meaner force and more technologically
                    advanced, but they had an awful long way to go.</p>
                <pb facs="0482" n="Page0482"/>
                <p>On nuclear weapons they have evolved a great deal since those days in terms of
                    their attitude. We were concerned about non-proliferation, although most of the
                    issues we had with the Chinese in that period were on missiles, Silkworms to
                    Iran and some other missiles to Saudi Arabia. They did that to earn money for
                    the PLA as well as to gain friendship and influence in other countries. On the
                    nuclear side, they had a fledgling capability then for deterrence purposes, only
                    regional in nature; they certainly couldn't reach us at that point. At the time
                    they were obviously relaxed about proliferation; they were helping Pakistan with
                    its program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean were we seeing during this period, mobilizing
                        toward ainvasion of Taiwan? Militarily I assume you were watching this
                        closely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No. I want to make sure my memory doesn't play tricks on me. We would
                    always watch their deployments. While I was there, there was no Taiwan military
                    crisis such as we had in the spring of 1996 or we had earlier when we didn't
                    have relations. Their concern was less with Taiwan and more vis a vis the Soviet
                    Union, to a certain extent Vietnam, and they had tensions with India going back
                    to the 1962 war. They had residual historical concerns about Japan and Korea.
                    The Chinese had opened up to us in large measure due to their concern about the
                    Russians. There was a general calculation on their part that the far barbarian,
                    the United States, was less threatening to them in history and geography than
                    the near barbarians. They might not have trusted us or liked us particularly but
                    they felt that since we were not on their borders and since on balance compared
                    to some of their neighbors we had been relatively benign in our history, that
                    they had less to fear from us. We had not invaded them like Japan. We had not
                    taken large parts of their territory - at least as they saw it - like Russia. We
                    had not fought them like Korea or India except in the Korean War. On the whole
                    we were a strong and distant barbarian, and by being in the area and dealing
                    with them, this helped provide geopolitical and security balance as they looked
                    around their borders not only to the Russian threat to the north but these
                    others that I have mentioned. In terms of their deployments and other concerns,
                    it was clearly at that point to the north with the Russians and to a certain
                    extent the south, the Vietnamese, and the Indians. There were not large
                    threatening deployments vis a vis Taiwan.</p>
                <p>A more general point. While I was Ambassador, the Taiwan issue was remarkably
                    quiet - probably the calmest phase we've ever had with the PRC. This was partly
                    due to the easing of tensions through the 1982 Communique. Partly the general
                    advance of our time. Partly our cooperation against the Soviets, including heavy
                    duty work together on shipping arms through Pakistan to the Afghan
                    resistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To put in context, '89 was not only Tiananmen Square but
                        also the beginning of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. We are talking
                        about a time where the Soviets were still involved in Afghanistan and the
                        Soviet Union was the Soviet Union, not Russia.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0483" n="Page0483"/>
                <p>LORD: That's correct and it was still their primary concern when I was
                    Ambassador. Now they were already easing relations with the Russians during this
                    period. Gorbachev gave a speech in Vladivostok on Asia that I considered very
                    significant at the time. I have to check the date, it must have been about 1987.
                    Clearly that was a pitch for better relations with China. I think the Chinese
                    felt it would help them deal with us, along with their own security concerns, if
                    they could ease relations with Russia, and it would help them in terms of their
                    military deployments and expenditures. They were beginning to move with the
                    Russians - not at an alarming rate - but I thought it was significant, more so
                    than some of my colleagues. In our reporting cables, I emphasized the importance
                    of the Vladivostok speech and their concern about the Russians. They of course -
                    this is jumping forward - were improving relations, and Gorbachev was to come
                    there in May, 1989. They didn't like the political reforms he was instituting.
                    They thought this was dangerous in terms of maintaining party control and
                    maintaining the empire. In a way they were right, given what happened in Russia,
                    but they drew the wrong conclusions about the need for political as well as
                    economic reform. In any event, their main concern was still north and to a
                    certain extent south, not really pressure on Taiwan during this period.</p>
                <p>Q: We are talking about this Soviet situation. How in your discussions of your
                    Embassy, did you use the Soviet card or did you let the Chinese figure out what
                    the Soviets were up to themselves?</p>
                <p>LORD: We like to think we did it in a somewhat sophisticated fashion. After all
                    this had been going on now since the early 1970s and here we are in the late
                    1980s. We were trying to improve relations with the Russians at the same time.
                    We made no secret of that with the Chinese. We also kept telling the Chinese we
                    hope you can improve relations. In fact, our view was, and it was sincere, we
                    wanted a Sino-Soviet relationship that was not tense or hostile but certainly
                    wasn't an alliance. The situation that had existed in 1969 for example, the
                    border clashes, we genuinely thought were too dangerous and too tense. It could
                    lead not only to a conflict between then but a wider conflict in the region with
                    others and even perhaps the nuclear dimension. Even if you could crudely say it
                    is nice to have these two guys fighting each other, we didn't want that kind of
                    hostile, tense relationship between these two major powers.</p>
                <pb facs="0484" n="Page0484"/>
                <p>So, to the extent they were improving relations and easing tensions we would
                    favor that. Now, we obviously didn't want them to go all the way back to the
                    1950s and be solid allies again. We wanted to have better relations with each
                    one than they had with each other. We felt there was a limit on how far the
                    Sino-Soviet rapprochement could go, and therefore we were genuinely relaxed
                    about the progress they were making with Moscow, and conveyed that to the
                    Chinese both out of sincerity and out of tactics. You don't want to make them
                    feel that they are getting you nervous with their relations with the Russians.
                    We felt that the Russians and the Chinese each needed us more than they could
                    possibly use each other. Of course, in economic terms for the Chinese this is a
                    constant theme from the early 1970s to even as we speak today. The Chinese
                    needed us for the number one priority of developing their country, modernizing
                    their economy, lifting the standard of living of their people, and maintaining
                    Communist party control by giving their people a better life, calculating that
                    man or woman lives by rice alone. That is their number one priority, and they
                    need our technology, our marketing skills, our capital investment, our knowhow,
                    our trade. In order to do that, they don't want to be dependent on Japan or
                    anyone else. As we speak now, we take a third of their exports and we are still
                    the key investment and technological provider. They needed us for that. The
                    Russians needed many of the same things from us. They couldn't get that from
                    each other given their economies. They both needed us, and we figured that was a
                    constraint on their getting so close that they would engender hostility or
                    nervousness on our part and therefore lose out on the economic connection with
                    us. Similarly on the geopolitical front, yes we had tensions with Russia, the
                    cold war and the nuclear dimension, but we weren't bordering them, unless you
                    count Alaska and Vladivostok, as China was. We didn't have troops facing off
                    against each other, and we didn't have this long history of Sino-Soviet tension.
                    We felt there would always be that constraint between Moscow and Beijing, that
                    no matter how much they patched up their relations, there would be this mutual
                    suspicion.</p>
                <p>To make a long story short, we tried better relations with both. Usually we went
                    ahead simultaneously or we fell backward simultaneously. It was not a zero sum
                    gain from our standpoint. We did try to remind the Chinese that even as we hoped
                    they would have better relations, they shouldn't feel secure for all eternity
                    vis a vis Russia, but we tried this in a subtle way. We would keep briefing them
                    on Russian deployments and so on so that they would be reminded of Soviet
                    strength and the need to maintain a relationship with us. We would keep them
                    fully posted on our relations with Russia, again striking a balance to show that
                    we were trying to move ahead with Moscow and we were having some success to make
                    them a little uneasy, but also making it clear that we were tough and not being
                    snowed by the Russians, or overlooking the dangers of falling in love with
                    d�tente. I'm talking about the '70s as well as when I was there, so we were
                    always trying to strike this kind of balance. I think on balance, and this is
                    true of administrations I didn't serve in, that on the whole we have done this
                    quite well and quite effectively.</p>
                <pb facs="0485" n="Page0485"/>
                <p>Q: What about you in Beijing and our Ambassador in Moscow as well as the European
                    bureau and East Asian bureau? Was this just you sort of working on instinct or
                    was there sort of a controlling hand as to how we were dealing with two
                    superpowers?</p>
                <p>LORD: Of course this always has to be integrated from Washington, the White House
                    and the State Department and other agencies. They'd have to balance off our
                    Russian and China policies. I think I had the advantage in my job of not only
                    having the China background, but a general background in policy where I was head
                    of State Department Policy Planning, special assistant to Kissinger, and head of
                    the Council on Foreign Relations. I had a global view which was useful in my
                    talks with the Chinese in terms of my credentials, including having done a lot
                    with the Russians during my NSC period. By the way, I kept up with the Russian
                    Ambassador in Beijing. I forget the first guy's name, but then he was followed
                    by Troyanovsky. We kept in constant touch, working lunches together, even a
                    basketball game which we won, thanks to our Marines.</p>
                <p>But, to get to your question, there was not a lot of tension between our Moscow
                    Embassy and our Embassy in Beijing. It was not as if our Ambassadors to India
                    and Pakistan were facing off against each other, which happens a lot. We didn't
                    have that kind of problem at all as I recall. We'd each of course, send a copy
                    of any cable we'd send to Washington to each other. We'd do this always with
                    Embassies Moscow or Japan or Korea or other key people in Europe on our cables,
                    and they would do the same, so there was coordination that way. I don't recall
                    any incidents or events where there was real bloody battles between us and
                    Embassy Moscow or real disputes about the triangular dimensions. We also were
                    meticulous in debriefing the Chinese if there had been a summit meeting with the
                    Russians, like Reagan at Iceland for example, or arms control agreements or
                    negotiations. Ambassador Rowny, who did a lot of the negotiations, came several
                    times, as did other negotiators to fill them in. I like to think we played this
                    in a relatively sophisticated way.</p>

                <p>LORD: Well, my Deputy, Peter Tomsen, had served in the Political section in

                    recall whether we had others with great expertise. We didn't have a single

                <p>Q: Because sometimes we had. How about a China hand in Moscow?</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, I think there were people in Moscow who had served in China, but I

                    purpose.</p>

                    it the Gorbo mania. Gorbachev was a new type Soviet leader, and he became rather
                    the darling of Europe, the British, and the United States in this period and
                    seemed to have a rapport with Ronald Reagan which was happening during your
                    time. I was wondering whether they were feeling miffed or concerned that we were
                    getting too close to the Soviets?</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, first if the Chinese were miffed or concerned, they would not show
                    it. I mean just for tactical reasons, they wouldn't want to show they were
                    concerned. We got a lot of lectures as you recall from earlier sessions from
                    Deng Xiaoping and others in the '70s about being naive about the Soviets, not
                    being tough enough. We didn't hear that in the '80s, probably because they were
                    improving their own relations. With respect to Gorbachev, however, I don't
                    recall that they were all that frank in their discussions with us. Clearly we
                    knew that they were suspicious of what he was doing and had real ambivalence.
                    They liked the fact that he wanted to improve relations with China, and they
                    worked with him on that, but they were very concerned about what Gorbachev was
                    doing on the domestic political front in terms of freeing up that society both
                    because it might have a contagion effect in China and unleash similar currents
                    there and because they felt, and they were correct in a way, that this would
                    lead to lack of control by the Communist Party in Russia and even loss of their
                    empire. So, they were suspicious of Gorbachev, and generally on balance, didn't
                    like him. On the other hand, they were pragmatically dealing with him to improve
                    their bilateral relationship.</p>
                <p>We can pick up some of these things again later, to get back to bilateral
                    relations, we spent a lot of time trying to expand educational and cultural
                    affairs with the Chinese. We made some progress here, but there is always some,
                    and it continues to this day, restrictive paranoid quality about Western ideas.
                    Basically the Chinese strategy was to get Western technology and Western money
                    without being subverted by western ideals, culture and ideas. We made some
                    progress in terms of agreements signed and exchanges back and forth. Bette
                    worked extremely hard on this and did a lot to promote groups going back and
                    forth, but we would have reminders of their repression.</p>
                <pb facs="0487" n="Page0487"/>
                <p>I remember one example where we were going to send to China an exhibit from the
                    National Portrait Gallery. Just before it was about to come over, the Chinese
                    said there are two portraits that cannot be included in this. One is Golda Meir
                    from Israel, the other is General MacArthur, I guess because of the Korean War
                    connection. We were very tough. There were some in my USIA section who wanted to
                    bend on this. I thought this was absolutely wrong. I'm not saying everyone in
                    the section, but some elements who sort of wanted to work it out with the
                    Chinese. I said we had to be very tough on this out of principle. Furthermore
                    there was some absurdity here. It is not as if we were putting Hitler there. It
                    was pretty absurd to pick on Golda Meir and even MacArthur. We were prepared to
                    make sure that the texts underneath the pictures wouldn't go out of their way to
                    be insulting to China. We weren't about to remove the pictures. I thought it
                    would be bad both generally as a principle and setting a precedent for future
                    cultural exchanges, and also I thought it would set off an uproar in the United
                    States where there is still understandably great suspicion of China not only on
                    its human rights but its cultural repression. So we hung very tough on this, but
                    the Chinese wouldn't give in and the portrait exhibit didn't take place. This
                    was an example of their idiocy. This took place about 1987, about that time. So,
                    we have continued examples like that. We did manage nevertheless, to have
                    considerable expansion of student and cultural exchange, and science and
                    technology. We worked very hard on all that. Along with other aspects of our
                    growing relationship there was a great increase of exchanges both ways in all
                    these fields, not to mention business activity and tourists in China.</p>
                <p>Q: What about with student exchange, I know that it was very evident with any
                    exchange program we had with the Soviet Union. The Soviets were sending people
                    to learn hard science, and we were sending people to learn about icons. It was
                    of this nature and the Soviets were milking us for everything they could
                    scientifically and not allowing people who were might be get infected by
                    studying American poets or something like that. Did you find that balance?</p>
                <pb facs="0488" n="Page0488"/>
                <p>LORD: There was an element of that, although we thought it was to our advantage
                    to let Chinese students come to the U.S. and be exposed to American society no
                    matter what they were studying. We just thought it was a good idea and obviously
                    still feel that way. They heavily loaded up, somewhat understandably, on their
                    practical science, technological and economic needs, steering their student
                    exchanges toward science, engineering, and so on. So, the great bulk in that
                    period were in that area. It doesn't mean they couldn't be exposed to American
                    ideas and views and be another link in strengthening U.S.-Chinese relations. It
                    would have a beneficial impact when they got back to China. From the Chinese
                    standpoint they were taking a certain risk either that they wouldn't return or
                    that they would be semi-subversive when they did return or at least expect
                    things they had gotten used to in the United States for their professional and
                    economic abilities. This was a great transfer of technology from their
                    standpoint, learning a great deal about science and technology, so it was a
                    tradeoff that was in both sides' interests. We tried to get more students to
                    come from the U.S. to China, which was a very small number. We had Fulbright
                    exchange programs which I promoted very heavily. We also worked very hard on the
                    international visitor program of USIA which is very important where you select
                    middle level people of middle age, still with a big future but of rising
                    importance to come and spend a few weeks in the U.S., get exposed to American
                    society, go all over the United States and go back again. It was a constant
                    struggle to get people that were not just politically correct from the Chinese
                    standpoint and were not just cadre or hacks. We had mixed success on that, but
                    it was an important program, so we worked very hard in this whole area.</p>
                <p>Another objective I had, of course, was economic, and one of my highest
                    priorities was to promote American trade and investment interests. The culture
                    of the Foreign Service was just beginning to change at this point. You know we
                    have a tradition further back in our history where the average Ambassador in his
                    Embassy was saying this isn't really traditional diplomacy. I think it is fair
                    to say 20-30 years ago American businesses saw American Embassies generally as
                    not being particularly helpful. Trade and investment, of course, were less
                    crucial then in international relations. There was less globalization and less
                    of our economy depended on exports and our presence abroad than it does today.
                    But for all those reasons, the change in the importance of this element, the
                    culture has been changing clearly in the State Department. Today people are
                    rated very heavily on how well they perform economically as Ambassadors and
                    elsewhere and it is high on any Ambassador's list pretty much now.</p>
                <pb facs="0489" n="Page0489"/>
                <p>We were just making that shift generally in the culture then, and I was very much
                    in favor of that shift. I felt that Ambassadors and country teams had a distinct
                    obligation to American businesses. It would help American jobs and exports back
                    home and that was important. It would also help to strengthen the overall
                    relationship with China, so it had that benefit as well. And over time it might
                    loosen up the Chinese system. I think if you divide up my labors and it were
                    possible to quantify it, I think I spent as much time if not more on our
                    economic relationship than any other aspect during my 3 � years there. This was
                    in terms of seeing Chinese officials on investment or trade matters, opening
                    exhibits, promoting deals, lobbying for American companies, reporting on
                    economics back home, devising strategies to improve the investment and trade
                    climate. I worked extremely hard on that and spent a lot of time on it. As a
                    result, I had very good relations with the American business community. Some
                    have been critical about me in recent years because of my strong human rights
                    stand, but business interests were a major part of our effort. We had a lot of
                    economic agencies come out there. We had cabinet-level commission meetings with
                    Commerce and Treasury and Science and Technology, and a lot of cabinet and
                    sub-cabinet officials and others went back and forth. We spent a great amount of
                    time on that for the reasons I mentioned, to further our concrete interests but
                    to also strengthen the overall relationship.</p>
                <p>Q: I can understand why from strengthening the overall relationship, the more
                    American investment we had in China the better, but what is in it for the United
                    States economically, the United States per se to have a lot of McDonalds?</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, it means increased earnings for American companies, increased jobs in
                    America, increased exports from America as well as the effect of loosening up
                    broadly Chinese society, and, over time, including reforms through American
                    business practices and interactions. Over time, it could loosen up the political
                    and cultural restraints in China, but there were these very concrete American
                    economic interests involved.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you watching the situation that American jobs were essentially being lost
                    because American firms were using Chinese labor rather than American labor?</p>
                <pb facs="0490" n="Page0490"/>
                <p>LORD: It wasn't that big at that point. In fact, even today it isn't that large
                    compared to say Mexico or some other places where this happens. This was really
                    not an issue at the time. Prison labor hadn't really reared its ugly head at the
                    time although even today it doesn't involve American businesses very much, at
                    least hopefully not. Most of them are very sensitive to that. Also at that point
                    we even had modest surpluses with the Chinese. The trade was growing strongly
                    while I was there, but it is modest compared to today of course. But, it was
                    growing and we didn't have this tremendous trade imbalance at the time. So this
                    was not at my time there as sensitive issue as it is now. Now it is sensitive
                    because of the tremendous surplus the Chinese have. It has been sensitive, not
                    so much recently, because of prison labor. As for investment, it was a constant
                    battle to get the Chinese to relax their investment climate so that we could get
                    in there. So, that was a large part of our time trying to make it easy for
                    Americans to invest there as well as promoting trade and deals. We had great
                    competition from the Japanese and European businesses. As I said, we launched
                    the joint commissions back and forth, and many high level visits. I spent a lot
                    of time with businessmen briefing them at a weekly happy hour at our commercial
                    section which I would join talking with these people. I went around the country
                    and promoted American business in various places, so this was a large part of my
                    time. Whenever I went, to Shanghai or Guangzhou, even the interior, these other
                    Chinese cities, this would be high on my list with the local authorities.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, did you, were you looking over your shoulder at Japan, because in Japan
                    already we were having a tremendous trade deficit with Japan. I think it was
                    already certainly at that time, the latter half of the '80s, and the Japanese
                    had this system where it was almost impossible to penetrate; while the Japanese
                    are selling their goods to the United States, it was very difficult to sell
                    American goods to Japan. Were you looking at that and having problems of that
                    nature because of their system or were you seeing this on the horizon as we
                    moved ahead with the developing trade?</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, we kept in mind the Japanese example. We didn't want to end up in
                    China like where the Japanese market was closed and we had this large trade
                    deficit, so that general concern was in our mind. But, as I said, trade was
                    modest compared to today, and we really didn't have a trade imbalance. These
                    concerns were not acute at the time. A good part of our struggle was to get the
                    Chinese to make it easier to do business with less and less red tape and more
                    transparency and so on. Also a major concern was access to the Chinese domestic
                    market. Their emphasis particularly in those days was too narrow; they wanted
                    American technology and investment in China and exports, but they were severely
                    restricting American access to that large Chinese market. It was a constant
                    battle to get more access to China's market for U.S. companies.</p>
                <pb facs="0491" n="Page0491"/>
                <p>Q: In the '30s there was a book called Oil for the Lamps of China and there were
                    millions of customers. Now over a billion customers, and this has always been a
                    theme throughout the history of the United States, if we can only get into that
                    market. It has usually turned out to be not as profitable or as easy as was
                    thought. Can you talk about the attitude of business, the professionalism, the
                    capabilities of American business and any problems or maybe examples of what you
                    had to deal with?</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, for American businesspeople, I think, this was still relatively
                    early. The Deng Xiaoping opening and reforms started in '79, so outside
                    investment started after that including American investment. It was only a few
                    years later. Already there were frustrations for American business because some
                    had been there for a few years and weren't getting anywhere, so some were quite
                    frustrated, but on the whole I think there was a feeling, a recognition that
                    they had to have some patience. They were anxious to be in there for the long
                    run; if they got in early and earned some credit with the Chinese they might
                    have the inside track vis a vis their competitors when things got a little
                    looser. So, without being able to generalize, there was a feeling that this was
                    a little frustrating, but we have got to play for the long run. A few got
                    sufficiently frustrated that they actually pulled out while I was there, but
                    most of them stayed or started coming in.</p>
                <p>A lot depended also on local leadership. For example, I worked very hard with the
                    mayor and vice mayor of Beijing to get more projects into Beijing. At one point
                    we set a quota for the next year of 15; we got up to 23. I was reminded of this
                    at a banquet, again modest by today's standards, but they were anxious to move
                    ahead. In Tianjian in particular there was very dynamic leadership and a new
                    economic zone promoting foreign investment. Li Ruihan was the dynamic mayor
                    then, and he remains one of the top leaders today. We could make progress there.
                    In Shanghai, there was a tremendous contrast between the two mayors I dealt
                    with. The first was Jiang Zemin, now the leader of China, and he was not very
                    helpful. The climate was not very good for investment in Shanghai when I first
                    went down there in late '85-'86.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He is now the President of China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: And the American business community was very frustrated about the business
                    climate in Shanghai when I first arrived. Then Zhu Rongi, who is now the Prime
                    Minister of China, took Jiang Zemin's place as mayor and there was an immediate
                    change. For example, rather than have to go to a dozen different places to get
                    permission to start a joint venture or transaction, Zhu started one stop
                    shopping where they were all consolidated in one place. In other ways he
                    encouraged investment, and was very impressive. When I went back to Shanghai in
                    '87-'88 there was a tremendous change. The American businessmen were very
                    pleased at the progress that was being made.</p>
                <pb facs="0492" n="Page0492"/>
                <p>I think American businessmen on the whole, I'm now generalizing, were not naive.
                    Yes there was a huge potential Chinese market, and that is why they wanted to
                    get a foothold there for the future. But they also recognized this would take
                    time; there wouldn't be immediate dividends. Also it depended on what areas you
                    were dealing in. Not only geographic, but in areas where the Chinese needed
                    investment, they would make it easier for you to invest than in other areas. The
                    biggest problems were transparency, red tape, delays, ability to have access to
                    the Chinese market as opposed to being pressured just to export or to provide
                    technology. Also the hiring of the Chinese staff, the ability to get the best
                    Chinese workers and keep them. Often American business would get them, train
                    them well, and then the government would take them back and send them elsewhere.
                    So, there was control by the government over personnel working in American joint
                    ventures and businesses, and there was a constant struggle to allow American
                    business to have access to the best people and to keep them once they had them.
                    So these are some of the problems that American businesses faced, but on the
                    whole, things were moving ahead and there were some success stories.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any instead of sort of a Harvard Business School, a Beijing Business
                    School or someplace that was training to managers, or were they relying on the
                    genetic instinct of the Chinese to be good businessmen?</p>
                <p>LORD: The Chinese do have a genetic instinct for great entrepreneurship, but they
                    also had a terrible Communist economic system and state enterprises and all the
                    other elements that were holding back their economy even in those days. We had
                    one specific program in Dalian, an institute where we trained Chinese managers.
                    We brought them over to the United States, That was a very positive force; we
                    worked hard on that. It was run by the Commerce Department. Secretary Shultz on
                    one of his two trips when I was there, went to visit that institute. Obviously,
                    individual American joint ventures and businessmen were helping train Chinese as
                    they worked together with them. The Chinese had an International University of
                    Economics and Business. Which Bette and I both addressed. This was going on as
                    well. But, this was still pretty early compared to where we are now in the 1990s
                    in terms of Chinese learning management skills, developing entrepreneurship, and
                    even loosening up their system and moving it toward a capitalist operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">(Bernkopf Tucker): Did you have any trouble at that time
                        witdual use technologies? Was that an issue yet?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0493" n="Page0493"/>
                <p>LORD: These are technologies that we would export that could be used for either
                    military or civilian purposes, and the issue is that if you export it, you have
                    got to make sure that it is used for the reasons it is supposed to be used for.
                    I do recall that we were constantly trying to expand the list of exports we
                    thought we could safely export to make more money for Americans and more jobs
                    without endangering national security, including a looser definition of
                    computers because computers have advanced so far that we felt that some could
                    now be safely sent to China. I don't recall any of this being a huge issue. We
                    did point out to the Chinese that our exports of dual use technology were
                    related to their performance, and this echoes today, of how they were dealing
                    with Iran and Saudi Arabia on missiles. There was an implicit tradeoff that we
                    managed on one of Shultz's trips or Secretary of Defense Carlucci's trips.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Carlucci was Secretary of Defense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: To loosen up on certain areas of exports, not on national security items
                    under export control, but rather dual use items in exchange for better Chinese
                    performance in sending missiles to the Middle East. It did not have the kind of
                    controversy that we have now in the 1990s.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: You mentioned several times and I didn't bring it up
                    earlier, but the co-question of missile proliferation in the Middle East. How
                    did you go about dealing with the Chinese on that very difficult issue?</p>
                <p>LORD: As I recall, there were two major issues here, again we won't be precise on
                    chronology. One was they sent Silkworms to Iran. That was a significant problem,
                    and we worked very hard on it. We finally got them to agree not to send any
                    more. They claimed they never had sent any, but we got them to agree that while
                    they never sent any, they wouldn't do so again! Shultz worked hard on this, and
                    we worked very hard on this over time, but I don't have any precise dates. That
                    was one area. Then there was another area when their Foreign Minister, Wu, was
                    visiting Washington in the late '80s, and even as he was there, we got reports
                    of their sending missiles to Saudi Arabia, and we got them to clamp down on
                    that. There was also still ambiguous activity with Pakistan with respect to the
                    nuclear program. That was why a nuclear agreement we negotiated with China was
                    never sent forth to Congress until last October (1998) when Jiang Zemin visited
                    the United States. The other issue that has some resonance now was Chinese
                    rockets launching American satellites. While I was there the Challenger blew up,
                    an American tragedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was an orbital shuttle.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0494" n="Page0494"/>
                <p>LORD: That was a tragedy obviously in personal terms, but also a setback for our
                    whole launching capabilities. Our satellite industry wasn't able then, even as
                    it is not today, to have enough launches of American capability so they could
                    get their satellites up. Plus we felt in general orbiting satellites for
                    communications purposes would feed into the whole communications information
                    revolution and it would have a positive impact on China. Above all, we wanted to
                    help our satellite makers, but we also had to work out certain limits so we
                    wouldn't unfairly hurt our own satellite launchers. They could still do some. We
                    had certain quotas we were shooting for with the Chinese. This was a major
                    agreement we worked out when Secretary Carlucci visited China, I'm quite sure in
                    1988. We are hearing about it today (1998) for Chinese rockets to launch
                    American satellites. We had several conditions we worked on even after the
                    Carlucci visit. One was the number of launches so we wouldn't hurt American
                    industry. Another was tight controls and inspections so there wouldn't be any
                    security breach. I think there were one or two other conditions.</p>
                <p>On missile proliferation, generally we had serious problems on Iran and Saudi
                    Arabia as I mentioned. Along with Tibet which heated up while I was there - we
                    will get back into that - those were probably the most serious issues we had
                    while I was there, as well as the general Chinese restraints on political and
                    cultural freedom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">(Bernkopf Tucker): What kind of arguments did you make to
                        thChinese to try to persuade them not to do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: It is not unlike what we have been doing in recent years on proliferation
                    issues. You use a combination of sticks and carrots. We didn't have in place as
                    many sanctions then as we do now, so we didn't have any sanctions we could
                    impose as I recall. The Chinese were interested in getting more technology,
                    including dual use technology. For commercial reasons we were interested in this
                    as well, so we would use that, saying in effect if you behave yourself on
                    missile proliferation, we can do more on exporting dual use technology. So there
                    was that trade off. We also tried to appeal to their geopolitical interests,
                    saying instability in the Near East and the Persian Gulf was not in their
                    interest either. Now that argument has much greater weight today when they have
                    to import oil themselves. They want stability. We also made the point that
                    arming Iran with Silkworm missiles that could hit American ships was a serious
                    problem for U.S.-Chinese relations in terms of American domestic and
                    congressional opinion. Resentment over this could seriously set back the
                    U.S.-China relationship.</p>
                <p>So the incentives were more economic and technological cooperation, avoiding the
                    dangers of hurting American domestic support for the relationship, and
                    geopolitical arguments. Now, that had to be balanced off with their need to make
                    money, the PLA in particular, and their desire to have an influence in the
                    region. It was not easy going. There was a lot of tough work over many months by
                    us at the Embassy and in Washington, but we did make progress on both Iran and
                    Saudi Arabia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Was it more difficult to argue the case about Saudi
                    Arabia since that is an American ally? Did you have to approach it differently
                    than Iran?</p>
                <p>LORD: I guess it was somewhat more difficult. I remember we hit them when foreign
                    Minister Wu was in Washington in '87 or '88, around that period. Shultz had a
                    barbecue at his house in Washington. We took this up with Wu. It was the first
                    time this had come up, just before Wu had arrived. He got hit also by the
                    National Security Advisor, Colin Powell as well, not only that evening I
                    believe, but in his office the next day. I think Reagan also referred to it but
                    not as precisely as Powell. I don't recall. We had to appeal to different
                    interests. On the one hand the Saudis were an ally. But we thought it was
                    destabilizing to have missile proliferation in the Middle East generally. And of
                    course, we had the Israeli connection which we were concerned about. Even then
                    the Chinese had some contacts with Israel including military supplies and this
                    grew all the time. So, even though they had a position in the Middle East,
                    interests with the Palestinians and the Arabs, they had some fish to fry with
                    the Israelis as well. We appealed on instability in the region and the impact on
                    American opinion.</p>
                <p>I'll move on to some other elements in our relations. One specific thing that I
                    was very happy with, and that I worked very hard on, was the Peace Corps. Before
                    I went out to China in 1985, I remember agreeing with the director of the Peace
                    Corps, Loret Ruppe, that this would be a goal. I just felt it was a great
                    program generally and it would be very helpful to get it into China. I worked
                    hard on that for my entire tenure. The Chinese still had residual suspicions
                    that the Peace Corps might be a front for spying. It had, they thought, some
                    historical baggage, and they didn't even want the name Peace Corps name to be
                    used. It had to be, from the Chinese translation, “American Volunteers” or
                    something like that. I worked very hard on this for several years. One of the
                    last things we accomplished was to sign an agreement letting American teachers
                    go into Sichuan Province just before I left as part of a 3-3 � year effort.</p>
                <p>By the way, I took Chinese lessons my first few months in China and picked up
                    some phrases for evidence of my efforts. But it was impossible, part-time, to
                    make real progress.</p>
                <pb facs="0496" n="Page0496"/>
                <p>Another major objective of mine was to build up support in the United States for
                    the relationship, in a hard-hearted way and not coming across as being infected
                    with clientitis or being naive about the Chinese. I was stressing concerns about
                    human rights and missile proliferation and Tibet, whatever the issue was. I
                    worked hard to get not only government officials who were already generally
                    committed to this, but also members of Congress. I was anxious to get as many of
                    them to China as possible, particularly conservatives and skeptics of the
                    relationship. They could reinforce our positions to the Chinese with their own
                    points. And they could learn more about the benefits of our relations. Indeed
                    the very first high level delegation to China after I arrived as Ambassador
                    included two or three Senators who had voted against my confirmation (the vote
                    was 87-7). They subsequently became strong supporters of mine, e.g., Senator
                    Hatch of Utah.</p>
                <p>I would go back to the U.S. every few months. I think Ambassadors as a matter of
                    policy should do this for a variety of reasons. One of course, is to push issues
                    along in the bureaucracy that are hung up and you can only get it done by
                    lobbying directly at high levels in Washington and moving things along. Second
                    getting the mood back there, getting a sense both in the government and
                    generally the political mood of how things are going so you can relay that to
                    the Chinese and also keep them in mind as you operate back in China. I would see
                    as many congressmen and Senators as I could when I got back. They are always
                    tough to get appointments with. I would get with the academic experts and
                    compare notes with them, talk with a lot of business people and get their
                    perspectives on doing business in China and how we could help them. What their
                    frustrations and goals were. I would also relay my impressions of China to
                    various audiences. Give speeches to various groups outlining our goals with
                    China and building up support for the relationship as well as backgrounders with
                    the press and on the air interviews. I remember on one trip, I did a real blitz
                    because it was the anniversary of normalization of the Shanghai Communiqu� or
                    one of those dates. I remember interviews with the New York Times and the
                    Washington Post. I was on the McNeil- Lehrer Show, and NBC Today when I went
                    back.</p>
                <pb facs="0497" n="Page0497"/>
                <p>Another objective was to keep in touch with the American scene, move the
                    bureaucracy along on issues, also plan upcoming trips. I'd be back before Shultz
                    coming over, or the Secretary of Defense, and try to strategize the trip, and to
                    keep in touch with America and what was going on. Also I went back several times
                    to accompany high level Chinese visitors. I already had lots of cabinet and
                    other people coming to China and eventually President Bush toward the end of my
                    stay. In turn, we had high level Chinese visitors going to the U.S. I
                    accompanied them to not only Washington and New York but to other places around
                    the country. Several high level Chinese included a couple of Vice Premiers,
                    Foreign Minister Wu (February 1988), and soon to be president Yang Shangkung
                    (May 1987). We went to various places like Minneapolis, New Orleans, North
                    Carolina, Texas, and California, not to mention New York and Washington. This
                    was very useful. It was fun to see America through other eyes, traveling with
                    the Chinese. What they saw had to impress them with our strengths. It gave me a
                    chance to have access continually with these high level leaders and establish
                    relations with them and try to influence them, to try to make some points and
                    get American perspectives and interests advanced in our discussions with them.
                    It was useful to go back there and advance the relationship in these ways. On
                    one of these trips, sadly, in May 1986, my father passed away in Florida. I had
                    skipped a meeting with Secretary Shultz, with his blessing, to see him a last
                    time a few days earlier.</p>
                <p>(Bernkopf Tucker): Can I interrupt for just a second because it follows from what
                    you were saying. Were you able during this period to form personal relationships
                    with the Chinese leadership. How approachable were they? Did you only see them
                    in these formal occasions?</p>
                <p>LORD: I will go over some of the Chinese leaders and my impressions.First a
                    couple of other points.</p>
                <p>I have said that my three and a half years were the best ever since the 1971-2
                    opening in terms of bilateral relations, and that's true. But, of course, we had
                    problems all the time in this mixed relationship. Probably the rockiest time was
                    the last three months or so of 1987. We hit the Chinese hard on their giving
                    Silkworm missiles to the Saudis and on Tibet. They hit us on Tibet and a
                    Congressional Record resolution and canceled some exchanges. In my usual year
                    end personal review cable I set forth a strategy, including visits and
                    exchanges, for improving the situation. I also planned to step up my own travels
                    around China. In early 1988 the situation improved.One thing I put great stress
                    on was personal cables, not overdoing it, but setting out in writing every few
                    months my own impressions of what was going on in China as well as key issues
                    and how to advance them. So I would do this and make sure it got to the
                    Secretary and National Security Advisor and others. I took great interest in
                    doing this personally as well as working carefully on the usual Embassy scene
                    setters. I did this personally to prepare visitors on key trips as well, either
                    editing drafts of my staff or doing them personally. So I spent a lot of work on
                    some of these personal notes. You did it selectively so you wouldn't wear out
                    your welcome. I got some very good feedback on that.</p>
                <pb facs="0498" n="Page0498"/>
                <p>We took very seriously visitors from Washington whether executive branch or
                    congressional or actors like Gregory Peck and Charlton Heston or Billy Graham or
                    top level business people. It didn't matter who it was, we went out of our way
                    to give them as good briefings as we could. Particularly when American
                    government leaders came we would give them specific scene-setters. This was
                    standard in our Embassy. I put great stress on it both to help them do a better
                    job when they got to China but also frankly to burnish the reputation of the
                    Embassy. I think, without being self serving, we got a very good reputation with
                    our briefings once they got there as well as our scene setters in advance. We
                    took very seriously briefing these visitors in advance as they set out to do
                    their business and frankly both in writing and verbally we did very thoughtful
                    briefings.</p>
                <p>Finally as Ambassador I was concerned about staff morale. I did believe in
                    working people hard and pursuing excellence as the main goal, but we had a
                    variety of ways to engage the staff and help morale. We had monthly staff
                    meetings at the house where spouses would be invited. Very small lunches with
                    junior or mid level officers that you don't see in the normal course of events.
                    Tremendous engagement with Marines even to the point of playing basketball every
                    Saturday and softball every Sunday. We had our Marines picked as the best unit
                    in Asia a couple of times running out of all detachments out there. I would make
                    an effort to write personal notes to the staff on cables to show I was keeping
                    on top of what they were doing. I made sure that my secretary or staff would
                    keep me posted on any personal developments so that I could weigh in whether it
                    was a birth or death in the family or whatever. We took that quite seriously as
                    well. Now, these are some of the objectives I had as Ambassador.</p>
                <p>Related to this was my attention to our four consulates - Shanghai, Guangdong,
                    Shenyang, and Chengdu. I visited all of them several times. I, of course, would
                    meet with the American and Chinese staffs and have personnel accompany me in
                    meetings and travels. I sought their views and paid attention to morale, just as
                    I did of the embassy. I worked hard, together with my deputy and others, to
                    improve the poor working conditions, housing, the security, the schooling, etc -
                    both at the consulates and in Beijing. We pressed the Chinese hard on this and
                    travel restrictions and I/we spent much time on these and property issues and
                    made some progress. I also met frequently and Bette and I socialized with our
                    Chinese employees in Beijing and elsewhere. Their morale was important to
                    us.</p>
                <pb facs="0499" n="Page0499"/>
                <p>Another thing I should mention is human rights. Human rights has been a thorn in
                    our side ever since we opened up with China. It has become more acute, most
                    people agree, since Tiananmen Square and the images we had of that massacre.
                    Even in those days though, it was one of the big problems in our relationship. I
                    felt then, as I do now, that this is an important issue in and of itself and in
                    terms of building American and Congressional support for the relationship. But I
                    also felt there were many other interests in China and no one issue can hold the
                    whole relationship hostage. That has always been my view. I raised human rights
                    lots of times. We took it seriously, we raised it, and we pressed it, whether it
                    was freedom of expression or Tibet. But, it was not as high profile an issue as
                    it has been in the 1990s. It did get quite high profile in Tibet where there was
                    tough repression of demonstrations. It was a problem, but it was not the
                    dominant issue. I will get back to this later because I want to give a real
                    vignette about the experience Bette and I had on democracy at Beijing
                    University. While we were there human rights was a continuing problem, but it
                    didn't dominate the relationship. It wasn't as high profile as it is today since
                    Tiananmen Square.</p>
                <p>One problem, it's not strictly human rights, but having to do with journalists an
                    issue that came up on several occasions. For example, I was at Chengdu with my
                    wife and son. We were about to launch on a brief summer vacation traveling
                    through Kunming and Guilin. My first day there I got word that John Burns who
                    was a New York Times correspondent although he was a Canadian citizen actually,
                    had been detained by the Chinese because he had traveled in areas that he didn't
                    have permission to travel in. My instinct told me this was a possible bombshell
                    since he was a New York Times reporter although he was not an American citizen.
                    I immediately dropped my vacation and raced back to Beijing and worked very hard
                    with the Chinese. We were visited by Abe Rosenthal and another man from the New
                    York Times editorial board on this issue. It was very tense because there was
                    some concern they might actually charge Burns with trespassing or violating
                    security. In the Chinese so called justice system, once you are charged, you are
                    guilty. So, if he would have been charged, he probably would have been jailed.
                    He was being detained. We worked extremely hard, much harder than the Canadians
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask about the Canadians.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, we tried cooperating on this but they were nowhere near as concerned
                    about their own citizen as we were. We got a lot of credit with Rosenthal and
                    others for the efforts we made. I pulled out all the stops and we finally got
                    Burns expelled and not detained. In the process, of course, we lost a tremendous
                    observer of the Chinese scene. Ironically he was writing an article for the
                    Times that was positive about Deng's reforms in the countryside. But, in so
                    doing, he was deliberately going to off limit areas without getting permission.
                    He was on a motorcycle accompanied by a young man named Ed McNally, a very
                    bright lawyer from Yale who helped me with some July 4 speeches.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What arguments were you using with the Chinese
                        authorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: The main argument was of course the impact on our relations. You take the
                    premier American newspaper, you jail that reporter, it is going to have a
                    devastating impact. Secondly, he clearly wasn't spying. I don't recall how we
                    fuzzed up how much he knew about restrictions, but he could not have been not
                    spying. His motive was journalism. I made the point that he was telling, he was
                    in fact about to write a positive story about what was going on, and he just
                    wanted to see as much of China as he could, the innocence of what he was doing.
                    He limited his self confession; he violated certain restrictions, but this was
                    for journalistic reasons, not spying reasons. So, we worked very hard and
                    successfully on that.</p>
                <p>There was another American with the AP who was kicked out a few months later from
                    Guandong. The journalists generally were always frustrated by the surveillance
                    they had in China. The longer they stay there, the more cynical they get about
                    the Chinese and human rights in general. In fact, they were nervous about making
                    contact with students or dissidents or intellectuals because they might get them
                    in trouble. Their phones and probably apartments were bugged, and they always
                    had to get permission to travel places. There were a lot of frustrations there.
                    It was a tough place to do business even though it was fascinating in terms of
                    substance. There were several meetings where I met with them both Americans and
                    correspondents in general, and they were pressing for even stronger U.S. actions
                    including retaliating by kicking out Chinese reporters from the U.S. and so on.
                    I think they felt I lobbied as hard as I could with the Chinese on restrictions
                    of the press and specifically on these cases. This was a source of tension. I
                    just mention this in the general area of human rights although it was not
                    exactly the same thing as Tibet or dissidents. I'll do Tibet a little more
                    later.</p>
                <p>In addition, I spent a lot of time with resident, as well as American,
                    journalists, mostly on background to explain our policies and impressions of
                    China. Every few weeks my key officers and I would meet with the resident
                    journalists to brief them and answer their questions.</p>
                <p>Among the vivid memories Bette and I have of our China tenure. The first American
                    ship visits to China since 1949 - October 1986 in Qingdao. Going to a Chinese
                    Catholic church on Christmas Eve, 1986 I believe - it was totally packed. I
                    introduced the Superbowl on Chinese television on March 9, 1986 - sadly a
                    lopsided, dull victory for the Bears over the Patriots. Honor guards for high
                    level American military visitors. Countless banquets in the Great Hall of the
                    People and the Guest House. Travels all around the country. Parties at the
                    residence with Chinese friends. Bette and I won a diplomatic tennis tournament
                    and my son, Win, and I got to the finals of men's doubles. I also won a men's
                    doubles diplomatic tournament. The prize was a week's vacation in Yugoslavia
                    which I never took.XIX. AMBASSADOR TO CHINA - CHINESE LEADERS, POLITICAL ISSUES
                    (1985-1989)</p>
                <pb facs="0501" n="Page0501"/>
                <p>Q: You were going to talk about your impression of the Chinese leadership both
                    individuals and its collective ability, how you appraised it at that time,
                    because its collective ability was tested just after you left.</p>
                <p>LORD: I had really very good access to Chinese leaders in the sense that we had
                    so many visits and high level visitors during my period, and they would always
                    see most of the top Chinese leaders. It is the Chinese style when they host
                    people of cabinet level or above that the American visitor should not only see
                    the Foreign Minister and his/her cabinet counterpart, but also Vice Premiers,
                    the Premier himself, the Party Secretary or the President or some combination. I
                    had a lot of impressions from those meetings and I had meetings of my own. We
                    had other high level visitors like Kissinger coming back, old friends, e.g.
                    Jimmy Carter, who would also have meetings with these people.</p>
                <p>As for Deng Xiaoping I don't remember how many times we saw him but of course he
                    was less frequent. Even then he wasn't as accessible as some of the others. I
                    must have met him a dozen times at least, probably more, while I was there. I
                    had seen him on many other occasions before I was ambassador. I saw Zhao Ziyang
                    frequently. He was premier and than Party Secretary while I was there. He took
                    over the latter job from Hu Yaobang, who was kicked out in early '87. I probably
                    saw Li Peng as much as any. He was the Premier from '87 onwards. He would see
                    American corporate executives who were visiting as well as American leaders, so
                    I saw a great deal of him. Jiang Zemin I saw as mayor of Shanghai. He didn't
                    have an important role in Beijing by the time I left so I don't recall seeing
                    that much of him after the Shanghai tenure of the first couple of years that I
                    was there. I saw quite a bit of Yang Shangkun, who became the President of
                    China. Also Zhu Rongji, who was the mayor of Shanghai the last couple of years I
                    was there, so I only saw him in the Shanghai context. I also met Hu Yaobang on a
                    couple of occasions, once with Brzezinski. And, of course, I saw the Foreign
                    Minister and other Cabinet officials countless times, also governors and mayors
                    in the provinces, many of them future leaders in Beijing.</p>
                <p>The interesting thing is that we are now talking about 10-15 years that have
                    passed and many of these players remain central. Jiang Zemin is President and
                    Party Secretary of the country. Zhu Rongji is Prime Minister and Li Peng still
                    has an important role as NPC Chairman and just left as Prime Minister. Zhao
                    Ziyang is under house arrest. Yang Shangkun has essentially departed from the
                    scene. Now some impressions. You have got to remember that working since the
                    Kissinger-Nixon years I was used to Mao Zedong and Zhou En-lai and they were
                    tough acts to follow. I said in an earlier transcript Deng Xiaoping was not that
                    impressive in our first encounters in 1974-'76, but was certainly more
                    impressive by the time we had breakfast with him, Kissinger and myself, in 1979
                    when he visited the United States. We saw him together when we visited China a
                    few months later. By then he clearly was an impressive human being.</p>
                <pb facs="0502" n="Page0502"/>
                <p>There were some constant themes in the meetings with him. He was pretty
                    consistent. First, very self confident and lively. Not as stiff as many Chinese
                    leaders. His general habits are well known. He would smoke a great deal and
                    occasionally use a spittoon. He was very short, you know his feet hardly reached
                    the floor, but he was a commanding presence. He always wanted to talk about big
                    issues, geopolitical as well as the bilateral relationship. He would never get
                    down into details. He felt that was not consistent with his position. He had
                    given up all his titles. Even then he was grooming his successors. He was
                    clearly in charge, number one, but on a day to day basis and on greeting people
                    he wasn't that involved. He was already phasing down some of his active
                    involvement. He was Chairman of the Board, strategist. He would give the general
                    lines of policy and leave the details to his subordinates, the Party Secretary,
                    the Premier, etc. Generally during most of the visits where you had a visiting
                    cabinet official like the Secretary of State or Defense or from economic
                    agencies, he would come toward the end and would usually be the good cop. If
                    there were mixed messages to be sent in the course of a visit, some of the
                    tougher ones would be sent by the Premier or the Foreign Minister, whereas Deng
                    generally would emphasize the positive. He seldom gave us unpleasant news; it
                    was usually a very cordial meeting. His strategic discourses depended on the
                    skill of his interlocutor. With somebody like Kissinger of course, they would
                    clearly be on a geopolitical plane. People usually felt good about him and his
                    relationship because he was usually playing a positive role in his meetings. I'm
                    sure he orchestrated the meetings so if there were some tough messages to get
                    across, he would have made sure it would have been done by then by subordinates,
                    and it would be done. It wasn't his role.</p>
                <pb facs="0503" n="Page0503"/>
                <p>He was very much dedicated to U.S.-Chinese relations. He had a lot to do with
                    improving them and clearly wanted to keep that moving ahead despite tensions. He
                    wanted to emphasize that in our meetings, and he always did. He wanted to look
                    ahead as well as backwards, and he always used a historical and strategic
                    context. In almost every meeting there were cracks by him against the Russians
                    and usually against the Japanese as well. I remember my final meeting with him
                    was with President Bush in February, 1989. He talked about Russian and Japanese
                    history and what they had done to China. Clearly he was making a point that
                    whatever China's near term improvement in ties with those countries, as he
                    looked ahead, they were still strategic concerns for China, and therefore major
                    reasons for maintaining good relations with the U.S. So, on geopolitics, he was
                    very skillful and interested in that. He always thought in a strategic and long
                    term context, and he was very strong on the U.S.-Chinese bilateral relationship
                    but wouldn't get into detail. He would talk a good deal about Chinese economic
                    reforms and opening up to the outside world. His formulations on human rights
                    would be minimal, but emphasizing as all Chinese leaders did, the need for
                    stability which was a code word for them for political control or even
                    repression, as they opened up generally to the outside world and they moved
                    ahead with economic reforms. It was the traditional Chinese communist excuse
                    that they need more control to maintain stability in this vast country and the
                    challenges they faced.As for my own record on him, I actually wrote a pretty
                    good piece when he died; I got it done too late to get it published. I think
                    there will be a mixed historical verdict on him. I have a mixed verdict on him.
                    The good news is, of course, and none of this is overly revolutionary, he was
                    the architect of the opening after the Cultural Revolution, opening China to the
                    world and what all that means, including economic reforms and moving them into a
                    freer economic society. Secondly he was crucial in improving U.S.-Chinese
                    relations, from normalization all the way up. Even when there were tensions, he
                    kept emphasizing the positive. He has helped the material lot of many Chinese
                    citizens. For all this he deserves considerable credit. He was a tough customer
                    who rebounded several times from tough experiences and came back from the
                    Cultural Revolution, and other setbacks. These are positive items and he
                    deserves credit there.</p>
                <pb facs="0504" n="Page0504"/>
                <p>There are clear black marks as well. He was always conservative on the political
                    level, even though at times even when we were there, things were loosening up
                    somewhat. His general pattern was one of firm control on politics. After all he
                    sacked Hu Yaobang, the party Secretary General in early 1987, partly because he
                    felt that Hu was too liberal on political reforms, too liberal on issues like
                    Tibet. Maybe also he didn't like Hu's freewheeling, self-confident style. There
                    was also the element of feeding him to the conservatives who were upset about
                    the student demonstrations in Shanghai in December-January of 1986-87. So, Deng
                    fed Hu Yaobang to the wolves as a result of that unrest to maintain a collective
                    balance to his leadership. He also did it out of concern for Hu Yaobang's
                    liberal instincts on politics and his freewheeling style. After all, Deng
                    Xiaoping had been the henchman for Mao in the anti-rightist campaign way back in
                    the late '50s. With all his positive aspects on economic reform and opening to
                    the world and U.S.-Chinese relations, you get a consistent trend of political
                    conservatism and repression. He not only dumped Hu but also his successor as
                    Party Chairman, Zhao Ziyang, in 1989 because the latter was too friendly toward
                    the demonstrators at Tiananmen Square. Li Peng was the heavy during the 1989
                    massacre because he declared martial law; he was out in front. The fact is it
                    was clearly a Deng Xiaoping decision to attack, fully unwarranted in my view. We
                    will come back to that. And he sacked Zhao Ziyang in the process, so that is two
                    political reform-type party secretaries that he dropped.</p>
                <p>Peng will be remembered for the Tiananmen Square massacre and general political
                    repression as well as for the positive things and will come out with a mixed
                    verdict.</p>
                <p>Hu Yaobang and I met only a couple of times, and the portrait of him that is in
                    my wife's book Legacies, however brief, is very vivid of him. He was
                    unpredictable. He was somebody who really was spontaneous and he wasn't
                    scripted. A very active and physically small person. I think he was the only one
                    who was smaller than Deng Xiaoping. Clearly, although we probably elevated this
                    in retrospect, he was for a looser political system. I have talked to many
                    Tibetans who felt he was very enlightened on Tibet and indeed he was trying to
                    loosen up the repression in Tibet. There is documentation for that. Clearly he
                    felt the need for political reform as well as economic reform. He was pushing
                    the envelope. The reason he was sacked by Deng on January 16, 1987 was the
                    feeling among the conservatives that he was encouraging these trends.</p>
                <pb facs="0505" n="Page0505"/>
                <p>Zhao Ziyang now looks very good to reformers and those of us who want to see a
                    better political system in China, and he was in the Tiananmen Square episode
                    arguing for restraint, not using the Army, meeting the students halfway. He was
                    sacked for this. He has kept up on occasion from his house arrest his drumbeat
                    for the need for political reform. He has come out dramatically twice in the
                    last six months on the eve of summits with letters to the leadership calling for
                    a reversal on the official verdict on Tiananmen Square. When I was there he was
                    trying to separate the party from the government, trying to loosen up the
                    political system, not dramatically, but pushing the envelope. So, you would have
                    to put him on that side of the spectrum along with Hu Yaobang. Zhao was very
                    intelligent, very smooth, very impressive in his meetings, generally on the
                    friendly side in dealing with Americans, private citizens or official visitors.
                    He gave a sense of great confidence. He was a good example of the new kind of
                    leadership in China where they earn their leadership credentials as technocrats,
                    economic experts, pragmatists. They get things done, particularly in the
                    economic area. He was proven in the provinces because he had been governor of
                    Guangdong and Sichuan. He was impressive in many ways.</p>
                <p>Li Peng is everyone's scapegoat. Li Peng deserves a negative verdict from
                    Americans. There has been enough proof in his demeanor, the way he has acted in
                    meetings, from intelligence reports, and from reports from other Chinese, that
                    he is generally more suspicious of the U.S., more conservative on economic
                    reforms, certainly very tight on political issues. He not only declared martial
                    law but believed in putting down the students and others in Tiananmen Square.
                    Generally he has caused us trouble on issues. Therefore, he has not been a
                    positive force in U.S.-China relations. On the other hand, he is enough of a
                    pragmatist to recognize that China needs the U.S., particularly for technology,
                    trade, investment etc. He is an engineer by background and clearly sees the need
                    for the relationship for those reasons. Nevertheless, with his Soviet background
                    and his general suspicion of the U.S., particularly our human rights policy
                    subverting their political system generally, he has been a restraint on
                    U.S.-Chinese relations. Probably tougher on Taiwan and some other issues and
                    conservative on economic reform, certainly very conservative on political
                    issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his position while you were there, and what is
                        hiposition now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I guess he was Vice Premier when I was first there and became Premier. I
                    don't have the timing on this. He was Vice Premier when Hu Yaobang was sacked in
                    early '87. Zhao Ziyang had been Prime Minister until then. Zhao moved up to be
                    Party Secretary and then Li Peng was appointed Prime Minister. He was Prime
                    Minister about the last year and a half while I was there.</p>
                <p>(Bernkopf Tucker): I think maybe, I'm not sure, but when you first got there, he
                    may have still been with the state education commission.</p>
                <pb facs="0506" n="Page0506"/>
                <p>LORD: He might have had a cabinet level position on the economic side. He was an
                    engineer, there is nothing wrong with engineers, but he was not one for
                    conceptual discussion, geopolitical discussion. He would sort of take practical
                    stands on issues. He would sometimes lecture us on human rights or Tibet or
                    Taiwan or perhaps our building up of Japan as dangerous. These kinds of negative
                    things would come in. Generally he was the bad cop and Deng and (recently) Jiang
                    Zemin were good cops. It doesn't mean Li was totally hostile and there were some
                    meetings where he was friendlier than others. But generally visiting business
                    people, or high level people from previous U.S. governments or cabinet level
                    officials from the current government, most of them came away not enamored of Li
                    Peng, either his personality or the substance of his thoughts. He could be quite
                    rough. This continued during the Clinton years when we had dealings with
                    him.</p>
                <p>One example of his rather limited approach. I was initially impressed that he
                    arranged to have Lee Iacocca (the chairman of Chrysler Corporation), who then
                    was a big hero bringing Chrysler back, to a small dinner at a restaurant. In
                    terms of protocol he didn't have to do this. It was the kind of guy he would see
                    in the Great Hall. But he invited him to have a small dinner, just Lee Iacocca,
                    myself, and a couple of the Chinese. I thought, maybe I have misjudged this man.
                    He knows enough to look at a person like Iacocca who has got all this experience
                    particularly in a market economy, and bringing a failing company back, and to
                    see how it could apply to China. Almost the entire evening, however, was devoted
                    to Li Peng's talking about Chinese advancement and in particular the
                    transportation area, citing the number of kilometers of roads that were being
                    built and the number of automobiles they would have one day and other items like
                    that. He just wasted the evening. He didn't draw Iacocca out on anything of
                    significance. So, this sort of demonstrated Li's limits. Now, having said that,
                    the man obviously had more staying power than I gave him credit for. After his
                    martial law and direct negative involvement in Tiananmen Square in 1989, I
                    didn't think he would last very long. But he served as Prime Minister until the
                    Constitution made him retire just a year or two ago. He clearly is head of the
                    conservative camp and with Jiang Zemin's and Deng's general approach to a more
                    collective leadership and the need for balance plus his own bureaucratic
                    alliances he maintained his position, much to my surprise.</p>
                <pb facs="0507" n="Page0507"/>
                <p>Yang Shangkung became President of China. We first of took notice of him when he
                    came to the United States. We had visitors going back and forth. We would have
                    the Secretary of State or Defense or others come, but we also moved to get
                    Chinese to go to the U.S. I mentioned earlier the four trips that I went on, one
                    of which was with Yang. At some point, we wondered who would be the next
                    visitor. We weren't at summit levels at that point, at least visiting the U.S.
                    We were running out of Vice Premiers, and the Chinese suggested Yang who was a
                    military man. In fact, he had been Mao's Chief of Staff, been on the Long March,
                    across the grasslands three times. His wife of almost 60 years had just died a
                    couple of years beforehand. She had been on the Long March with him. I think he
                    was Vice Chairman of the Military Commission at the time; he wasn't President
                    yet. When he was suggested as the next visitor by the Chinese, we didn't oppose
                    it, but we were puzzled. They went out of their way, the Chinese and the Foreign
                    Ministry and their Ambassador back here, to explain how important this guy was
                    and to be sure he had a good trip. We didn't quite know why, but it turned out
                    he was very close to Deng, going back to the Long March. He was to become
                    President. He was a major political figure and remained that for several
                    years.</p>
                <p>I got along with Yang extremely well when I accompanied him back in the United
                    States in May 1987. He asked me for advice on the various audiences he would
                    deal with, whether it was meeting with the President or a business group or the
                    press. I would ride around in cars with him as well as be with him between
                    meetings. After meetings, he would ask me afterwards how he did on questions and
                    answers. Very appreciative of my advice, had a good sense of humor, spoke
                    movingly about the Long March. We could never quite figure out where he came out
                    on some of the issues. He clearly backed Deng Xiaoping and the reforms and the
                    opening, but to this day it is not clear what his position is on political
                    reform. It is probably fairly conservative. People aren't quite sure where he
                    came out on Tiananmen Square; certainly he didn't oppose the use of force, but
                    there is some feeling that he wasn't in the forefront on that like say Li
                    Peng.</p>
                <p>Jiang Zemin is obviously the most important today as we speak. He was not that
                    important when I was there and as I say as mayor of Shanghai was much less
                    impressive than his successor, Zhu Rongji, who is now Prime Minister. He did not
                    strike us then as a man of tremendous gravitas. He was friendly, he was jolly,
                    and he would like to show off his English and his affinity for some Western
                    culture and classics, but didn't seem entirely serious. I would not have picked
                    him as the future leader of China. But he has lasted, and he has been on a roll
                    for the last couple of years - his visit to the U.S., Clinton's visit to China,
                    the 15th Party Congress solidifying his position, has been in power now for many
                    years, first de facto then de jure, and the return of Hong Kong. He has done
                    quite well and is clever enough to have someone like Zhu Rongji out there doing
                    the hard economic reforms. If they work, Jiang basks in success. If they fail,
                    he has a scapegoat. He has balanced off the conservatives and the moderates. He
                    has been quite impressive, but none of this I would have predicted.</p>
                <pb facs="0508" n="Page0508"/>
                <p>(Bernkopf Tucker): Doesn't he get launched in part because of how well he handled
                    Shanghai during the Tiananmen period in '89? Also maybe you could comment on the
                    importance of Shanghai for producing political leaders.</p>
                <p>LORD: That is a good point. When Zhu took his place as mayor of Shanghai, Jiang
                    moved up to be Party Secretary and was in charge during the Tiananmen Square
                    demonstrations. There was a bloody outcome in Beijing. There were very large
                    demonstrations in Shanghai, but no blood was shed there and Jiang and his
                    cohorts did handle this skillfully. I don't recall offhand whether Zhu was
                    involved in this skillful handling or not, but Jiang certainly gets the credit
                    for having defused very tense and large demonstrations in Shanghai without the
                    kind of bloody put-down that you had in Beijing. That did capture people's
                    attention. It also protects him somewhat about a reversal of the verdict on
                    Tiananmen Square. Although it may not happen anytime soon, it will happen in my
                    view. I think that did help move him.</p>
                <p>Clearly Shanghai has been a source of Chinese dynamism and leadership for good or
                    for ill for many decades. That is where the Cultural Revolution started. You
                    have, of course, Jiang from Shanghai, the number one guy. Now the number two guy
                    Zhu from Shanghai. The Foreign Ministry for decades, not so much now, but
                    certainly when I was there during the '80s was dominated by key people from
                    Shanghai, at least the American handlers. In any event, this has been a source
                    of Chinese leadership. It's got a history, of course, of being China's most
                    dynamic and forward looking city. It also produced some of the Gang of Four and
                    has a history of radical currents.</p>
                <p>Q: I wonder if you could talk about how, again we are talking about the '85-'89
                    period when you were Ambassador. You and the Embassy were looking at how all
                    these people fit together. In other words a little bit like criminology. How
                    were decisions reached? How effective was the government at that time?</p>
                <pb facs="0509" n="Page0509"/>
                <p>LORD: Well, on the whole we thought the government was pretty effective in the
                    sense they were moving ahead on economic reform. Most of the time you had the
                    feeling that the envelope was also being pushed somewhat on political and
                    cultural issues, but there was certainly tremendous control still. There was
                    more a sense of the ability to publish more and somewhat freer cultural activity
                    particularly outside of Beijing. Some lively journals like the World Economic
                    Herald in Shanghai which was subsequently shut down. Some of the things Bette
                    was able to do in our cultural exchanges. People pushing the envelope like Liu
                    Binyan, the reformist reporter, in covering corruption. You even had in some of
                    the universities including Beijing University some beginning to speak up for
                    political reform. On the whole we felt that things were moving in a generally
                    positive direction but there were swings back and forth - e.g. the sacking of Hu
                    Yaobang by Deng in 1987. We were still very concerned, particularly about Tibet
                    and the continuing holding of dissidents and repression. With respect to the
                    leadership, of course, we were rooting for those like Hu Yaobang and Zhao
                    Ziyang, who thought it was in China's own self interest as well as to improve
                    our relationship to be more moderate on the political front than, say, Li Peng.
                    We knew that Deng was rather ambivalent and would go back and forth, but on the
                    whole, conservative. As we were there, there were attacks on spiritual
                    pollution, on bourgeois liberalization even as the envelope was being
                    pushed.</p>
                <p>On the whole we thought the government operated quite effectively. Deng, I have
                    already given my impressions of. He obviously was very able, although we were
                    unhappy with some of his political and cultural instincts. We could see even
                    then that he was trying to groom people to come after him which in a communist
                    society is a useful innovation. He was clearly number one even as we left, but
                    even then, by the late '80s, he was beginning to delegate responsibility in
                    meeting with foreigners and day to day decisions of operating the government,
                    all of which we thought were useful. Now clearly we saw trouble signs twice
                    while we were there and just after, where his successors, Hu and Zhao, were
                    dumped by him even as Mao dumped his heirs or successors. Deng was falling into
                    a pattern of dumping his. He got rid of two, both of whom were more liberal in a
                    political sense than he was. There was room for some concern as well when these
                    campaigns that would take place like the Four Cardinal Principals, stressing
                    socialist ideals as well as anti-spiritual pollution and anti-bourgeois
                    liberalization. On the economic front we felt they were making progress, and we
                    thought the leadership was generally quite effective. They were beginning to
                    promote people now based on merit and economic performance rather than
                    revolutionary credentials or military exploits, probably because they had gotten
                    to the point where most of the Long Marchers had passed from the scene or were
                    too old anyway.</p>
                <pb facs="0510" n="Page0510"/>
                <p>Also I was impressed with some of the younger leaders coming along. I made a big
                    effort to travel throughout China, usually with my wife. It was fun and
                    interesting and she could give insights that I couldn't do by myself, and she
                    was a great ambassador. I traveled widely, partly to show the flag, sometimes to
                    advance our economic interests, partly because it was fun, partly to report back
                    to Washington about what was happening around the country, and partly to meet
                    upcoming leaders. I could see that the mayors and the governors were going to be
                    the future leaders of China. Whether it was the mayor of Tianjin (Li Ruihan) or
                    vice governors elsewhere. I remember Sichuan in particular and Guangzhou and Zhu
                    Rongji in Shanghai. I was impressed with the pragmatism, the desire for good
                    relations with us, certainly the economic reforms, that I found in these people.
                    You couldn't tell so much on the political side. On the whole I felt there was a
                    pretty competent group. That was true of the Foreign Ministry, e.g. Qian Qichen
                    (the Foreign Minister) and Zhu Qizhen (the Vice Foreign Minister). Now in
                    decision making, it was clear that Deng was calling the shots on the important
                    issues, U.S.-Chinese relations, U.S.-China-Russia relations, relations with
                    Japan, basic economic reform decisions, Taiwan. These were determined by Deng
                    pretty much on his own. Day to day operations, details, and secondary issues
                    including running the economy on a detailed basis, he would delegate.</p>
                <p>(Bernkopf Tucker): Did you have any sense, from the outside it may be impossible
                    to say, was some of this independent decision making on Deng's part a result of
                    negotiation with Li Peng or others who might have been more hard-line or
                    liberal, or was he really just making up his own mind?</p>
                <pb facs="0511" n="Page0511"/>
                <p>LORD: The honest answer is you can't be sure, because to get back to one of your
                    earlier questions, it was still a fairly opaque society and system even then,
                    though much less than it had been in the '70s. We had much more contacts, more
                    travel, and more reporting. Despite all that, an area that we were not strong in
                    despite all our best efforts was decisionmaking. Certainly our impression was
                    that Deng had an absolute veto. There was no important policy that could be
                    promoted if he opposed it. That's a given. The basic lines, clearly, were
                    supported by his subordinates. It wasn't as if he were enforcing it. Most people
                    wanted to have better relations with the U.S. These people were convinced,
                    although some were more cautious like Li Peng and others, of the need for
                    opening and reform on the economic front. There would be debates on the
                    political side on issues like political reform and Tibet. I think Deng was
                    clearly first among equals, much more in charge than Jiang Zemin today, not
                    having to check so much as Jiang would have to check, although he has solidified
                    his position. Deng, however, was much less a one man show than Mao Zedong. He
                    was somewhere in between, but clearly a dominant figure at that point. He knew
                    enough to know that he wanted to keep both conservatives and moderates happy. He
                    would basically vote by conviction, not just power balance. But he would not
                    veer too much in either direction and was particularly back and forth on
                    political liberalization. Just when we were there, there were two or three
                    periods when politics was getting looser and then it got tighter again. That is
                    clearly where the internal debates were taking place, most vividly demonstrated
                    when Deng had to sack Hu Yaobang to appease the conservatives. So, he didn't
                    want that to get too out of kilter with others, but he clearly was in charge on
                    all the key issues. At heart, throughout his career - and shown again during the
                    June 1989 Tiananmen massacre for which he was responsible - he was very
                    conservative politically.</p>
                <p>Q: While you were making these trips out in the country and all and also in
                    Beijing with our officers also out and about, what was your impression of
                    revolutionary Marxist fervor? The cultural revolution wasn't that far away. It
                    had gone completely sour, but the point being that you had almost a billion
                    people running around as revolutionary as you can get.</p>
                <pb facs="0512" n="Page0512"/>
                <p>LORD: Well, first, on my previous 11 trips to China before I was Ambassador plus
                    my time in that post, by the time I left, I had been to 24 or 25 provinces out
                    of the 30 or 31 depending on how you count Taiwan or Hainan. I was missing Anhui
                    and Ningxia and Guizhou and Hainan for example. I really got around quite a bit
                    for all the reasons I mentioned. Second to answer your question, there was none
                    of the Marxist fervor. Still a lot of people didn't want to talk about, and
                    there was a lot of bitterness about, the Cultural Revolution. Also people
                    whether officials or non-officials were cautious in their conversations. The
                    same is true today. People can speak somewhat more freely when they are alone
                    with you. They can't get up and make speeches that are unsettling to the Party,
                    and they can't organize opposition or distinct parties. In the late '80s, some
                    students and intellectuals might loosen up a little on political issues. Nobody
                    was trying to spout Marxism or revolutionary fervor, to answer your question.
                    They would talk with some bitterness about past excesses, but nobody was going
                    to be criticizing the government or promoting political freedom. The clear
                    exception, with Bette's help, was the circles we had a lot of contact with,
                    students and others in the cultural, academic, and artistic communities, where
                    there was a call for greater political and cultural reform. Even there they
                    would be somewhat cautious. We had a lot of these people to our house. And
                    embassy officials would talk to reformers. Bette went often to people's houses
                    including Liu Binyang and Fang Lizhi. She worked hard on the official front as
                    well. But she stayed in touch with these people to be on the cutting edge. This
                    probably excited some concerns by members of the Politburo. But overall Marxist
                    ideology was pretty dead. Even then people were focusing pretty much on
                    economics and what worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the kids in school or in college. Did they have
                        ttake compulsory Marxism, the works of Mao Zedong and that sort of
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I think we are talking about a trend here. They were pretty much getting
                    away from that; they were getting more pragmatic. But surely there were still
                    ideological parts in their curricula.(Bernkopf Tucker): I remember in the summer
                    of 1987 at one of these informal lunches that you talked about earlier that you
                    would have with them and the staff, that I was there and...</p>
                <p>LORD: You served six months as an intern.</p>
                <p>(Bernkopf Tucker): Yes, and we talked about what was happening in China
                    ideologically and the sense that communism was no longer a very useful tool to
                    rally support for the government, but in those days nationalism still had not
                    risen. If you were analyzing what was happening in China and trying to explain
                    to the State Department and the White House where the Chinese people were, where
                    were you putting your emphasis? What were you telling the United States about
                    the Chinese people ideologically?</p>
                <pb facs="0513" n="Page0513"/>
                <p>LORD: Well, we were somewhat humble and not generalizing, clearly. Obviously we
                    felt that people would be more concerned about these political issues if they
                    were urban dwellers than in the countryside. There was no longer any faith, as
                    you say, in Marxism ideology as an approach and a lot of cynicism given that the
                    wind had shifted so many times in China about what is ideologically correct,
                    leaders going up and down, all of that behind them. Nationalism, although
                    anti-Japanese feeling was clear even then, on the whole didn't rise as naturally
                    as it has today when they have grown so much stronger in power. The authorities
                    increasingly substitute that for the loss of ideology. We reported that the
                    people, certainly in the artistic, intellectual and academic communities, had a
                    real desire for more political reform and a feeling they needed that for
                    economic development as well as to meet the aspirations of the people. So in
                    those circles, we would report considerable ferment and a pushing of the
                    envelope, but without exaggerating their power yet. Frankly, we did not predict
                    Tiananmen Square. I don't think anybody did in terms of the massive
                    demonstrations that did take place not only in Beijing but in over 200 cities.
                    Now those weren't only for democracy, they were against corruption, they were
                    against inflation and for education needs and so on. Basically even then I think
                    we felt the people's basic preoccupation was having a better economic existence,
                    a better life and getting away form the horrors in the past. At least they were
                    close enough to the Cultural Revolution to reach some happiness, some
                    contentment that they at least weren't suffering as badly as they did in the
                    Cultural Revolution. It was early enough in the economic lifting in their lives
                    that they were perhaps not quite as concerned about political issues with the
                    exception of the circles I mentioned. I think we were basically saying there
                    were tensions rising on the political front and some of the elements that were
                    most important and most influential were pushing the envelope. But the broad
                    contacts, encouraged by Bette, made this clear. We didn't realize it was quite
                    as fermenting as Tiananmen Square proved.</p>
                <p>Q: Again, looking at China with a cold eye and trying to look at the future
                    particularly in light of what happened within a few years to the Soviet empire
                    where the nationalities thing split it up, were you looking at nationalities
                    within China? I mean sort of 20 years 50 years down the thing will China hold
                    together or not?</p>
                <pb facs="0514" n="Page0514"/>
                <p>LORD: Well, my basic view I'm sure then, I know it is now, was on the whole I
                    felt China would hold together. That was our basic view in the embassy. Tibet
                    was the most serious issue, and that flared up a couple of times while we were
                    there, with some riots and killings. I was the first Ambassador to visit Tibet,
                    very concerned about it. It was a hot issue through much of my stay there.
                    Xinjiang didn't seem to have much unrest then. It was hard to get to know, and
                    we tried to get reporters out there. In the southern areas where there were
                    minorities or Inner Mongolia, there also didn't seem to be much unrest. In the
                    long historical sweep, we knew about Chinese history and warlords against the
                    emperor, going back and forth between tight central control and splitting up the
                    country. We knew there were those dangers. We also knew already and we reported
                    on it, the tensions between the provinces and Beijing about taxes, about foreign
                    exchange, about autonomy, about how much did they need permission from Beijing
                    to approve joint ventures, what levels, so there was already tension on the
                    economic front between central control and the provinces. We felt, however, this
                    was in a safe framework of unity within the country. There was no real evidence
                    or prospect that China was going to split apart.</p>
                <p>For a variety of reasons I believed - before we knew about the Soviet Union
                    breaking up - and I believe now in retrospect that China has advantages in
                    holding together that the Soviets and Russians did not have. First of all, 93%
                    of the Chinese are Han, whereas in the Soviet Union they were 50% Russian and
                    50% non-Russian. Secondly in the Soviet Union, certainly there was an empire;
                    the Baltic States for example, parts of Central Asia, and some other places were
                    clearly only recently or loosely part of the Soviet Union. Whereas, in China -
                    again, Tibet is a more complicated example - on the whole the present territory
                    of China most people would argue has been Chinese for a considerable period of
                    time. So it is not so much an empire like the Soviet Union was in that sense.
                    Thirdly the Chinese have always had a tremendous advantage in overseas
                    investment, including Chinese, in helping their economy, and the Russians never
                    had that. Fourthly, the Chinese are more self-confident based on 5,000 years of
                    being number one, more a feeling they will be number one again than the
                    Russians, who are less secure. Finally, there is a good deal of Chinese
                    nationalism.</p>
                <p>So for all these reasons at the time I felt, and I still feel, that chances are
                    China will be able to hold together. Furthermore, those who are taking power at
                    the center are generally coming from the provinces or cities and therefore they
                    have some of the perspectives of the outlying areas they could bring to Beijing
                    and some empathy and sensitivity on how to handle this. Having said that, even
                    as we were there, there were considerable tensions between Beijing and the
                    provinces, economic autonomy and who gets the taxes and who gets the foreign
                    exchange and who accrues investment. A good example was Shanghai where in those
                    days it had to pay very heavy taxes to Beijing. Shanghai felt it was the most
                    dynamic part of China; Beijing was reaping the benefits and they weren't. Indeed
                    in recent years with the help of Shanghaiers like Jiang and Zhu there was a
                    great shift and Shanghai has surged ahead as a result.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we talk about Tibet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: First, more on political issues. As I said, on the whole, during the period
                    I was Ambassador, China with fits and starts was moving to become somewhat more
                    open politically and culturally as well as economically. There were obvious
                    tensions and some periods of setbacks both within China and in our own political
                    and cultural relations. For example, we got there in late '85, and up until late
                    '86, on the whole they were moving in a somewhat more liberal direction in terms
                    of artistic and political expression. I do not wish to exaggerate. But, in
                    December, '86, actually while I was back on home leave, there were large scale
                    demonstrations by students in Shanghai and considerable angst within the
                    Politburo that these were not controlled faster and better. Partly as a result
                    of thaHu Yaobang was ousted and indeed a period of some retrenchment on
                    political and cultural freedoms set in. Not only was Hu kicked out as Party
                    Secretary, many of his friends and intellectuals either were repressed or
                    rounded up. There was a campaign against bourgeois liberalization, an emphasis
                    on the four Cardinal Principles. Don't ask me to repeat what they were. Four of
                    your socialist principles. The conservatives generally in this area were on a
                    roll and the reformers were on the defensive. Now having said that, it wasn't a
                    complete rollback.</p>
                <p>Let me give you the reasons Deng dropped Hu. I have already mentioned it, but
                    just to put it here again. He had an unpredictable style that might have annoyed
                    Deng. Deng thought Hu was a little unpredictable and wasn't fulfilling his
                    vision of what a future leader of China should look like and maybe shouldn't be
                    a successor. More fundamentally, Hu's instincts on political reform and issues
                    like Tibet were much more liberal than Deng's were, which were always
                    instinctively cautious. Hu was clearly alienating some of the conservatives on
                    some of these issues and Deng always had to maintain a balance even though he
                    was clearly in charge. Therefore partly out of conviction that Hu was a little
                    bit too liberal, partly because he thought that Hu had helped to cause this
                    unrest in Shanghai, partly to maintain his balance in the Politburo and appease
                    the conservatives, he dropped Hu. As I say, they went after some of his cohorts
                    as well. I said that Ziao Ziyang was also, although not as dramatically, pushing
                    the envelope on political reforms like Hu. Clearly he was also interested in
                    greater political reform, but he was not only maintained as Premier for a while
                    but also made Party Secretary. On the one hand, Deng removed those the
                    conservatives disliked the most. But he didn't do a clean sweep and get rid of
                    Zhao as well or put Li Peng more fully in charge. Zhao wore both hats for a
                    while - he was acting Party Secretary until he became confirmed and then when he
                    became that, at that point Li Peng, who was more conservative, took over as
                    Premier.</p>
                <pb facs="0516" n="Page0516"/>
                <p>Other incidents occurred at this time. As I said earlier, another American
                    newsman from the Associated Press was kicked out. Some overseas Chinese student
                    had come home for the holidays and was arrested. There was a Chinese journalist
                    in Sichuan sentenced to seven years for counter revolutionary activity and so
                    on. I remember sending in, in early February, a think piece to the Secretary on
                    this whole issue. It was quite serious, and there was a considerable rollback
                    taking place. I was more alarmist than my colleagues. They tried to water my
                    cable down. I didn't let that happen. Other sackings at this time included Liu
                    Binyan who was this very outspoken journalist who attacked corruption and has
                    since become a major dissident living here in the United States. Some other
                    Shanghai writers, some officials at the universities and the Chinese Academy of
                    the Social Sciences, and the rather moderate propaganda head were all sacked.
                    This clearly was a period of retrenchment. I remember feeling at the time that
                    this was tarnishing Deng's reputation. He was once again showing that it is
                    tough having an orderly succession when he was dumping his successor, killing
                    all political reform, at least temporarily, maybe even having an impact on
                    economic reform, hurting China's international reputation, creating considerable
                    fear and anger among the intellectuals. It so happened it was about the 30th.
                    anniversary of the anti-rightist campaign. All this at a time when Gorbachev was
                    beginning to gain momentum and an international reputation, for reform including
                    on the political and cultural side in Russia. Of course, this was the classic
                    Chinese dilemma. The leaders wanted to have economic reform without political
                    reform. They were ambivalent about foreign influence, needing outside help but
                    worrying about spiritual pollution. How do they get western technology without
                    western influence?</p>
                <p>Q: Did you get hit with you say spiritual corruption, American movies, American
                    films. I mean the things the French and other people rage about. Did this come
                    up to you at all as far as our youth culture and the whole thing?</p>
                <pb facs="0517" n="Page0517"/>
                <p>LORD: Never conceptually, but there were incidents - I mentioned this National
                    Portrait exhibit. Somewhat later, more related to Bette personally, near the end
                    of our tour, Bette's book finally got a good translation, Spring Moon, but when
                    the Chinese edition came out on the news stands, I guess this was late 1988, you
                    couldn't get it anywhere in the bookstores. She went to a book signing, but the
                    only people who were there were the owners of the store, no readers. As soon as
                    she left, the books were put away. That might have been her personally - her
                    contacts with reformers - because there is nothing really revolutionary about
                    Spring Moon. Certainly when you get into spiritual pollution campaigns, that has
                    the overtones of American cultural influence and American political influence.
                    This would ebb and flow during this period I'm talking about. Early 1987 was
                    clearly an ebbing of any political and cultural freedom. We got a lot of
                    feedback from our artistic, intellectual, and academic friends who were
                    concerned. We had people in the Embassy keeping contact. I don't mean it was
                    just Bette by any means, of course not. We had a lot of good people in the
                    Embassy doing this as well. As I say some who were rounded up and released were
                    intimidated. The foreign journalists reflected this as well. I told you the AP
                    guy had been kicked out. The Burns episode before that. Forty-three of them
                    signed a petition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Twenty of them came over
                    to my residence, and they felt the U.S. Government hadn't been strong enough
                    generally, I held a backgrounder with the press every month. I made a practice
                    of keeping in touch with journalists generally when we got back to the U.S.
                    meeting with editorial boards, etc. I thought that was useful in terms of our
                    own interests and getting the word out on what we were trying to do there. This
                    was generally a period of some malaise. Right after that, Secretary Shultz came
                    in March and moved the U.S. relationship forward. We can get back to that at
                    some other point.</p>
                <p>The Tibet issue flared up a couple of times while we were in China. In the fall
                    of 1987, I have already mentioned how in that year, particularly in the spring,
                    there was a clampdown particularly on political and cultural expression. Whether
                    or not related, things began to heat up in Tibet. The Dalai Lama went to the
                    U.S. in the middle of September, 1987. On September 27, and the next few days
                    there were considerable riots and demonstrations in Tibet. I gather from the few
                    notes I have, there were about 20 deaths and hundreds injured. The Congress
                    passed a resolution 98-0. Tom Brokaw had just been there for NBC and did a piece
                    on China, including on my wife. It was basically positive, but he went to Tibet
                    and said some nice things about the Dalai Lama. The Chinese weren't too happy
                    about that. As I said the Congress sent letters to Zhao, several Congressmen or
                    Senators did, and they passed a resolution 98-0. The media generally was saying
                    we were a little bit too soft on this. We tried to monitor the situation and
                    made representations about torture and repression and putting down the
                    demonstrations in Tibet. We had a political officer that happened to have been
                    there from Chengdu and we kept him there. We tried to get our political
                    counselor in there. It was very difficult. They were making it hard for us to
                    have access, but we smuggled out reports. Again journalists during this period
                    generally had problems. You had to give Beijing 10 day notice to travel
                    anywhere. I think it is fair to say this general period was difficult, with the
                    Tibet problems and human rights more generally, our media and Congress getting
                    more upset, and I believe the Iranian missiles, Silkworms, issue at this point.
                    So when you put all this together, it was a difficult period.</p>
                <pb facs="0518" n="Page0518"/>
                <p>(Bernkopf Tucker): On the Tibet stuff, you have the Dalai Lama in the U.S. and
                    then you get demonstrations and riots in Tibet. Some specialists on Tibetan
                    affairs, Americans, have suggested that one of the things that was happening was
                    the Tibetans becoming more sophisticated on how to play to American public
                    opinion. Was this a concern in the Embassy that there was an effort to
                    circumvent the diplomatic corps and get to Congress directly.</p>
                <p>LORD: No, I don't think we had that feeling. I think you are right. I think there
                    was some synergy between the Dalai Lama's visit in the United States and the
                    demonstrations taking place a few days later. Our reaction was not one of how
                    dare the Tibetans express their views. We were really upset about the Chinese
                    reaction. Now obviously, without suffering from clientitis, we didn't want the
                    Tibet issue any more than any other one issue to wreck our whole relationship. I
                    pushed the Chinese on it, but we would also try to keep the overall relationship
                    going.</p>
                <p>As I said, I went to Tibet, Bette and I went, the first American Ambassador to
                    ever go there, and it may be the first foreign Ambassador of any country who
                    went there on his own, not in connection with some high level visitor. We went
                    from August 4, to August 10, 1988. By now, as I said, I had visited about 24
                    provinces out of 30. Obviously Tibet continued to be an issue and concern, and I
                    thought one way to get at it was to show the flag by going to Tibet, both to
                    convey our concerns to the officials running Tibet as well as back in Beijing.
                    Show the American flag for whatever that might do for the morale of Tibetans and
                    to show the Congressional and domestic audiences that we cared. The Ambassador
                    went personally out there. This stirred a couple of Congressional visits. Among
                    the issues I pushed for was access for our consular officers to visit there. It
                    was covered by Chengdu, we don't have a consulate itself in Tibet. And I pushed
                    for more media and journalists to get in there and outside groups in general,
                    Congress and the press, even human rights groups. I had the most comprehensive
                    talks up to then on Tibet that any American official ever had with the Chinese.
                    I can't say I got very far. I pressed the human rights situation there
                    generally, the suppression of Tibetan culture and people. They gave their
                    familiar defense of how Tibet had been a feudal enclave there before and very
                    badly in need, enduring slavery under the Dalai Lama, how much better off the
                    Tibetans were now. On access I did make some progress. I did get more consular
                    visits and some journalists in there. On prisoners all I got were some numbers,
                    official numbers, and general assurances on treatment, but I could see no
                    breakthroughs there. I wasn't able to visit a jail; they made some vague
                    commitments maybe in the future. We did take a trip across the country to
                    Xigatse. It was spectacular. We continued to treat this issue throughout our
                    stay there.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have the feeling, it's almost I don't want to sound too cynical, but
                    that served as a good rallying flag for particular conservatives who just
                    detested our China policy and this gave them a cause, or did Tibet run deeply in
                    your opinion in the American public?</p>
                <pb facs="0519" n="Page0519"/>
                <p>LORD: Well, the province of Tibet is so remote it is hard to get coverage of it
                    and know what is going on. There is the inherent problem of really knowing what
                    is going on and conveying that to the American people generally. I do think
                    people in Congress and other human rights groups were absolutely sincere in
                    their concern for Tibet and the extinguishing of Tibetan culture, the treatment
                    of nuns and monks and the roundup of prisoners and the put down of
                    demonstrations. Clearly those who were suspicious of China for human rights
                    generally would also highlight this issue for that reason, but it was born out
                    of a genuine concern for what was a genuine problem. I would say it probably was
                    a higher level profile in human rights than anything else we had then, even
                    prisoners or anything else while we were there. It doesn't mean there weren't
                    lots of prisoners.</p>
                <p>I mentioned how generally while we were in China the political and cultural
                    atmosphere was loosening up somewhat back and forth, and I mentioned how we had
                    a tough period particularly in the early part of 1987 and even the latter part
                    of it. As an Embassy, and personally, we raised human rights issues, not just
                    Tibet, of course, but also all the other human rights issues, the need for
                    political reform. But, it was not as high profile as it has been the last few
                    years. Beyond that we tried to have an impact by having philosophic and
                    relatively candid discussions with Chinese officials on the need for political
                    reform and loosening up, including when they would come to our house for meals
                    and round table discussions with American visitors. In addition, I personally
                    and the Embassy generally, with my wife at the center of much of this, spent a
                    lot of time with intellectuals, artists, academics, reformers etc. We wanted to
                    do this partly to report to Washington what was going on in those areas and
                    partly to push the envelope. We could do that culturally in some ways more than
                    we could politically of course. Partly to establish ties with what we felt would
                    be future Chinese leaders. A lot of these people were very bright - the best and
                    the brightest and the younger, and we felt this was important for U.S. national
                    interests as well as being inherently interesting.</p>
                <p>Q: You know we spent a great deal of time dealing with the Soviet intelligentsia,
                    and they turned out not to be very important I gather in what happened in
                    Russia. They gave the impetus and then sort of faded out. When you think of the
                    Chinese culture as being centered on scholarly work and all, did you feel these
                    people would be an important power source?</p>
                <pb facs="0520" n="Page0520"/>
                <p>LORD: Not only I thought they would be, they turned out to be in Tiananmen
                    Square, in and around it. The jury is still out and the history is still being
                    written about the future of China on this front. Even then many were important.
                    I'm not just talking about dissidents although we were in touch with people like
                    Fang Lizhi and Liu Binyan, my wife in particular. But, also people in think
                    tanks, many of whom reported directly to Zhao or Hu with ideas on reforms, both
                    economic and political. These are the kinds of people we had for discussions at
                    the Embassy and so on. So, people already in positions of power although young,
                    in their '30s and '40s, in terms of ideas and think pieces, and the debates
                    going on in China on the need for more political reform. And the cultural side
                    with enlightened people like the cultural Vice Minister Ying Ruochen, the famous
                    Chinese actor, as well as Bette's dealings with the Chinese cultural community,
                    the promoting of a famous opera singer, now in the United States, working with
                    them on the Caine Mutiny Court Martial, putting on Chinese performances at the
                    Embassy and the residence and so on. We felt these people were already important
                    in the internal debates and would be important to future leaders of China.</p>
                <p>Now, as part of this general effort, I would take stock, usually at the end of
                    the year or the Spring Festival in February, of our goals and my goals, personal
                    ones, for the coming year or six months, in addition to sitting down at the
                    Embassy and doing strategy for the year and pursuing our interests and having
                    game plans and so on. We would do this rigorously.</p>
                <p>For the last couple of years I decided, and Bette agreed, that we would make a
                    more concerted effort to continue what we were doing as I have said with the
                    intellectuals and artists, but to get out more to Chinese universities and think
                    tanks in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities more systematically. Even as we
                    carried on all of our official contacts and everything else, we sought to have
                    more interaction with the younger generation, the think tanks, to show the flag,
                    to get their mood and to try to modestly encourage reform efforts.</p>
                <p>So, over a period of just a few months, we each went individually to the National
                    Defense University. It was very unusual for Bette to do that. In fact, I was the
                    first Ambassador there, I believe, and she certainly was the first spouse of an
                    Ambassador. We went out to Beijing University a couple of times with smaller
                    groups. I'll get back to the key one later. We met with a law class and we went
                    to a graduation party. We also went out there with high level visitors. Bette
                    spoke at the People's University. We both spoke at the Foreign Affairs College.
                    We both spoke at the International Business and Economic University. Some were
                    joint appearances including questions and answers. I visited universities in
                    Xiamen and Chengdu. I had a few others later on that either weather or political
                    complications canceled. I visited many think tanks in Beijing, Shanghai and
                    elsewhere. This was all in the period of a few months, so we made a concerted
                    effort to get out there with these groups.</p>
                <pb facs="0521" n="Page0521"/>
                <p>Now part of that, and this is where the story gets interesting, we were invited
                    to come out to Beijing University, June 1, 1988 is when we actually went, to
                    meet with the students outdoors on the lawn. I don't know if it was known then,
                    but in retrospect, it was known as Democracy Salon. The students, among whose
                    leaders included Wang Dan, the famous dissident that has gotten out of jail with
                    U.S. efforts and was exiled to the United States, invited various people to come
                    and speak to them about China and its future, including political reform and the
                    concerns of young people in informal settings. Not for speeches but to sit on
                    the grass and hold conversations. It turns out we were the fifth in a series.
                    One of our predecessors had been Fang Lizhi. I have a story about him later.
                    Bette and I agreed to go out there. Frankly, at the time, perhaps naively - we
                    would have done it anyway - we didn't realize just how sensitive this was for
                    the leadership, for whom we now know in retrospect this whole operation was very
                    sensitive, the students having people like Fang and now the ambassador and his
                    wife. We made no attempt to hide that we were going out. We couldn't anyway
                    because we were bugged all the time and people were following us anyway. I even
                    told - not for purposes of clearance, just courteously or casually or by chance
                    - one of the Foreign Ministry types that by the way I'm going out to Beijing
                    University. Certainly our driver knew it ahead of time and a lot of the local
                    people. There was no question they knew we were going out there, and of course,
                    no one ever complained, at least before the event.</p>
                <p>So we went out there. It was the biggest audience they had ever had. It started
                    at between 300-500 and kept growing while we were there. We arrived at 6:45 and
                    we went on until it got dark at 9:30. A very agitated, excited, enthusiastic
                    crowd. It was no speech, just questions. Many of the questions were personal.
                    What is it like to have an inter-racial marriage in America.? How did you two
                    meet? How does your marriage work? Things that were almost forward. We didn't
                    mind that at all. We were happy to talk about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0522" n="Page0522"/>
                <p>Some questions on foreign policy and U.S.-Chinese relations, but a considerable
                    amount on the domestic situation. I was very struck, even though we had been
                    tracking this and thought we knew what was going on, at the degree of
                    unhappiness, impatience, frustration of the students. Tough questions about the
                    need for political reform, even that the leadership wasn't doing a good job. I
                    was really struck by the openness and the fervor of this group. I, of course,
                    knew there would be security people in the crowd hearing every word. Partly for
                    that reason, knowing I'd be heard, partly as Ambassador, you shouldn't be overly
                    provocative, partly out of conviction because I thought on the economic and
                    opening front, Deng Xiao-ping was doing positive things, and partly so the
                    students wouldn't get in too much trouble, I was very careful. We were very
                    candid about personal things. At times, I found myself almost defending Deng
                    Xiao-ping against the students saying, “Look, he has done a lot of good things
                    and reform will be coming. It is an inevitable process.” I even had a quote that
                    ended up in a Hong Kong newspaper on the front page with my picture, something
                    to the effect that he was one of the more impressive world figures, something
                    very positive. I just mention all this as a matter of fact but also because of
                    what happened next. It was a very exciting, dynamic event. I frankly didn't
                    understand just how sensitive this was for the leadership. I was struck by how
                    excited this crowd was. There weren't just students; there were older people
                    there as well. I assume some teachers, security types, and officials. There was
                    a lot of cynicism among the Chinese students including on corruption, backdoor
                    influence, inflation, future control of their lives. They wanted their leaders
                    to be more accessible and engage in the kind of exchange that they had with us.
                    Anyway, it was a very exhilarating experience.</p>
                <p>We wrote a couple of careful and quite good telegrams back to Washington. By very
                    unfortunate coincidence, the very next day a student was murdered by hooligans.
                    As far as we know it was totally unrelated to any of this, but demonstrations
                    broke out at Beijing University. This was the day after we had been there. They
                    were basically demonstrations on the need for greater security so students
                    wouldn't be murdered by hooligans. It spread to meetings and to wall posters and
                    a march on Tiananmen Square that was aborted and so on. This was quickly
                    controlled by the security people with warnings to the students, plus it quickly
                    died out because many of them realized the '86-'87 protest hadn't helped. In
                    fact, it resulted in Hu Yaobang's having been kicked out. I think many of the
                    students felt that though they were in favor of reform, and they wanted to go
                    faster, they realized that if they got too out of control, they would give the
                    conservatives ammunition.</p>
                <pb facs="0523" n="Page0523"/>
                <p>Obviously the leaders were very antsy about this, generally, our going out there
                    and meeting with the students at the Democracy Salon and there were
                    demonstrations the next day, although it was because of this hooligan murder.
                    They knew from the '86 demonstrations and just generally that there was
                    increasing concern about corruption and inflation. Not just the students but the
                    workers as well. The leaders would always be concerned about the students and
                    the workers linking up. It is one thing in a communist society to have students
                    and intellectuals unhappy, but if you have in a Marxist society the workers
                    unhappy - and they have got the same dilemma today - then you really have a
                    problem for social stability. Clearly they had been watching what had been
                    happening in Poland and Hungary and Yugoslavia, lots of unrest even then in the
                    USSR. There had been a heavy Reagan emphasis on human rights in the late
                    May/June Moscow summit. For all these reasons, the Chinese leaders were
                    obviously antsy. I was out there, as was Bette, to maintain ties with the
                    younger generation, get a feel for what was on their minds, and generally show
                    the flag. We were not there to cause any trouble, obviously, but we did feel
                    this was an important part of our job, also very interesting.</p>
                <p>On June 8, Liu Huaqiu, who was then Country Director for American affairs (he
                    later was Vice Minister and National Security Advisor), called me in to talk
                    about the upcoming trip by the Secretary. This would have been Shultz's second
                    trip. This was a little bit out of line on protocol. Ordinarily he would be
                    dealing with my DCM. I don't know if this was purposeful or not. On the way out
                    after talking about the trip, he took me aside and suggested in friendly fashion
                    that in the future I notify the authorities in advance so that they could make
                    proper arrangements for meetings like this. He casually shrugged it off. I
                    lightly explained why we went out there without being defensive, described some
                    of the subjects we talked about. I said usually when we go to a University or
                    think tank we have to work through authorities just practically, but in this
                    case there was no problem. We just got in touch with the students and went out
                    there. We didn't need help.</p>
                <p>I was in Tianjin on June 9. A new Vice Mayor, new that week, and I guess the
                    Foreign Affairs Director made a friendly warning about a visit to Nankai
                    University that afternoon. Some people were worried about our appearance, but
                    they knew I was an experienced diplomat who would do nothing to disturb
                    stability. We went to the University. I think it was both of us, Bette and me.
                    We had a long session before our speech with the officials that sort of cut off
                    our time with the students. We started later than scheduled, and then there were
                    long and friendly introductions. They made me use translator which cut down the
                    time allotted, even though the audience all spoke English. The questions were
                    written and screened obviously rather than from the floor. All of this was
                    contrary to the way we had operated before where we had informal talks and
                    simultaneous translation, lots of time for questions and answers. The session
                    actually went very well, especially the questions and answers, and the officials
                    did allow it to run over the allotted time by 20 minutes. A big enthusiastic
                    crowd. But we were somewhat rushed.</p>
                <pb facs="0524" n="Page0524"/>
                <p>I got back to the residence, and then I was about to go to Shanghai for a trip
                    and again I could see a pattern, and we knew this was related to what had
                    happened. We learned the students we were supposed to meet with in Shanghai at
                    Jiatong University, my father-in-law's alma mater actually, were suddenly too
                    busy on their exams to see us. We were also supposed to go to Fudan University,
                    and that didn't work out either, in this case perhaps innocently because the
                    Polish Premier was there on Friday and they couldn't get a big student audience
                    on Saturday. I asked for two substitute appointments to take place, one with the
                    World Economic Herald, this progressive newspaper, and one with the Shanghai
                    Academy of Social Sciences. Both of them were too busy to meet me. I met with a
                    Herald reporter at the hotel and made my unhappiness known. Then I met with the
                    Shanghai Mayor, Zhu Rongji, and after some friendly talk about American
                    investment and so on, I said I wanted to meet others and promote cultural and
                    academic links. I was disappointed I couldn't meet people. He said I should come
                    back and would then clearly see people. I don't know how much he knew at the
                    time. The investment climate had greatly improved as I said. We went to a
                    performance of an O'Neill play that evening to open a big festival in Shanghai.
                    Before the show we had a half an hour with the Vice Mayor and others. We
                    purposely, literally sat for half an hour silently, and Bette and I absolutely
                    refused to say a single word to the Vice Mayor for the whole time. We were
                    showing that we knew what had happened to us in Shanghai and we didn't like it.
                    I, of course, went up on stage after the show and congratulated the performers;
                    it wasn't their fault.</p>
                <p>Then during the following week we got reports of displeasure over the Beijing
                    University appearance. There were reports of displeasure about it at a Politburo
                    meeting. I don't recall how we got these reports. They were secondhand, but I
                    think, reliable, probably Embassy contacts.</p>
                <p>The banquet was at Beihai Park in Beijing. As I was walking in, the Ambassador to
                    Washington - Han Xu his name was, he was called back to China for consultation -
                    asked me to step outside. I had known him ever since the first trips to China.
                    By now so many things had happened this past week, I figured what the subject
                    was going to be about. He said something of the following. The Chairman, Deng
                    Xiaoping, respected me greatly and in a friendly and private way he suggested
                    that I be more prudent with students.</p>
                <pb facs="0525" n="Page0525"/>
                <p>I went back very toughly. Han Xu was an old friend I had known since the
                    Kissinger days. I knew he was going to be the messenger, so I wanted to make
                    sure. I was clear and firm. I said I was astonished and upset. I wasn't rude,
                    but I made clear I was mad. I pointed to the South China Morning Post from Hong
                    Kong which said that I had said that Deng Xiaoping was one of the most
                    impressive leaders in the world. I had, out of sincerity, certainly said nothing
                    negative and behaved myself with the students. Someone was misinforming the
                    Chairman; I was deeply saddened about this. In any event I don't understand and
                    I can't accept this. I was very surprised and deeply displeased. How would he
                    feel if we told him he had to coordinate every meeting at an American university
                    in the United States and we restricted his movements. I explained my reasons for
                    going out there. How would he feel if Ronald Reagan sent a message through me to
                    him saying you can't go to Yale University without checking with us and so on.
                    He didn't respond. We sat next to each other at the banquet. I repeated my
                    messages during a very stiff time. I wasn't friendly, but I wasn't discourteous.
                    He was an old friend.</p>
                <p>Then I asked him to step outside afterwards and said please convey my message to
                    the Chairman. As I was driving away in the car, he ran up and tapped on the
                    window to catch up with me to be sure he got the message right. I think he was a
                    little taken aback, so he wanted to make sure I would go over it again. He got
                    an envelope and wrote it down. I basically said I have deep respect for the
                    Chairman. I told the Beijing students he was one of the most impressive leaders
                    I have met. I was very sad that someone was misinforming him about the
                    encounter. We should straighten this out. I just don't understand because there
                    is no better friend of U.S.-China relations. I have worked on it for 17 years. I
                    was surprised and sad. Then I added the other themes, I have every right to do
                    this, and what is going on and so on. Han Xu was clearly upset. I reported all
                    of this in close held cables. I had my Deputy go in and basically repeat the
                    same themes to Liu Huaqui the next day. Washington's comment a couple of days
                    later was a bit ambivalent. It is great you guys are getting out and talking to
                    all the students, thanks and we applaud this. But I thought there was a little
                    bit of softness there because Washington also asked, “Do we really need to have
                    such a high profile at this point?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's typical, you know, don't rock the boat.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0526" n="Page0526"/>
                <p>LORD: Sometimes it is the other way around, with the Ambassadors saying don't
                    rock the boat, and it is Washington wanting you to be tougher. So this is
                    backwards you know. However, I think my message back to the Chinese did have
                    some impact because without going into great detail, they began to be quite
                    friendly again. At the banquet the next night, the Vice Premier was extremely
                    friendly, said he wanted to play tennis with me. This also came from the mayor
                    of Tianjin who wanted to play tennis. The Vice Minister of Public Security was
                    friendly. Several high ranking people came to a Nabisco joint venture opening
                    when they had absolutely no reason to do so. Liu Huaqui told the DCM to tell me
                    not to worry at a dinner a few days later. All the contacts were very friendly.
                    It just shows you their paranoia and their collectivity. It shows you how they
                    all act together canceling things and postponing things on the one hand, and
                    then you get tough and they back off and they get all friendly again. I really
                    laid into them, and of course, all of this has much greater resonance now when
                    we think of Democracy Salon, Tiananmen Square, Wang Dan and everything else.</p>
                <p>Q: No, this is very interesting. Now, other times you were saying what was said
                    at the salon of democracy, but how about when you are talking at think tanks or
                    students prior to this? Were you getting good solid questions?</p>
                <p>LORD: That is a good question. It would vary. I mean there were times when you'd
                    go to think tanks, and you could usually have very good discussions on
                    U.S.-Chinese relations, on international issues, you know the Middle East or
                    Russia. Taiwan you'd get the party line. You wouldn't raise that yourself unless
                    they did, and they usually didn't. When it came to the Chinese domestic scene,
                    not much problem, even some debate on economic reforms. But, I never felt there
                    was much loosening up either in these joint sessions or even one on one on
                    political issues. Despite the fact the envelope was being pushed open, people
                    were still very cautious, including my best friends in the government as well as
                    think tankers certainly about talking in front of others with any degree of
                    candor about political issues and even alone. Occasionally we'd have working
                    dinners at our house with a mixture of officials, semi-dissidents, reformers. We
                    were always trying to keep this debate going and hear about it and participate.
                    People would venture modestly into more controversial issues. The only frank
                    discussions would take place when some of our Embassy contacts who could speak
                    Chinese were alone with people at times, and certainly Bette and her
                    conversations in her circles.</p>
                <p>The universities always gave very enthusiastic receptions. I think it was
                    genuine, they were pleased to have an Ambassador and his spouse come out and
                    they like America generally. The questions were always clearly either softball
                    easy ones or ones designed to put you a little bit on the defensive. I'm sure
                    they were all screened.</p>

                <p>LORD: No, I don't think so. I don't think in the United States we would do what
                    they did to Clinton in Beijing (in 1998) where they had the questions
                    orchestrated and the students weren't even allowed to stand up when he came in.
                    Even today they control events, let alone back then. I have no illusions that
                    our meetings with the students were anything but carefully scripted (except for
                    Democracy Salon). No student is going to ask a question that would get him in
                    trouble. But often they asked personal questions or interesting questions on
                    other issues. But never much engagement on political issues with the exceptions
                    I talked about, particular circles and particularly courageous individuals like
                    Fang Lizhi and Liu Binyan.</p>
                <p>Q: This is really on the same theme, but I was wondering for somebody reading
                    this a couple of centuries from now, some historian will be ruffling through
                    this. To get a feel for the role of the United States you conceived I mean in
                    the world, Did you feel that what you were doing in a sense in the American
                    Embassy, you were alone or were the French Embassy, the French Ambassador, the
                    British Ambassador, were others out there pushing these same themes, or were we
                    pretty much on our own?</p>
                <p>LORD: Pretty much on our own. That is true even as we speak. Certainly in any
                    official government policies on human rights we were generally on our own. The
                    others gobble up the contracts and hold our coat so to speak, while we take on
                    the tough issues. The Japanese, partly because of the guilt feelings of what
                    they did in Nanjing and elsewhere in World War Two, partly because they worry
                    about making money, the Europeans because of money. There were some exceptions,
                    the Australians, occasionally the Canadians, sometimes the British or the
                    Europeans would weigh in. With respect to Ambassadors, I can't be sure about
                    what every Ambassador or Embassy was doing, but I don't know of any that were
                    getting out to the students or the think tanks like I was. I know there was
                    nobody anywhere close to the kind of contacts that we had thanks to Bette with
                    the reformist, cultural, academic, and artistic communities.</p>
                <p>Q: But as a mission, we in a way, I mean besides due to your wife you had these
                    contacts, but I mean you felt you had as part of the mission of the American
                    Ambassador to push these things.</p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, and I also...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These other ones were not particularly pushy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0528" n="Page0528"/>
                <p>LORD: That is absolutely right. Whether it is specific issues like Tibet or
                    prisoners or whether it is generally getting engaged in debates on political
                    reform. Now I want to be accurate here and not self-serving. I don't want to
                    pretend that we were vigorously leaping up and down and beating the drums and
                    pushing the envelope in aggressive, obnoxious ways. We were somewhat
                    circumscribed. Human rights was less of an issue in the average cabinet level
                    meeting than it would be today or at least it was when I was serving in the
                    Clinton Administration. You cannot have a cabinet level meeting today or even a
                    working level meeting without these issues coming up. That was not the case in
                    the late '80s. Not because we didn't care, but it wasn't quite as high profile.
                    This was still during the Cold War and before the Tiananmen massacre, so don't
                    want to exaggerate our pressures. Having said that, compared to other countries
                    and other embassies, we certainly worked on these issues, and certainly Bette in
                    particular and also I personally worked on these issues.</p>
                <p>We did so for a variety of reasons. First, human aspirations and justice, some of
                    the human rights issues, freedom of expression, that man or woman doesn't live
                    by bread alone. Particularly as you build up a middle class and you have
                    economic advancement, people are going to want this. Improvements on human
                    rights and freedom would greatly build up support in America for an engagement
                    policy and conversely setbacks made it more complicated - in the interest of our
                    bilateral relationship and therefore in China's interest as well. A feeling even
                    then, although it is much clearer now 12-15 years later, that as you open up to
                    the outside world and develop your economy with the help of outside investment
                    and technology, and as you begin - it was not that clear then - to have
                    computers and Internet and fax machines, that you've got to have a freer flow of
                    information. You can't develop a modern economy without greater dissent, greater
                    debate, greater openness, greater ability to express your views, greater
                    pluralism in the political system. As you move toward a marketplace, you have
                    less control, all of these things are important. And a feeling, again I felt
                    then and I do now, that as the President said on his recent trip, that stability
                    requires freedom. China was - and is - undergoing the pain of transition from
                    one kind of economy to another with unemployment and all the other problems,
                    corruption, inflation, etc. The Chinese people must be able to express views
                    peacefully. If they don't have those avenues of peaceful dissent, the other
                    alternative is to take to the streets. All of this opposed to the argument of
                    the Chinese authorities, that is self-serving, that one needs repression for
                    stability, I felt and still feel that you need more openness for stability. You
                    can't get at the problem of corruption without a free press, and you can't get,
                    attract and maintain investment without the rule of law. You can't debate about
                    top economic decisions without the free flow of expression and information and a
                    free press. You can't have stability unless people can let off steam through
                    peaceful means. By virtue of the American relationship and support for our ties
                    with China, by virtue of justice, by virtue of China's self-interest, I felt
                    that this was part of our mission.</p>
                <pb facs="0529" n="Page0529"/>
                <p>I also want to make it clear that I felt very strongly that we needed to move
                    ahead with China despite its clear imperfections and the problems of human
                    rights. Because of our strategic, economic, and political interests, we spent an
                    awful lot of time promoting these other elements of our relationship, indeed the
                    bulk of our time. Bette, for example as well as I, spent the overwhelming part
                    of her time with officials, in addition to pushing the envelope with some of
                    these other groups.XX. AMBASSADOR TO CHINA - 1989 EVENTS AND GENERAL COMMENTS
                    (1989)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: I don't know about where you are
                        othings. Do you want to talk about the Bush visit and Fang Lizhi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, because that is an interesting story, too. This will be about
                    President Bush's trip to China in early 1989 in the home stretch as my tenure as
                    Ambassador. Let me say that I greatly looked forward to this trip as sort of a
                    capstone of my tenure there. I had made clear before the November 1988 election
                    that no matter who was elected, as much as I loved this job and it was the best
                    job I had ever had for enjoyment, that I was ready after three and a half years
                    to move on. Washington ought to think of a successor.</p>
                <p>Bush I had known for a long time. I had played tennis with him on occasions. I
                    had seen him almost every time I went back to Washington, talked to him about
                    China when he was Vice President. I briefed him on behalf of Nixon and Kissinger
                    when he went out to head up the Liaison Office early in his career. I had what I
                    thought was a very good relationship. He was a newly elected President. He was
                    going to Japan to see the Emperor, but he was going to come to China on an
                    official visit, but not on a full state visit.</p>
                <pb facs="0530" n="Page0530"/>
                <p>As an old friend of China, one who had worked on the relationship, he was looking
                    forward as was Mrs. Bush to return home and see all their old friends. As we got
                    ready for the visit, it couldn't have been a better lead up. To make a long
                    story short, we went full speed, and we were good at this frankly, my Deputy
                    Tomsen and my whole team working with the advance team to get ready for this
                    trip. The head of the advance team who had been working on trips for more than a
                    decade said it was the best Embassy he had ever worked with. I was the most
                    involved Ambassador he had ever worked with. This is not to be self-serving but
                    to set up something later on. Indeed we just beat our brains out, for a
                    President, a new President. Everything was going terrifically well, logistics,
                    even though it was going to be a 48 hour short trip. The advance team was
                    ecstatic. We sent in the usual think pieces. I personally wrote some personal
                    ones for the President and made sure they got to him. I got word back that he
                    very much enjoyed them before he came out including two portraits of Deng
                    Xiaoping, one with what he had accomplished generally in Chinese history and the
                    challenges he faced and secondly a personal portrait of Deng, his family, his
                    background, his history and how to deal with him. And we had other scene
                    setters. The Chinese had gone out of their way to make this a friendly visit.
                    The Chinese media play was the warmest for any visit I had seen. Again, our
                    relations were fully on track after Shultz's visits and the Secretary of Defense
                    and many others. We were moving along pretty well, although we had continuing
                    problems. He was a new President and an old friend. Everybody wanted to see him
                    so the problem was sorting out who got on his schedule on a brief 48 hour visit.
                    The Chinese agreed to have him go on live television. The first time I believe
                    any foreign leader, certainly the first time any American President, had
                    addressed the Chinese live, well before this Clinton visit (1998). They also
                    worked with us, very unusual for them, to stage a “spontaneous” photo
                    opportunity in Tiananmen Square. He'd get out of his car and mingle with the
                    crowds. Indeed he got a great picture with Tiananmen Square in the background.
                    It was on the cover of Time International. So everything was going swimmingly. I
                    had visions of a perfect capstone to my tenure there, going out with a
                    successful trip by the new President, and we were very excited about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0531" n="Page0531"/>
                <p>As part of the trip, there was to be on Sunday night, he arrived on Saturday, his
                    return banquet for the Chinese in the Great Wall Hotel. We had instructions from
                    the White House to make it a big banquet, include all walks of life, old Chinese
                    friends but all parts of society, reach a broad audience. They asked us for
                    guest lists. Let me just sum up the experience I had, and then I'll tell you
                    what happened. Mao Zedong once said that a revolution is not a dinner party.
                    Well, this turned out to be a dinner party that turned out to be a revolution.
                    In order to draw up a guest list that we had to have approved by Washington, we
                    asked each section of the Embassy to come up with suggestions as to who should
                    be included. We came up with a full list which we sent into Washington a couple
                    of weeks before the visit, soon after they had asked for it. It included all
                    kinds of people, officials, American businesspeople, Chinese, academics, you
                    name it. It also included a few dissidents, depending on how you define
                    dissidents, at least pro-reformers, several of them, one of whom was Fang Lizhi,
                    who had been at Hefei University. He was outspoken on political reform, going
                    around giving speeches that the Chinese authorities were not happy with. He had
                    lost his job there, but was still an official research worker for the Chinese
                    government in Beijing. So, he was still officially that. Although clearly
                    pushing the envelope on political reform, he was not some wild eyed radical
                    trying to overthrow the government, but obviously was someone of some
                    controversy. At the same time, he was a widely respected scientist, a world
                    class astrophysicist. Three different sections of our embassy individually
                    recommended Fang be on the list.</p>
                <p>Our view was the following which we explained in a cable we sent back with the
                    guest lists. We pointed out the several reformers/dissidents with explanations
                    of all of them on the list. We said the Chinese won't like this but frankly we
                    did not expect an explosion in the reaction. We said we thought it was important
                    that the President demonstrate his overall concern with human rights as part of
                    our engagement with the Chinese, out of principle, to lift the morale of
                    reformers, to try to help the China situation and to protect himself with his
                    domestic audience and Congress back home. If we had a separate meeting with
                    dissidents - after all, Reagan had done this in Russia - if we had a separate
                    meeting with dissidents, generally or with Fang in particular, this we felt
                    would be overly provocative to the Chinese. Particularly in such a very short
                    visit with so many friends, so many Vice Premiers and others were disappointed
                    not to see him. To say he couldn't see Vice Premier so and so, but then he sees
                    dissidents, we just felt this was going too far. But we thought it was important
                    that he show some demonstration of concern for human rights for all the reasons
                    I mentioned. Thus we had him visiting a church on Sunday morning, which he did.
                    We had him refer to human rights although much more gingerly than we do now.
                    There were related elements in his remarks on TV. We had Secretary Baker raise
                    the issue of human rights as well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Baker being Secretary of State.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0532" n="Page0532"/>
                <p>LORD: We felt the other way to do it was to include a few dissidents in the
                    banquet which after all was huge. Not have a separate meeting. This was a nice
                    balance. We sent the list in to Washington. Given the usual inertia you usually
                    get on those things, we got no response approving the list. We were running out
                    of time because we had to issue the invitations. Actually in putting together
                    the list, we got suggestions from three different sections, the political
                    section, the science and technology section, and the USIA section, press and
                    culture. Each suggested separately several dissidents including Fang. I would
                    have added him if he wasn't included. Three different sections told us we should
                    do this. I mention this partly because there was a New York Times article a few
                    weeks later which said that Bette Bao Lord, this known radical, had inserted
                    Fang on the guest list which caused trouble at the summit. Or, maybe it was said
                    approvingly by the human rights people. Whatever way it was said, it was totally
                    inaccurate. I had her go over the list too, because I welcomed her judgment. The
                    point is even before we got to the list, three different sections independently
                    had suggested him and other dissidents.</p>
                <p>So, we sent it to the White House and the State Department, the whole list on
                    February 10. As I say, we had a few dissidents, and we specifically foresaw some
                    problems. To be fair we did not see there would be an explosion. We got no
                    reply, so we sent a moderately changed guest list with some additions and some
                    deletions on February 18, but no changes among the reformers. Again I made sure
                    we flagged Fang in particular for Washington. By now we are running out of time;
                    the President is arriving about a week later. We pressed the advance team to
                    help us.</p>
                <p>Q: You were saying you were consulting...</p>
                <p>LORD: We are talking about the Fang Lizhi banquet incident. Finally, the top
                    White House advance man called the White House and got approval on the phone for
                    the whole list. We had to move fast on the invitations. We had one of our
                    Chinese local employees (who report to the Chinese security service all the
                    time) call the Academy of Sciences to extend the invitations orally to those at
                    the academy including Fang. We did a lot of invitations by phone to alert
                    people, and then we were going to follow up with a written invitation. We heard
                    the next day on February 22 some confused report about somebody saying Fang
                    wasn't actually on the list. It turns out later that a protocol person from
                    thForeign Ministry called over to the Academy later and said Fang wasn't invited
                    after we had invited him. We then got the invitations out. In many cases we had
                    to hand carry them to many places; we had such short notice. We had somebody
                    from the Embassy hand carry the invitation to Mrs. Fang for both of them. We did
                    this in many other places because of time constraints.</p>
                <pb facs="0533" n="Page0533"/>
                <p>That evening at an advance team banquet, a protocol guy complains, taking us
                    aside. It wasn't a huge complaint but it was the first warning we got. We said
                    relax, big crowd, diverse. Don't get so upset about this. We're inviting Fang as
                    a world reknowned scientist. We immediately alerted Washington to this. This
                    could be trouble. We want you to know they reacted to the Fang invitation.</p>
                <p>Then for the next 48 hours, getting closer and closer to the President getting
                    there, we didn't hear anything from the Chinese, so we began to feel pretty good
                    and figured this wasn't going to be a problem. We kept wondering if we were
                    going to be called in and they were going to escalate this. We hadn't heard
                    anything, so we began to feel pretty good. Meanwhile, somehow the French press
                    runs with something in Taiwan about how we invited Fang and some idiot in our
                    Embassy on background said, yes, we did this to make a statement. The Chinese
                    would have reacted anyway, I'm sure. Throughout this, however, a tremendous warm
                    reception was building for Bush and very warm friendly media coverage continued
                    to go forward. We kind of figured we were pretty well home free.</p>
                <p>Then at 6:30 on Friday, February 24 (the day before the President's arrival), the
                    Vice Minister, a guy named Zhu Qizhen, said he wanted to see me. I get a little
                    nervous; I wonder what this is about. I think I probably know what it is about
                    although I thought we were home free. So I go out to Daoyutai guest house for a
                    final thank you to the advance team and then to the Foreign Ministry. I don't
                    remember the exact chronology. Zhu said this is a real problem for the Chinese,
                    their leadership. I don't have this exactly right, but it was, I believe, around
                    9:00 Friday night. We had the roughest meeting I have ever had with the Chinese.
                    With Zhu I went through all the arguments about how they shouldn't blow this out
                    of proportion. It is just one person at a banquet. He is being invited as a
                    reknowned scientist, etc. I, of course, when I first heard their complaints,
                    just on my own said to the Chinese, I will report this. I said, I can't speak
                    for Washington but I am sure they won't want change to the guest list. I
                    couldn't imagine, particularly after it had leaked, that we could back off from
                    this. The President would have gotten massive criticism. Because there was so
                    little time, I didn't want the Chinese to have any illusion that we were going
                    to back away. I said, of course I'll report and consult. I immediately sent a
                    message to Korea and Air Force One. It was less than 20 hours before the
                    President's arrival. I kept sending messages in. I mention all of this because
                    it comes up later about whether I kept Washington informed.</p>
                <p>Scowcroft in response to my cable calls me in the middle of the night and tells
                    me to go in for another appointment. We both knew the Chinese were listening in
                    so we made points about not causing controversy for their benefit. I go in at
                    9:30 that Saturday morning to try to turn this around again. Another tough go
                    around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Scowcroft is the National Security Advisor.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0534" n="Page0534"/>
                <p>LORD: Again I send another wire to the plane. Then at 12:30, the President is
                    landing four hours later. The Vice Minister calls me again. This is a message
                    from President Yang Shangkun to President Bush, basically saying if Fang Lizhi
                    comes to the banquet, Yang is not coming and nobody else is coming from the
                    leadership. By now I know I have a disaster on my hands. With each development I
                    sent a cable either by NIACT [Night Action] or Flash, which is almost like a
                    nuclear war, to make sure the President's party on the plane knew exactly what
                    was happening. The last one they didn't get because it was so shortly before
                    they landed in Beijing. The last Yang message, Bush didn't get that until he was
                    at the guest house. He was well aware of the problem,but he had not realized it
                    had escalated to this point.</p>
                <p>I went up on the plane to greet the President which you usually do. He was
                    distinctly unfriendly. You could tell he was mad at me about how this whole
                    thing had come up. I rode in with Baker and I said I still thought there was a
                    chance that either the Chinese would relent or Fang would decide not to cause
                    trouble and not come. Something might happen.</p>
                <p>We proceed with the trip. Perhaps it was like Mrs. Lincoln at the play, but the
                    rest of the trip went extremely well. The whole time Bush was nervous, as we all
                    were, about how this was going to come out. It would be a clear debacle to have
                    a return banquet and no Chinese leaders there. It would not have gone unnoticed
                    by the press. Throughout the Chinese are keeping us hanging. Their official
                    position remains the same. We go through the rest of the trip. Bush has a
                    meeting and a working lunch with Deng that goes very well. He gives Deng some
                    boots and Deng gives him a bicycle. He meets with the Embassy staff, and now, he
                    and Mrs. Bush are not all that friendly to us. They figure we had gotten them
                    into this trouble. In his remarks to the Embassy employees, he barely mentions
                    the Ambassador or his wife which a week earlier would have been unthinkable. He
                    has meetings with all these other people and they all go well. I won't go into
                    all the details. He was given a warm welcoming banquet. All is going very well
                    in substance. There is one meeting which is running late that we are nervous
                    about because he is due to go on live television. He races there and goes on at
                    the last minute, and that goes well. It is a very productive, good trip, but
                    this incident is hanging over us, and obviously keeping everyone on edge.</p>
                <p>Let me segue for a minute to show the edge. My wife, of course, was in charge of
                    Mrs. Bush's itinerary. She had known her well and favorably in the past. For
                    several weeks she had sent messages back to Mrs. Bush, to her chief of staff,
                    with schedules and plans and never got any response. To this day we don't know
                    if it was total ineptness or unfriendliness or what. Literally no guidance on
                    what to do with the First Lady. We would call and send messages, just a black
                    hole. Bette had prepared and recommended some very interesting and imaginative
                    events for the First Lady, none of them in the least controversial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This, of course, is before...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0535" n="Page0535"/>
                <p>LORD: Before they ever took off. This is totally unrelated to the Fang issue. We
                    think it was just plain incompetence in Mrs. Bush's office, but who knows? It
                    was impossible for Bette. Anyway she came up with a spectacular series of
                    events. I don't want to sound self-serving for my wife, but it happens to be
                    true. She got an old place opened up that hadn't been open for years, and
                    arranged a session with top Chinese women of all walks of life, none of whom
                    were radicals. They were artists and academics and working women and wives of
                    leaders. She had special tables and entertainment. It was totally cultural, not
                    political. It was a beautifully thought out event for Mrs. Bush, all of which
                    Bette had to do without guidance because she hadn't gotten any guidance. During
                    the rest of the trip everything went well; the usual things Mrs. Bush wanted to
                    do. The Bushes went to church Sunday morning. We were very moved by the whole
                    affair, the very idea of this church again in China. It went back to when Bush
                    was in the Liaison Office. He sat next to a 90 year old woman who had tears in
                    her eyes and hadn't been in church in decades. All of us were moved by this. I
                    come out and I am with the President.Mrs. Bush gets in another car with my wife
                    and starts screaming at her literally at the top of her lungs about the next
                    social event Bette had planned. Why did you get me into this affair with these
                    Chinese women? I don't want a lot of political controversy. Why can't I go to
                    the Summer Palace? Bette, of course, said she wouldn't do anything to embarrass
                    her. I think you will enjoy this, she said. She was quiet about the fact that
                    she hadn't had any guidance from Mrs. Bush. This incident made clear to me that
                    Mrs. Bush's public appearance is not quite the same as her private personality.
                    She was unbelievably rude to my wife. It turned out the affair was fantastic.
                    Mrs. Bush enjoyed it and she hugged Bette at the end and so on. It was something
                    we didn't forget. By then that particular episode was reflecting the tension of
                    the Fang problem, obviously. I still don't understand why we didn't get any
                    guidance before then.</p>
                <p>Anyway, back to the main drama. Finally at the President's meeting Sunday
                    afternoon with Zhao Ziyang, the banquet being Sunday night, we get a note passed
                    to me from the Chinese that the Chinese leaders have now agreed to come to the
                    banquet. We are throwing our hats in the air and figure everything is fine. They
                    didn't say anything about Fang not coming; they just said they were coming. The
                    Chinese said they don't want any press conference about Fang at the banquet or
                    him at the head table. We said obviously we are not going to do that; we are
                    going to treat him as a regular guest. Then the tension is relieved; it is going
                    to be a great trip. Even though we had been on edge for the last 48 hours, it
                    was going to have a happy ending.</p>
                <pb facs="0536" n="Page0536"/>
                <p>We had this big Texas style barbecue at the Great Wall Hotel. We had all friendly
                    people at Fang's table but made sure his table wasn't in direct line of sight of
                    the leaders. We were trying to be as sensitive as possible. We go through the
                    banquet. I'm feeling great. We are having good discussions and the toasts are
                    great, and everything is terrific. I can't see Fang's table from where I am
                    sitting at the head table. I'm just assuming he is there. I don't see anything.
                    We all assumed that. At one point Bette got a note passed to her during the
                    banquet saying an academic - they got the name wrong but something that rhymes
                    with Perry Link - wants to see you. Bette didn't know what that was about, and
                    said I'll see him later or something. It turns out as the history books now know
                    that it was Perry Link who was with Fang and his wife. They had gone to the
                    hotel and were turned away by the Chinese security and weren't allowed to
                    attend.</p>
                <p>None of this we knew until I got into the car after dinner, feeling euphoric at
                    the end of this trip. My economic counselor lets me know that Fang is at the
                    Embassy. He couldn't go to the banquet; he had been prevented by Chinese
                    authorities. My heart stopped. I knew the press was going to get a hold of this.
                    It turned out to be a disaster beyond my wildest dreams. We get back to the
                    guest house and Fang holds a press conference at a hotel. That's all the press
                    cares about, nothing else about the trip. It is all down the drain.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, I should point out for the history books that Scowcroft had told me
                    beforehand on Saturday that first this was just a fantastic job of getting ready
                    by the Embassy for the President. Secondly he volunteered the Fang problem,
                    which is still up in the air, was certainly not the Embassy's fault. He was mad
                    that it hadn't been brought to his attention or Baker's attention, that lower
                    level people had cleared the guest list. I immediately said, I don't want them
                    to get burned, that it is nobody's fault. None of us could have predicted the
                    Chinese would be so unreasonable.</p>
                <p>Back to the unfolding disaster. I had to take a sleeping pill to get to sleep. It
                    was a low point in my career; I can tell you that. You know you don't want to
                    see a presidential trip go down in flames particularly when you are in the
                    middle of it. The U.S. side is having breakfast the next morning in the guest
                    house, the top of the American team. I am purposefully, obviously not invited to
                    the breakfast with the President, Baker, and Scowcroft. It was highly unusual,
                    the Ambassador not being there, having a skull session on what to do. They
                    decided to have the President say he complained to the Chinese before he got on
                    the plane at the airport, and they would issue a stronger statement once they
                    were airborne, not on Chinese soil.The President does this at the airport and I
                    am sent in to Zhu to complain as well. I spend the next couple of days madly
                    working on the press, sending cables to the party, playing up the positive side
                    of the visit. The Chinese are beginning to relax about it and cooling off about
                    it and playing up the positive themes. I am urging the White House to do the
                    same. It was clear that Bush was so pissed off at what had happened that he
                    wasn't hearing much of this. The whole idea was to put a positive spin on the
                    trip, which had the virtue of being true. It was important for a variety of
                    reasons, and the Chinese were willing to play ball at that point. We were making
                    some progress; this thing was quieting down.</p>
                <pb facs="0537" n="Page0537"/>
                <p>Then there was a backgrounder in the press that was given by Scowcroft. It was
                    clear at the time it was either Scowcroft or Sununu, the Chief of Staff. It
                    appeared in the Washington Post and the New York Times, and was picked up by
                    papers all over the place, Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, American papers. The
                    backgrounder was by a senior White House official effectively saying the Embassy
                    had screwed up the President's visit, it hadn't kept the Washington team
                    informed about the Chinese being upset, and it had invited Fang Lizhi on its
                    own. All of which is totally untrue of course. That is why I wanted in this
                    history to go into details in terms of clearing the list. We hadn't predicted
                    the time bomb, but nobody did. We did point out probable Chinese irritations. I
                    still think it was the right thing to do obviously. We kept Washington fully
                    posted. The White House and State had cleared the list, including Fang, etc.</p>
                <p>My Embassy colleagues were about ready to lob nuclear bombs on Washington. I
                    immediately called the entire senior staff together and said no one is to talk
                    to the press. We are supposed to support the President and show a united front.
                    This is a stupid backgrounder and it is unfair to the Embassy and not in
                    American interests but I don't want any stories coming out of here. Keep your
                    mouth shut. Nothing came out of the Embassy. So there was total discipline by
                    the outraged Embassy staff.</p>
                <p>Over the next two days with the help of Tomsen and my wife, I drafted a secret
                    message to Scowcroft with a copy to Baker. I knew Scowcroft had done this, but I
                    didn't want Baker to think, no matter what the subject, that I was communicating
                    with the National Security Advisor without keeping the Secretary of State
                    informed. Baker was in Vienna; Scowcroft was in Washington. I had it double
                    encrypted and sent by the CIA through the White House Situation Room, hand
                    delivered so no one else would see it except Scowcroft and the same procedure in
                    Vienna with Baker.</p>
                <pb facs="0538" n="Page0538"/>
                <p>I rewrote the message about 10 times. I wanted to keep it professional and cool.
                    I basically said the following. I pointed out the President's trip had gone well
                    and we should otherwise accentuate the positive. I said I'm a professional, I
                    have been around for 30 years. There are times when you need a scapegoat for the
                    national interest or the President, and an Ambassador or someone else should
                    take a fall. I don't have any problem with that principle. I think that's time
                    honored and sometimes useful. But, leaving that aside, first, of course, you
                    will remember the chronology - I did clear the list, I did keep them posted and
                    so on. I did it just clinically. Then leaving that aside, let's just look at it
                    from the U.S. national interest. What has this backgrounder done besides being
                    totally inaccurate? Number one, it revived the whole issue, just when the
                    Chinese and the American sides were letting it die. So, it overtook any positive
                    play. Number two, it looked weak to the Chinese, having the President look
                    defensive and embarrassed about inviting somebody who was not a bomb thrower at
                    a banquet with 900 people. Reagan had gone to Moscow and met separately with
                    dissidents. This backgrounder made it look like we are so sorry we hurt the
                    Chinese feelings. That is not the way I said it in my message, but it is the
                    thrust of my message. We looked wimpish and weak to the Chinese which is not a
                    good idea at any time with any country particularly not the Chinese, and
                    particularly not for a new President of the United States starting out a new
                    relationship with the Chinese. It is just a bad way to begin with these guys.
                    Thirdly, it was wrong. It is the Chinese who should be on the defensive. It is
                    the Chinese who screwed things up, not the U.S. Their reaction was totally out
                    of bounds. It was the Chinese who had misbehaved.</p>
                <p>Fourth, even though the trip was said not to have gone well, the President at
                    least was getting credit with Congress and the press and human rights groups for
                    inviting dissidents to his banquet. They were saying at least he has the guts to
                    do this. So the background undercuts all his credit with the human rights and
                    congressional types by making clear that he was sorry this guy came to the
                    banquet and he hurt the Chinese feelings. Finally, and this was the least
                    important because I was leaving anyway, he had destroyed any possible influence
                    I could have in my remaining tenure as Ambassador. In effect he was saying to
                    the world and the Chinese this Ambassador is out of control, did something on
                    his own, didn't tell us about your reaction, and ruined my trip.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I sent this message to Scowcroft whom I had known for 15 years, who was a
                    relatively good friend and working colleague, who had praised the trip as being
                    sensational, etc. To this day, I have never had even an acknowledgment of the
                    message or explanation. Not one. I know he got it because I had the CIA confirm
                    to me the exact time they handed him the message in the Situation Room and the
                    exact time they handed it to Baker. Scowcroft didn't even have the courtesy to
                    say he got my cable and let's talk about it, or you're wrong for the following
                    reasons, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0539" n="Page0539"/>
                <p>Let me just finish by saying I have had a lot of bad moments in my career as well
                    as a hell of a lot of good ones. The Laos statement in 1970. The failure of the
                    Vietnam negotiations in October of 1972 when we went to Saigon and felt we had
                    an agreement, and President Thieu turned us down. I think this Fang affair ranks
                    at the bottom with those events, the combination of angst, disappointment, anger
                    at the Chinese and our President and his National Security Advisor, just
                    generally leaving a sour taste in my mouth.</p>
                <p>This issue faded as time passed. The Chinese got extremely friendly toward the
                    end of my stay - I left two months later. I am sure, however, because of
                    Democracy Salon and now this incident and this backgrounder, that Deng and
                    others had ambivalent feelings about me as well as Bette. By the time we left,
                    Bette and I got an incredible sendoff. For example, on the same day, I saw the
                    Secretary General, the Prime Minister, and the President. I had special meals in
                    my honor and special toasting and messages sent to me. The same with Bette. So
                    we got an incredibly warm sendoff by the Chinese. Also, back in the United
                    States, I figured most people knew the White House misbehaved, and were pissed
                    off at them, not me. I was a semi hero, beyond what I deserved, with the human
                    rights and congressional groups. I mellowed out more generally. But having said
                    that, obviously for the sake of the United States and the sake of President
                    Bush, and for my own reputation, I would have much preferred a glorious
                    Presidential trip to end my tenure in China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to put this in perspective, this is very early in
                        Bush'term.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's right, a few weeks after inauguration.</p>
                <p>Q: You also have George Bush who is probably has as good a r�sum� in foreign
                    affairs including going to China. It wasn't a Bill Clinton of Arkansas. Then,
                    Scowcroft who had been around the NSC for a long time, but in a way it sounds
                    very much like a brand new administration with new boys on the block who don't
                    really understand the game and so if anything happens you have to blame
                    somebody. It sounds like something out of the first couple of months of the
                    Reagan White House, also the first couple of months out of the Clinton White
                    House.</p>
                <p>LORD: I want to try to be as detached as I can. First, Scowcroft claimed and I
                    believe Baker claimed to me at some point, that nobody in their departments had
                    brought to their attention the list and the possible controversy. By the way,
                    Stape Roy was a hero in this. He was Deputy Assistant Secretary, one of the top
                    diplomats we've ever had. He stuck his neck out and backgrounded to the press,
                    talk about sticking your neck out, that the White House was all wet, but, in
                    fact, the list had been vetted by the White House and the State Department, and
                    he knew that Lord was not to blame. So Stape was a hero on that.</p>
                <pb facs="0540" n="Page0540"/>
                <p>First of all, we all underestimated the Chinese response. To this day I am
                    surprised by it, that with Fang to be at a big banquet at some obscure table,
                    they'd get this excited. Also, if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't do
                    it any differently. If you have a separate meeting, it is more provocative. If
                    you don't do anything, you are vulnerable back home, and you are not sending the
                    right signals to the Chinese or the Chinese people or the reformers whom you are
                    trying to help and give support to. Even if it were brought to the attention of
                    Baker and Scowcroft, they would have been told, as we suggested, the Chinese
                    would be unhappy about it, but the payoff is much larger than this, and it will
                    be under control essentially. We made clear that the dissidents in general might
                    be a problem. By the way, there were other dissidents in this controversy,
                    clearly people pushing the envelope that the Chinese never mentioned. Obviously
                    Deng Xiaoping had a particular thing for Fang.</p>
                <p>Part of the Bush reaction might have been that he felt he had not been informed.
                    Having said that, you would think, not that I wanted it to be this way, that the
                    President would get mad at his subordinates in Washington rather than his
                    Embassy if he feels he has a right to be mad at all which I don't think he does.
                    Moreover, I'm not even sure Bush, Baker, and Scowcroft didn't know. There was a
                    Camp David session with outside China experts before the trip. To this day I
                    have never gotten it straight. At least one or two of the participants told me
                    that the Fang invitation which as I say, had leaked by then, was a topic of
                    conversation among the outside experts. Who were at Camp David? Baker and
                    Scowcroft, at least I believe they were there, and the President. To this day I
                    don't know whether it came up in front of the President, if he knew, actually
                    did know about this, let alone Baker and Scowcroft. So, there is a little
                    confusion.</p>
                <p>Anyway, trying to be detached about it, here is the President. He is a brand new
                    President. He has a particular soft spot for China. Going there he expects a
                    triumphant homecoming which he got in every other way. He expects it to be a
                    wonderful personal experience for him and his wife, going back there, and a big
                    media plus, and getting off to a great start on foreign policy and generally on
                    his image, and instead this happens. You can see why I'm trying to be detached
                    about this. I just have to assume that he felt that we should have predicted
                    this more. What bothers me the most is he didn't get mad at the Chinese for
                    ruining his trip. He got mad at his own team. Now, I don't think it reveals lack
                    of experience in foreign policy which they both had, the two people you
                    mentioned and Baker, but frankly a clear softness on human rights, and a feeling
                    that we shouldn't do anything to ruffle the Chinese. The President, in fact, did
                    not raise human rights directly in his meetings with the Chinese at all. He got
                    Baker to do it the first night, but the President didn't raise it. Marlin
                    Fitzwater, the press spokesman, confirmed to the press that the President didn't
                    even raise human rights. We had to scramble and say he was going to church and
                    speaking about it on his radio and TV, and Baker raised it the first night.
                    Clearly, this softness was shown by the President's tepid response later to
                    Tiananmen Square.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think so, too, with Scowcroft...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0541" n="Page0541"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes, Scowcroft going over there secretly after the Tiananmen Square
                    massacre. So this is just a preview of their view on this subject.</p>
                <p>Q: [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Given this terrible experience, it is not very long
                    thereafter when you begin to get the demonstrations in the Square of the
                    students. Did this experience influence in any way the way the Embassy
                    understood what was going on and reported what was going on with the students?
                    Because obviously you couldn't have known what was going to come to begin with
                    on Tiananmen night. Was there a concern that there was an unwillingness in
                    Washington to hear about this? Does it have an impact do you think?</p>
                <p>LORD: We didn't pull our punches on reporting. That didn't affect our reporting.
                    Now, we couldn't predict Tiananmen Square. We clearly were made even more aware
                    by the Fang affair than we had been how sensitive Deng and the leadership were
                    to the human rights question. We clearly kept our eyes and ears open even more
                    for that. We did as we had done all along during my tenure, kept reporting on
                    the pushing of the envelope by the reformers. We kept in as much touch as we
                    could on that. I don't believe there was any direct correlation of any magnitude
                    between the Fang banquet issue and Tiananmen Square. It was just a symptom of
                    the sensitivity of the Chinese leadership and their repressive attitudes. Also
                    Deng's annoyance at Fang personally - I believe Fang had talked about corruption
                    under Deng.</p>
                <p>Q: [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: You are not getting anything when you are making
                    these early reports on what is happening in the Square, you are not getting any
                    responses from Washington that suggested you guys are doing it again?</p>
                <p>LORD: No, absolutely not. Just to make it clear, I left one week after the
                    Tiananmen demonstrations began. I left during the first big demonstration on
                    April 22, 100,000 people at Hu Yaobang's funeral. He had died on the 15th. In
                    the intervening week there had been posters and wreaths to Hu. The sentiment was
                    growing, and then they used the funeral as the first big occasion. We were
                    reporting this. I certainly did not think it was going to grow to the dimensions
                    it did, I don't know anybody who did. It grew to extraordinary dimensions, of
                    course. When people think of students in Tiananmen Square, what they forget is
                    in the first place there were seven weeks without a single incident of violence,
                    without a single death. If anything, the traffic ran better than ever. It was
                    the most orderly, responsive, disciplined crowd. Not one accident, not one
                    incident in seven weeks with a million people sometimes in the Square,
                    absolutely extraordinary. Furthermore, it was not just students. It was
                    journalists, academics, party members, military, business people, farmers,
                    peasants, workers, all kinds of people demonstrating, not just students. Now it
                    wasn't just about democracy. It was about inflation, corruption, nepotism, poor
                    conditions, physical and mental at the universities. There were a lot of
                    different sources of angst. It was in over 200 cities - not just Beijing - which
                    was extraordinary. None of which the scope of which we predicted.</p>
                <pb facs="0542" n="Page0542"/>
                <p>Q: But to take Nancy's question... I mean after all, an Embassy essentially just
                    consists of Foreign Service Officers who are looking at foreign governments and
                    trying to sense who are they, where are they going, and what are they doing. It
                    is so hard to turn that ability off when you look at your own government. Here
                    is a brand new government. Here is George Bush who sometimes had the view of not
                    being quite serious, you know, sort of a dilettante. He did this and he did
                    that, and saying you know, this is not that strong a President.</p>
                <p>LORD: Look, the Embassy and I personally were extremely mad at the President and
                    Scowcroft, although I am proud of the discipline we showed. There was never one
                    leak out of that Embassy complaining about Washington. The angst was confined to
                    my back channel messages which never got a response. Yes, we were mad, but first
                    of all he was the President. Number two, he was not a dilettante about foreign
                    policy. He was quite serious about it, knew a lot about it, had extensive
                    experience, and did some good work as the Gulf War showed. None of us thought
                    he'd suddenly become a lightweight. I didn't encourage a lot of griping and
                    whining at staff meetings. I can't tell you what went on around the water
                    cooler. We maintained discipline at staff meetings: look, we are going to show a
                    united front. I know how some of you feel. I know how I feel. It is unfair, but
                    we've got to serve the national interest and serve this President. That is all I
                    would say in front of others. With my wife and my DCM and one or two others I
                    was more frank one on one. I was hopping mad. No, our job was still, and I
                    really think I am being accurate on this, to not pull any punches either way in
                    our reporting, try to serve the President. I kept trying to stress - I worked
                    hard on this for a matter of weeks despite my other unhappiness - to put as
                    positive a spin on the trip as I could in terms of substance and perception and
                    kept urging Washington to do the same. Of course it was overcome by this event;
                    it never really recovered. So, it didn't really affect our reporting. I and
                    others were very angry and disappointed that the President would get mad both
                    inaccurately and just wrong in substance at the Embassy and have his Security
                    Advisor tell the world, as opposed to being mad at what the Chinese had done to
                    him.</p>
                <p>Q: Was it ever proposed that after this thing happened, I can see somebody else
                    reacting saying well why don't we have tea and cookies with Fang at some point.
                    You know if you are sticking it to me I mean talking to the Chinese, why don't
                    you come over and we'll have a midnight snack or something like that, or did
                    that even come up?</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, later he had to get refuge in the Embassy when my successor Jim
                    Lilley was there. I immediately saw Perry Link who was with him and went over
                    this with him and expressed our concern about Fang's well being. I think he was
                    surrounded and under house arrest by this point, so we could never get at him,
                    but I can't reconstruct what happened to him at that point. Basically he was
                    hemmed in. We didn't make any effort to have a high profile meeting with him. I
                    immediately went and made sure I saw his buddy and sent word to Fang about how
                    concerned I was. I met with Perry Link, the professor who had been with him, but
                    I didn't meet with Fang.</p>

                <p>Q: [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Do you have a sense in the Bush administration, Bush
                    himself considered himself somewhat of a China expert because of his experience
                    in China. Were there any other people at the very top that had any interest in
                    China, Scowcroft and these other people, or were they mostly Europe
                    oriented?</p>
                <p>LORD: That is a good question. Scowcroft was more arms control and Russia, but he
                    had been a generalist. He had been National Security Advisor under Ford after
                    all, so by definition he was a generalist, including China. He wasn't without
                    background on China certainly. Baker hadn't had much dealings with Asia
                    generally I believe or with China. There were plenty of good people like Stape
                    Roy and others back there working on it. I don't think there is any need to go
                    through the other parts of his trip. We hit some of the positive stuff. We
                    followed up. I was instructed immediately after the President left to go and ask
                    for an explanation and complain about what had happened, in addition to a
                    statement issued from the airplane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Were there other key policy
                        issues Buswas trying to resolve during the visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Resolve may be too strong a word. By the way, there was another positive
                    element in the lead up to the trip. They allowed the President to use his car
                    whenever he was riding without a Chinese official in it. For security reasons,
                    they never had allowed that before. It is just another little example of how
                    they went out of their way to be hospitable. In terms of the agenda, it was the
                    usual suspects, and the talks went very well. There were discussions on Russia,
                    on Japan. The Chinese raised Taiwan but not very vigorously. A discussion of
                    Chinese reforms and where they were going. Reminiscing about Bush's days in
                    China. Baker raised human rights and Tibet. When I say it went well, partly it
                    was because the reception was so terrific until that last incident, all these
                    other factors I've mentioned. The President also did address the Chinese people
                    which in those days was significant. They did have good discussions at the
                    beginning of the President's term sketching the future of U.S.-Chinese relations
                    and our common interests and talking about issues like Japan where he had just
                    come from, and Russia, and some of the other areas. There may well have been
                    some further movement on exchanges in bilateral agreements, but remember we only
                    had about a three weeks advance notice on this. He was a brand new President, so
                    the purpose was not to make breakthroughs, but to establish a positive tone to
                    the beginning of the relationship as he came into office.</p>
                <pb facs="0544" n="Page0544"/>
                <p>Before this, under Reagan, Secretary Shultz visited China a couple of times
                    during my tenure as did almost every other cabinet official. It was a sign of
                    the times and a fortunate window of opportunity we had during those years. We
                    had three different CIA directors coming in black hats. We had a couple of
                    Secretaries of Defense. Shultz was there twice. Almost every other cabinet level
                    economic type, not to mention directors of USIA and Peace Corps and all kinds of
                    Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, Congressional delegations which I
                    encouraged. High level visits from everyone from the Stock Exchange to President
                    Carter to Billy Graham to Kissinger to Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston. A great
                    variety. It made it a lot of fun and also helped to expand our relationship and
                    our bilateral links. Probably the single most positive visit and the most
                    important one was Secretary Shultz's trip from March 1 to March 6, 1987.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of '89?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Of 1987. He said afterwards, I think I got this from Dick Solomon who was
                    head of policy planning, this is the best foreign trip he had ever taken as
                    Secretary of State both from the standpoint of substance and logistics. He was
                    extremely pleased with the trip. I'm trying to be self serving like some other
                    people you talk to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: That's all right because I wrote
                        thbackground paper for his wife for that trip.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: You were there during that trip weren't you?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: You would agree it was a terrific trip.</p>
                <p>[Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: I actually didn't get to go on the trip,but I helped
                    advance it from Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0545" n="Page0545"/>
                <p>LORD: Anyway, it started out in Guilin on a boat trip, and he came to Beijing
                    where he met the Foreign Minister, Li Peng, the Vice Premier, the Defense
                    Minister, President Yang, Zhao Ziyang, who at that time was Party Secretary. Of
                    course he met with the Embassy staff. Deng Xiaoping. A couple of press
                    conferences and speeches and so on. He went up to Dalian and visited this
                    U.S.-sponsored institute training people in business and management. I pushed
                    hard for that visit, even though some were trying to drop it. Then he went on
                    down to Shandong and visited Mount Tai where you climb to the top and Qufu, the
                    birthplace of Confucius, and then out through Shanghai. It was a pretty long
                    trip for a Secretary of State in those days, about six days, March 1-6, 1987.
                    Indeed after the trip, even though it got extremely positive coverage, there was
                    some inquiry and carping about the expense, the number of people, and how long
                    he had been there. It's peanuts compared with other entourages since then, but
                    at the time it was a very minor flap, and we had to explain how important it
                    was.</p>
                <p>I had been back in Washington that January to help script the trip. If I do say
                    so we were pretty good on these high level trips, scene setters and think pieces
                    ahead of time and careful work by advance people, advice. I was with Shultz
                    every step of the way, helping him on this, as my wife was with Mrs. Shultz. It
                    was an important time, because as I pointed out earlier there were the Hu
                    Yaobang sacking and some tightening up and some other developments in our
                    relationship. There was less momentum, a slowing down in our relations before
                    this trip. I think this was an important one in terms of resuming that momentum.
                    It was the first trip as I say after Hu was sacked. On our domestic scene, we
                    had the Iran-Contra issue flaring up. Each side's domestic scene was a little
                    shaky. The strategic purpose of the trip, against the backdrop of these domestic
                    events, was to make sure that we moved forward again in our relationship and our
                    agenda on the bilateral front and to have in depth discussions on the
                    international issues which included Russia, Afghanistan, Indochina, Korea, the
                    Iran-Iraq War. Then a lot of emphasis on the economic agenda both in the
                    discussions and the meeting at the Dalian Institute and the McDonnell-Douglas
                    plane factory in Shanghai and so on. Also he saw many parts of the country. He
                    gave a couple of important speeches and toasts, including on American values
                    like Reagan had done at Fudan, and I stressed that was important to do. Also a
                    careful formulation on Taiwan which in effect said we would welcome any progress
                    between Taiwan and Beijing. We had some formulations. They were not dramatically
                    new. They didn't upset Taiwan, but they gave some encouragement to the Chinese
                    about our position. I did recommend that he not do this on Taiwan at the
                    beginning of his trip in Beijing. It might get so much attention that it would
                    dominate the rest of his trip, but rather do it in Shanghai toward the end.</p>
                <pb facs="0546" n="Page0546"/>
                <p>Since there was some obvious debate going on in China among the leadership on
                    political reform given what had happened in preceding months, I warned the
                    Secretary not to be snowed by what would inevitably be a show of unity and
                    solidarity by the Chinese leaders. I pointed out the tensions in the wake of the
                    Hu fall. I urged him, and he did do this much more than Bush was to do later, to
                    state carefully both in his public speeches and his private remarks, that the
                    gathering repression or the falling back on the liberalization however modest,
                    was not good for China, and also wasn't good for American opinion. It was
                    important to the relationship, discussion among the media, academics, and
                    Congressmen. Many of the latter, Congressmen and academics, were beginning to
                    send letters on treatments of intellectuals and artists. There was a contrast in
                    China to the developing positive events in Russia under Gorbachev. The Secretary
                    did raise some of these themes.</p>
                <p>The Chinese didn't react negatively.</p>
                <p>I had a lot of talks with the Secretary privately about the Washington scene. At
                    another time, by the way, the Secretary was in the middle of the Iran-Contra
                    debate. As you may recall, at some point Poindexter had been fired and the Tower
                    Commission had been set up. Also we listened to the President's speech on this
                    issue, on the train between Shandong and Shanghai. But at one point, there were
                    rumors that Shultz was thinking of resigning, and I had sent him a private very
                    personal message, literally personal. It must have been through CIA close hold
                    channel urging him to stay on and why I thought it was important and his
                    contributions and so on. Obviously, I didn't turn him around myself, but I know
                    he appreciated that. It was important to send such a message.</p>
                <p>So, I felt this trip did provide new momentum in the relationship. Both sides
                    could say that despite our somewhat uneasy domestic scenes, we can and we will
                    move ahead. We agreed with the Chinese on new contacts with the North Koreans
                    through our respective Embassies in Beijing, trying to encourage north-south
                    dialogues. We began to preview how we might begin to liberalize some exports of
                    technology, again if Beijing behaved itself in other areas. We agreed to a PRC
                    Consulate in Los Angeles. We got some movement in reciprocity issues of interest
                    to us. Shultz gave a good rundown on U.S.-Russian relations. We relayed to the
                    Chinese Foreign Minister and economic ministers and others our concerns about
                    business, trade, and investment problems. None of this is necessarily dramatic,
                    but it gave substance as well as logistic smoothness to a very complicated trip.
                    One of the Secretary's secretarial staff said it was the most complicated
                    Secretarial trip they had. I was really proud of the performance of our embassy
                    and consulates.</p>
                <p>Let me now return to the end of my tenure as Ambassador.</p>
                <pb facs="0547" n="Page0547"/>
                <p>In the wake of the Bush trip and for the remainder of my stay, there was still
                    obviously continuing ferment for political reform and dissent. I don't want to
                    exaggerate this, but clearly the debate was continuing and we were reporting on
                    this. Nobody I'm aware of either inside or outside of China predicted or could
                    have known of the size of the demonstrations that were about to come.</p>
                <p>As we were saying our good-byes, we had a tremendous sendoff, lots of parties and
                    the usual speeches and so on. We had one party for Chinese at our house on April
                    15, a week before we were leaving. We heard at that party that Hu Yaobang had
                    died. This is in Bette's book, Legacies, at the beginning. Little did we know
                    that was to be a signal for a major event in Chinese history. Hu had always been
                    known as someone unpredictable and spontaneous, feisty, unlike most stodgy
                    Chinese leaders, and had been liberal on political reform and Tibet and related
                    issues. In retrospect he was built up as even more of a liberal hero than was
                    actually the case. In any event, Chinese intellectuals and students saw him as
                    someone who was hopeful. They were unhappy to say the least about his having
                    been sacked a couple years earlier, as well as the continuing lack of real
                    political reform in China. Thus, starting relatively slowly but building up
                    quickly, people reacted to his death by circulating poems and posters and
                    wreaths to his honor, and people began to demonstrate in Tiananmen Square in
                    relatively modest numbers. A state funeral was ordered for Tiananmen Square on
                    April 22, the day Bette and I were leaving China, by coincidence. On that day
                    there was a huge, very big crowd of roughly 100,000 people with the excuse of
                    paying tribute to Hu but also beginning to demonstrate on behalf of greater
                    freedom and democracy, against corruption, against nepotism, for better
                    conditions in school and universities etc. We were reporting this fully, of
                    course, but I felt as I left, although this was very significant obviously, I
                    had no idea that it would mushroom and get to the point that it did. Let alone
                    the massacre a couple of months later. Indeed Bette and I went on from China,
                    had a stop in Singapore, and were invited to a private dinner around his pool by
                    Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yu, who I had known favorably off and on. He asked me in
                    this private dinner with all his leadership what was going to happen in China. I
                    said that I thought it was significant, but controllable and manageable -
                    showing how prescient I was.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I think we really are talking about something that even at the time, to
                    me it was fairly obvious as an unknowledgeable person about the thing, that this
                    was something that a moderately apt leadership could deal with. You know, you
                    see some people; you do some things. You could have turned this thing off.</p>
                <pb facs="0548" n="Page0548"/>
                <p>LORD: Absolutely. One reason I was so outraged by the massacre was that it was
                    unnecessary. Particularly in the early part of this, the first couple of weeks,
                    the actual requests by the students and others were very modest, essentially to
                    have a dialog with the government. There were some stunted dialogue with Li Peng
                    and others, but basically they were not asking for anything revolutionary. There
                    were occasional signs that were insulting, but basically it was obviously very
                    peaceful. As I said earlier, no violent incidents or death in 49 days. And it
                    was all walks of life so clearly it was important. A leadership that had its act
                    together and was moderately inclined could have defused this thing. I remain
                    convinced of that to this day. Obviously there was debate in the Politburo. They
                    were paralyzed as to how to respond. There were those, probably Li Peng and some
                    of the military from the beginning who felt that any demonstration however
                    peaceful in the center of Tiananmen Square with all its history was either
                    inherently dangerous or symbolically dangerous. They ought to squash it right
                    away. There were others like Zhao Ziyang and some other generals including a
                    former Minister of Defense who wrote to the leadership saying don't use force.
                    They thought they ought to meet the students part way. They were paralyzed, and
                    when Gorbachev came, they felt particularly insulted because they couldn't greet
                    him at Tiananmen Square. They had to greet him at the airport. What was supposed
                    to be a major rapprochement with Russia was overshadowed by the demonstrations.
                    In front of worldwide media attention. That made them mad. They held off until
                    Gorbachev's visit because they didn't want to make a big incident beforehand.
                    They began to tighten the screws after that. The history is familiar to
                    everyone. I don't have to go through it.</p>
                <p>Personally, it turns out by coincidence my wife had to double back to China. A
                    few months earlier when we knew we were leaving, Don Hewitt of 60 Minutes
                    visited China and knew then that Gorbachev was coming in May to see the Chinese
                    which was a major event that CBS and the other networks were going to cover. So,
                    they asked my wife, knowing we'd be gone by then, whether she would come back
                    and be a commentator on television on the Gorbachev visit, essentially giving
                    background pieces on Chinese culture and history and so on. We checked this out
                    carefully with the White House and the State Department to make sure there was
                    no problem with the wife of a former Ambassador doing this. It was clear from
                    the beginning that she wouldn't be identified as such. She would just be
                    identified as a Chinese-American author. They said fine. We thought it would be
                    a totally conventional nice puff piece type of thing, and she'd come back to
                    China for that.</p>
                <pb facs="0549" n="Page0549"/>
                <p>Well, by the time we left, this thing had heated up and CBS wanted her back right
                    away. She had made the commitment, but she had no idea she would be covering
                    such an historical event. So, after Singapore, she went back to China and I went
                    back to the U.S. She was a commentator on CBS until late May when she left
                    thinking the crisis was over. The numbers in the Square were dwindling, getting
                    down to a few thousand. The authorities clearly could have declared victory and
                    gotten out, but they wanted to move in a show of force. People know the history.
                    She was there commentating almost every day, and she was there when the Chinese
                    pulled the plug on the feed to CBS. She acted as interpreter for Dan Rather and
                    stalled as much as she could until he got there; they did have to deal with him
                    rather than a producer. She did a fabulous job as commentator, but always
                    identified only as an author.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile I went back to Washington and was deluged by the media once I left the
                    State Department. I appeared on all the major TV, radio shows, in which I
                    supported the Administration. In support of the demonstrations, I expressed the
                    hope that the Chinese government would act with restraint and meet the students
                    and other protesters halfway with their reasonable demands, but of course, was
                    very tough in my statements after the massacre. Having said that, I still felt
                    we ought to stay engaged with China as I said in an earlier interview. Over the
                    summer I wrote, and that fall, I published in Foreign Affairs magazine an
                    article called “The Big Chill” which was very tough on the Chinese on Tiananmen
                    Square and the lack of political reform, but also pointed out why political
                    reform was in their self interest and not just a favor to us. Then I made the
                    case that while pressing human rights we should continue to engage China and
                    move ahead with the relationship.</p>
                <p>As I have said elsewhere there were tremendous exchanges of delegations and
                    visitors and negotiations and agreements throughout my period as Ambassador. We
                    were lucky to have this positive window. Without trying to give an exhaustive
                    list of any kind, let me give an example of a couple of months period. In the
                    spring and summer of 1987 the following happened. These are just the major
                    events, not Assistant Secretary and below level or other events. In a two to
                    three month period we had a ministerial level meeting of the Joint Commission on
                    Science and Technology; a visit by CINCPAC; a visit by former President Carter;
                    a visit by the Attorney General, Ed Meese; Henry Grunwald, the editor in chief
                    of Time magazine; Pam Harriman leading a delegation; Brent Scowcroft, former
                    National Security Advisor; Henry Kissinger; Charles Wick, head of USIA; Senator
                    Cranston; several other congressional delegations; the U.S. Air Force Band;
                    Ambassador Walters, our UN Ambassador; Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day
                    O'Connor; former Ambassador Anne Armstrong for security matters; Tom Brokaw in
                    an NBC special on China; and a few other assorted events. This gives you an
                    example of the kind of pace that we had and the interesting and positive
                    exchanges.</p>

                <p>[Kennedy] Today is August 7, 1998. Nancy Bernkopf Tucker is with us and will be
                    asking some questions concerning filling in on China. Could you explain what the
                    student demonstrations were, when they happened, and then how you dealt with
                    them?</p>
                <p>LORD: We actually covered a great deal of that, but not with any great precision,
                    partly because of my memory and partly because, by coincidence, I was actually
                    in the United States at the time. So just to go over it and at the risk of some
                    repetition I should say that at the end of 1986 there were demonstrations in
                    Shanghai by students. As I recall, these dealt with the typical student issues
                    of greater academic freedom, corruption, and inflation, probably political
                    issues as well. These demonstrations were thought to have been partly inspired
                    by Fang Lizhi and other scholars who were debating these issues at the time. As
                    I recall, there was no bloodshed, but there were widespread demonstrations. I
                    only remember their taking place in Shanghai. By coincidence, I was in the
                    United States on vacation at the time. I kept in very close touch with this
                    development in case it developed into something more serious.</p>
                <p>However, what was most significant was the fallout in terms of Chinese domestic
                    policy. Hu Yaobang was then Secretary of the Communist Party of China. He was
                    known even then and, of course, has been known, in retrospect, to have been more
                    progressive on political reforms than most Chinese leaders. As a result of these
                    student demonstrations, there was debate in the Politburo of the Party on
                    responsibility for the unrest. As a result, Deng Xiaoping sacked Hu at some
                    point in the succeeding months.</p>
                <p>We in the Embassy, of course, covered these demonstrations at the time as matters
                    of great significance. In retrospect, they were something like a tremor in
                    advance of the earthquake in June, 1989, which none of us, as I've said
                    elsewhere, would have predicted would occur on such a large scale. Again, as I
                    recall, the earlier demonstration in 1986 was fairly peaceful.</p>
                <p>Of course, the sacking of Hu Yaobang was very important because he was the heir
                    apparent to Deng, as the Secretary of the Communist Party. Deng had already
                    taken himself out of day to day operations, though he was still the number one
                    person in China by far. There were several reasons for the sacking of Hu. First,
                    Deng had always had a balancing act of including more progressive people like Hu
                    and Ziao Ziyang in the leadership as well as more conservative people like Li
                    Peng. Deng had to watch the balance. Deng himself may have felt somewhat
                    vulnerable from the conservatives, because of the unrest. Therefore, he threw Hu
                    to the wolves. We felt that that was one element in play.</p>
                <pb facs="0551" n="Page0551"/>
                <p>Secondly, Deng was convinced, to some degree, of the dangers of liberalism. This
                    was not just opportunism to protect himself. Deng had never been notably in
                    favor of liberalization of the regime. He was very conservative on this front,
                    even as he had been very receptive to economic reforms and on the opening to the
                    outside world. Thus, Deng probably felt that Hu had gone too far. Deng himself
                    had been concerned about the unrest. After all, he was Mao Zedong's right hand
                    man in the anti-rightist campaign. He was to be, in fact, the author of the
                    Tienanmen massacre.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, Deng was probably a little uncomfortable with Hu's style. Hu was
                    spontaneous and feisty and said what he believed. He was much more colorful and
                    unpredictable than most Chinese leaders. This had led to some complaints among
                    the Chinese leadership.</p>
                <p>So I think that there was a mix of reasons for sacking Hu Yaobang. Also in the
                    succeeding months, it was not just a question of sacking Hu; there was a general
                    process of tightening up under way. As I said earlier, in this period of the
                    late 1980s there was considerable discussion among academics, scholars,
                    students, and writers, many of whom we met in the Embassy, and particularly
                    through my wife's contacts as well as those of the Embassy, about political
                    reform and about the need to open up on that front. There seemed to be more
                    tolerance on these issues in China. So there was that kind of ferment at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>However, in the wake of these Shanghai demonstrations, not only was Hu sacked but
                    they undertook some of these conservative, ideological campaigns. I believe that
                    these campaigns included the “Four Cardinal Principles.” Don't ask me to repeat
                    these socialist tenets, but that was one thing that they did. There were also
                    campaigns against spiritual pollution and bourgeois liberalization, guarding
                    against peaceful evolution, which was their code word for Western and foreign
                    ideas undermining Marxist and Communist political principles. There was a
                    tightening up in the cultural field, as well, during this period. That campaign
                    lasted for several months.</p>
                <p>Q: [Bernkopf] Could you say anything about what some American leaders thought
                    about China, but not of other countries? I'm thinking particularly here about
                    former Secretary of State George Shultz. Do you have any sense of what his views
                    were and how important he thought China was, particularly in terms of China
                    versus Japan?</p>
                <pb facs="0552" n="Page0552"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes. Secretary Shultz was clearly in favor of engagement with China. He
                    recognized the strategic as well as the economic importance of dealing with
                    China. He recognized that in the next century China will be increasingly
                    important. He saw the impact of China on regional and global issues, as well as
                    the very extensive, bilateral interests we had in China, including the economic
                    area, which is of particular concern to Shultz. Like any responsible, American
                    leader, he didn't like the Chinese political system and felt that human rights
                    were a legitimate part of our agenda. However, he also didn't feel that the
                    Chinese-American relationship should be held hostage to this issue. Therefore,
                    he would raise it and we would raise it and press on it, evenas we hoped for
                    progress. We thought that this was in China's own self-interest, involving
                    economic reform and opening up China to the outside world, with the U.S. and
                    others encouraging this trend. We realized that we would have to move ahead with
                    an imperfect regime because of our other interests to promote this broader
                    agenda.</p>
                <p>So I would say, in terms of the current debate, that now he should speak for
                    himself. However, I believe that Shultz would be closer to the Bush and
                    Kissinger viewpoint, and now the current Clinton viewpoint. He would differ from
                    those in Congress who would attach a higher priority to the human rights
                    dimension. He would not ignore human rights but he would stress the need for
                    engagement with China.</p>
                <p>Q: [Bernkopf] He had trouble with other members of the Reagan administration over
                    Iran-Contra issues. Was China ever such a contentious issue?</p>
                <p>LORD: I don't recall that China was ever an issue for debate during the Reagan
                    administration during my time of service. There were periodic debates on China
                    policy during the early part of this administration, which other persons can
                    document. Reagan came into office as being pro-Taiwan and, obviously, a
                    first-class anti-communist. Al Haig came in as Secretary of State, after having
                    worked with Kissinger on the opening to China. He clearly pressed Reagan in a
                    more positive direction. I am sure that there was a lot of debate in the Reagan
                    administration over the Shanghai Communique of 1982, which defused the arms
                    sales question. The Chinese put the heat on this issue during the early part of
                    the first Reagan administration.</p>
                <p>You will recall that around the end of 1985 I arrived in China as Ambassador,
                    following my previous position as President of the Council on Foreign Relations.
                    By the time I arrived in China, we had signed the 1982 Communiqu� and President
                    Reagan had been to China. He had spoken very firmly on values but also urged the
                    development of the Chinese-American relationship. The atmosphere eased greatly,
                    both in bilateral terms and even, to a certain extent, within China. By then
                    there was unanimity within the Reagan administration on China policy, although
                    there may have been some disagreement on particular, tactical issues or
                    negotiations. However, on the general strategy of engagement, even though we
                    kept in mind our values, I don't recall that there was any real dispute on China
                    policy at any time.</p>
                <pb facs="0553" n="Page0553"/>
                <p>Q: [Bernkopf] I remember that I worked in the Department of State at that time.
                    The way we described the Chinese-American relationship was that it had matured
                    to a point where we anticipated that nothing could derail it again. So I think
                    that this was a period of great optimism for those of us who were working on
                    Chinese affairs.</p>
                <p>LORD: I think that, as I've said previously, it's not that we didn't have
                    problems with Chinese policy, tough negotiations, or some problems with human
                    rights in China or Tibet. However, on the whole, during this period we were
                    greatly expanding our contacts and our constituencies regarding the relationship
                    on both sides. There were high level visits and negotiations. So it was the most
                    positive period in our relations from the Nixon opening right up to today.</p>
                <p>Q: [Bernkopf] Along those lines, and you may already have answered this question,
                    but just to be specific, what was the attitude of Paul Wolfowitz, who has
                    emerged more recently as a critic of Clinton administration policy toward China?
                    I think that he left the Department of State in 1986 or 1987.</p>
                <p>LORD: He was Assistant Secretary for East Asian Affairs during the first part of
                    my tenure in China as Ambassador. Then Gaston Sigur was Assistant Secretary for
                    East Asian Affairs after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Bernkopf] Could you talk about both of them in terms of
                        theiviews on China and maybe then any differences in operating style?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: First, it's only fair that they speak for themselves, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] I have interviewed Gaston Sigur but I
                        haven'interviewed Paul Wolfowitz.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Let me say right off, and this is not to show happy collegiality, that I
                    don't recall any distinctive, real debates with Paul Wolfowitz or Gaton Sigur.
                    Sometimes, Paul and I would tangle on personnel matters or things like that.
                    However, I had very good relations with both Wolfowitz and Sigur. They are both
                    very bright and both in favor of the opening to China. I think that both of them
                    put a great deal of emphasis on geopolitical, security, and strategic aspects of
                    U.S. relations with China, and not just the economic aspects. At the time the
                    economic aspects were of growing importance but nowhere near as important as
                    they are today. Both Wolfowitz and Sigur were concerned with human rights, but,
                    again, although these were an important part of our agenda, they were not enough
                    to hold up the development of our whole relationship with China. So I don't
                    recall any significant differences with either one of them or with the views of
                    either one of them.</p>
                <pb facs="0554" n="Page0554"/>
                <p>I think that both Wolfowitz and Sigur were concerned at all times that we should
                    not undermine Taiwan. I know that they were both firm on that front, as I was,
                    as well. This is not a very interesting answer, but I believe that it is
                    accurate.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] I don't recall your mentioning it but, for the record, I recall that
                    both Wolfowitz and Sigur were Assistant Secretaries of State for East Asian
                    Affairs.</p>
                <p>LORD: They were Assistant Secretaries of State during the first ansecond parts of
                    my tenure as Ambassador to China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Bernkopf] Were there any significant differences between
                        thestwo men in operating style that are worth noting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Nothing that really jumps out at me. They are obviously different
                    personalities. Paul Wolfowitz is a more dynamic and blunt type. Gaston Sigur is
                    more soft spoken and gentlemanly, but that doesn't mean that he doesn't have
                    strong views. In terms of dealing with the Embassy in Beijing, on a day to day
                    basis, and this is natural and correct, our work with the Department was most
                    often either with the Country Desk or with the Deputy Assistant Secretary in
                    charge of Chinese Affairs, who in this case was J. Stapleton Roy, who did an
                    outstanding job. He was a solid supporter, as I was of his in the mid-'90s when
                    he was Ambassador to China and I was Assistant Secretary.</p>
                <p>So, on a day to day basis, I would deal most often and directly with Stape Roy.
                    This was only natural, as the Assistant Secretary himself has to cover the whole
                    East Asian region. I dealt with Stape Roy more than with either Gaston Sigur or
                    Paul Wolfowitz. I couldn't have had a better back up than Stape Roy, in terms of
                    intelligence, loyalty, openness, and deep knowledge. In addition, I had very
                    cooperative and solid backup in the Pentagon led by Rich Armitage, who was
                    Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. Jim Kelly,
                    and others were also helpful. I would consult closely with all of them when I
                    was home, and we all worked together very well.</p>
                <p>Q: [Bernkopf] You mentioned Taiwan. I just wanted to say, and perhaps this is the
                    last thing I would want to mention, that this was the beginning of a period of
                    tremendous change in Taiwan. That is, it was the beginning of the process of
                    democratization and of real change. This was a change which, one can even argue,
                    completely altered our perspective on Taiwan. Suddenly, Taiwan became what we
                    always wanted it to be, with an open, democratic process.</p>
                <p>How skeptical were people in charge in the State Department and you, as
                    Ambassador to China, about these changes in Taiwan? How much of a surprise were
                    they? How much of an impact did they make in terms of your view of the balance
                    between China and Taiwan?</p>
                <pb facs="0555" n="Page0555"/>
                <p>LORD: I can't speak for others, but my own view was, first, that I was not
                    skeptical of these changes in Taiwan. On the contrary, I was encouraged by the
                    changes in Taiwan. Chiang Ching-kuo was followed as President of China by Lee
                    Teng-hui.</p>
                <p>Chiang Ching-kuo had started in the right direction. He was able to do that
                    because he had the mantle of his father, Chiang Kai-shek, so he could hardly be
                    accused of doing anything against him. In a sense, Chiang Ching-kuo opened doors
                    on the political process. It was easier for him to do this because he was part
                    of his family. Therefore, this protected him against opposition and legitimized
                    the great, further steps that his successor, Lee Teng-hui, took. It also made it
                    possible for someone born in Taiwan (Lee) to be the leader of the country. So,
                    Chiang Ching-kuo's contribution was very significant. I forget when he died, but
                    his contribution was very meaningful. Although they weren't close to open
                    elections in Taiwan while I was Ambassador to China, the Taiwanese were clearly
                    moving in the right direction.</p>
                <p>I was not skeptical about the changes in Taiwan. I was encouraged. I also felt,
                    even as I do today, that these changes, if not inevitable, were predictable. In
                    my view we have seen economic progress in Asia and the aspirations of the middle
                    class reflect the universal principle that man or woman does not live by rice
                    alone. This process has been at work in Taiwan as well.</p>
                <p>I was consistently in favor of maintaining strong, unofficial ties with Taiwan
                    and not giving in to unreasonable Chinese demands, even as we balanced off our
                    interests with mainland China. So my own views certainly didn't change. I felt
                    that we had a moral and historical connection to Taiwan in any event and that we
                    should stand by our friends. If anything, of course, their movement toward a
                    freer political system reinforced my view that we should strongly support Taiwan
                    even as we moved ahead with China. I believe that six American presidents of
                    both political parties have done very well in carrying out this balancing
                    act.</p>
                <p>I don't recall now the impact the changes in Taiwan had on China. These changes
                    didn't affect our policy. We have pursued a consistent policy which had been set
                    out by previous administrations, in which I served. Taiwan has always been a key
                    issue with the mainland Chinese. There is no way that you could have a high
                    level meeting with the mainland Chinese without the Taiwan question coming
                    up.</p>
                <pb facs="0556" n="Page0556"/>
                <p>My recollection of that period when I was Ambassador to China is that the Taiwan
                    issue was not as hot as it is today or was, when we opened diplomatic relations
                    with mainland China or during the early years of the Reagan Administration. The
                    Taiwan issue was always there, but the mainland Chinese were already deploying
                    troops away from the coast facing Taiwan and were concerned about the Polar Bear
                    to the North [i.e., Russia] and the Vietnamese to the South. As I recall it, the
                    rhetoric concerning Taiwan was obviously unpleasant but not at a very high
                    decibel level. Taiwan was not an issue that they kept beating us over the head
                    with at our various meetings. Taiwan has always been and will continue to be a
                    key issue in our relations with China. However, I felt that throughout this
                    period it was quite a manageable matter.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] I would have thought that you belonged to the Kissinger school of
                    realpolitik. In this context Taiwan, as a rather small area, has really been
                    screwing things up with China by doing exactly what we would want and would
                    aspire to have them do. However, the gap between what Taiwan has been and what
                    it is becoming has been growing. It's going to be harder and harder for the
                    United States and the world to refuse to accord recognition to Taiwan. I would
                    think that, in terms of policy planning and looking at the matter with the cold
                    eye of what's in it for us, this, in a way, would be a disturbing development.
                    Did you find this to be a consideration?</p>
                <p>LORD: No, not at all. I really felt that the changes in Taiwan were - and are -
                    an encouraging development. They are good for the people of Taiwan. Initially,
                    we didn't have as extensive a debate as we have had in recent years on universal
                    versus so-called Asian values. This is a phoney debate and Taiwan's move toward
                    democracy proves that. I think that these changes in Taiwan are not only good
                    for Taiwan itself but are a good example generally in the world, in Asia, and to
                    show that Chinese people want freedom, too - a strong message to the mainland.I
                    don't recall Congressional sentiment bubbling up about a need to be more
                    pro-Taiwan and anti-mainland China because Taiwan was becoming freer, and
                    mainland China wasn't. I don't think that the Taiwan issue really complicated
                    our policy toward China while I was Ambassador. Above all, speaking personally,
                    I've always set great store about promoting our values. I've been insistent on
                    that. Clearly, I also have geopolitical instincts since I worked for Kissinger
                    and I think that these are legitimate. However, you have to balance off these
                    considerations. My only reaction to these changes in Taiwan is a feeling of
                    pleasure for the people of Taiwan. If anything, these changes might encourage
                    political liberalization in China, at least in a modest way. Now of course you
                    could argue that Deng Xiaoping and others who are more conservative might see
                    developments in Taiwan as a threat to their position. However, I think that they
                    were looking more particularly at what was happening in mainland China.</p>
                <p>It is hard to judge the impact of what has been happening in Taiwan on the people
                    in China. I suspect that Taiwan developments didn't have much of an impact on
                    them in the past. You should recall that when I was Ambassador to China the
                    authorities in Taiwan were loosening up, but they had by no means reached the
                    point of free elections. So the situation in Taiwan had by no means approached
                    the dramatic point which it reached by the early 1990s.</p>
                <pb facs="0557" n="Page0557"/>
                <p>Q: [Bernkopf] I would like to raise one more issue and that is the situation in
                    Korea. This was also a period when the Chinese were moving toward developing
                    diplomatic relations with South Korea. I was wondering to what, if any, extent
                    the mainland Chinese have tried to bring the American Embassy into this process
                    in terms of how you saw it and what you thought the implications were, as well
                    as whether you worried about what the North Koreans would do in the event of
                    normalization of diplomatic relations between China and South Korea.</p>
                <p>LORD: I would like to make a couple of comments on Korea. First, South Korean
                    diplomacy was very skillful. Events started moving toward improved relations
                    with China toward the latter part of my tenure as Ambassador to China. I think
                    that in this context one of the key events was the Olympic Games in Seoul in
                    1988. Both mainland China and Russia agreed to attend the Seoul Olympic Games.
                    The Eastern European countries agreed to attend as well.</p>
                <p>Basically, by that time the economic performance of South Korea was terrific, and
                    the poor economic performance of North Korea was becoming clear. South Korea was
                    eclipsing North Korea after starting out, perhaps behind it in the 1950s or even
                    in the 1960s. South Korea was being recognized by more and more countries.
                    Sometimes this involved dual recognition and sometimes it involved recognition
                    just of South Korea. In particular this involved communist countries. The Seoul
                    Olympic Games brought a major breakthrough, both in terms of general prestige
                    but also in achieving attendance at the games and furthering diplomacy behind
                    the scenes with the Russians, the Chinese, and the Eastern Europeans. So this
                    was just the beginning of the mainland Chinese exploring better ties with the
                    South Koreans.</p>
                <p>Both the mainland Chinese and the Russians were very careful about their North
                    Korean flank at this point, although North Korea was clearly unhappy about
                    mainland Chinese and Russian attendance at the Seoul Olympic Games.</p>
                <p>The other side of this situation was that the U.S. was exploring improved
                    contacts with North Korea as well, in close consultation with South Korea. My
                    view is that South Korea ought to take the lead in this process. We had some
                    initial contacts in Beijing through our political section. I believe that Ray
                    Burghardt was the key contact with the North Koreans. These contacts never
                    really got anywhere, but they were the first contacts that I can recall taking
                    place. These initial contacts probably took place in 1988, although I would have
                    to check that.</p>
                <p>On our way to the airport on April 22, our second faithful Chinese driver gave
                    Bette and me a photo album of demonstrations for Zhou En-lai in Tiananmen Square
                    in 1976, with preserved leaves included. He asked us to keep this gift secret.
                    Our first driver (also for Bush) had been retired by the Chinese the year
                    before. He cried on his last day. He died soon after. The Chinese didn't allow
                    me to go to his funeral. For further personal accounts of our stay in China, I
                    recommend “Legacies - A Chinese Mosaic” by my wife.</p>
                <pb facs="0558" n="Page0558"/>
                <p>The day before I left Beijing (April 21), I sent a final cable which I personally
                    drafted summing up the state of U.S.-Chinese relations. I enclose here the full
                    text.</p>
                <p>Farewell Cable From Ambassador Lord on April 21, 1989</p>
                <p>From Ambassador Winston Lord to Washington and key posts.</p>
                <p>Ref: Beijing 3855</p>
                <p>1. (Confidential - Entire text.)</p>
                <p>2. I depart Beijing tomorrow with both a solid sense of progress and an awareness
                    of fresh challenges in the relationship between the United States and the
                    People's Republic of China. These are the themes sounded in my farewell meetings
                    with China's top leadership, notably an April 19 tripleheader with the
                    President, the Premier, and the General Secretary. Much of the progress is due
                    to world events, Washington policies, USUN efforts, the private sector or just
                    plain serendipity. The Chinese, of course, have made their own great efforts.
                    This embassy and our consulates, I believe, have also played their part. The
                    challenges - and indeed some tension - will be perpetual as befits two such
                    contrasting nations. But some of our new problems flow from past success. And
                    they will be resolved or managed if the Chinese and we act wisely, recognizing
                    that our common interests clearly outweigh our inevitable differences.3. This
                    message will focus on the concrete and programmatic in our bilateral relations.
                    For my analysis of China's foreign policy and domestic scene, I refer the
                    interested reader to the personal scenesetter I wrote for President Bush's
                    February visit (reftel). In that paper, I stated that China was prospering in
                    the world while floundering at home. There weeks from now Gorbachev and Deng
                    will clasp hands. In a few hours as I head for the airport there will be a
                    memorial service for Hu Yaobang near Tiananmen Square, filled for days with
                    protesting students. Progress.</p>
                <p>4. Since November 1985 Sino-American relations have greatly advanced and further
                    matured. The foundations have been broadened and deepened in a wide variety of
                    fields. Highlights and recommendations include the following.</p>
                <p>5. Visits.</p>
                <p>A steady two-way stream of high-level and working-level visitors, most notably
                    President Bush, has provided impetus, enriched perspectives, nurtured personal
                    links, and strengthened domestic support for a positive relationship. Such
                    exchanges, including distinguished private citizens, will remain crucial. In
                    particular we should continue to encourage congressional delegations, given the
                    many issues involving Capitol Hill.</p>
                <p>6. Political dialogue.</p>
                <pb facs="0559" n="Page0559"/>
                <p>Our discussions with Beijing on international topics have changed the PRC
                    position on Silkworms, generated greater Chinese responsibility on ballistic
                    missiles, and substantially modified their approach to the Khmer Rouge in
                    Cambodia. The Chinese, in turn, (along with Japan and South Korea) helped to
                    improve our posture on the INF agreement. We have closely compared notes on the
                    Soviet Union and provided mutual reassurance. We have enhanced collaboration or
                    CONFIDENTIAL Section 02 10 Beijing 11017.Comprehension in other areas such as
                    Afghanistan, the Gulf War, and Korea, where the Chinese have facilitated our
                    dialogue here with the North Koreans. The Chinese have somewhat moderated their
                    Third World rhetoric and become more cooperative at the United Nations. They
                    have relaxed their positions toward some of our friends, such as Israel and
                    South Korea. On Central America Beijing has been more sensitive to our concerns
                    and even tossed a bouquet at our latest initiative. We have successfully managed
                    the Taiwan question.</p>
                <p>7. In some areas, of course, it has been hard going or worse. Prominent examples
                    include Tibet, population policy, and human rights generally. On others there
                    are promising beginnings, such as dugs and arms control, or potential for
                    initiating exchanges, such as on terrorism and the environment.</p>
                <p>8. Overall, as the President and Chinese leaders recently agreed, we need to make
                    our dialogue on international topics even more systematic at the working
                    level.</p>
                <p>9. Economic cooperation.</p>
                <p>Nowhere has our growth been more impressive. Annual trade has leapt 100 percent
                    the past three years, exceeding $14 billion in 1988. Agricultural sales have
                    risen from negligible levels to $1.2 billion this year. We are China's second
                    largest export market and, with $3.4 billion committed, the leading investing
                    country. Our export controls on technology have been significantly eased in
                    recent years and yesterday we reached agreement that will include China in our
                    distribution system. We have continued to implement the trade development
                    program, over 25 percent of whose budget has been dedicated to feasibility
                    studies for major Chinese projects. During the past three years we have forged
                    new agreements on civil aviation, taxes, textiles and maritime cooperation.</p>
                <pb facs="0560" n="Page0560"/>
                <p>10. The record is mixed at best on other economic fronts. The investment climate
                    has been substantially improved since 1985, symbolized by opening ceremonies I
                    have attended ranging from one of the world's largest coal mines to the world's
                    largest Kentucky Fried Chicken. But major obstacles and frustrations remain for
                    American business. The current credit and liquidity crunch of domestic
                    retrenchment is having a significant adverse impact. Longer term problems
                    include Chinese practices, soft loans from our competitors, and residual
                    technology controls. We have gotten nowhere on a bilateral investment treaty. In
                    the past year we have moved intellectual property rights from almost footnote
                    status to the very top of our bilateral economic agenda. We have been
                    intensifying our education campaign. The Chinese remain serious violators; and
                    this issue could be among our most troublesome near-term problems in bilateral
                    relations. We have consulted thoroughly on China's GATT application, but its
                    trade reforms must be advanced in order to avoid a heavily safeguarded
                    admission. We need to reinvigorate the JCCT and JEC. On the former we have now
                    agreed with the Chinese to flesh out our proposal for working groups to effect
                    more concrete progress.</p>
                <p>11. Science and technology programs.</p>
                <p>Our thirty protocols constitute the largest bilateral program either country
                    conducts. We face the continuing challenges to improve the balance of mutual
                    benefits and the commercial applications. And we have correctly hinged the
                    five-year renewal of the umbrella accord on satisfactory Chinese assurances on
                    protection of intellectual property rights. After intensive negotiations we
                    reached a major agreement on satellite launches with the Chinese which will
                    marry Chinese rockets with American satellites on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                <p>12. Our military ties have been substantially enriched over the past three years,
                    not withstanding a temporary pause induced by the missile issue. Virtually every
                    top military leader on both sides has recently crossed the Pacific and a heavy
                    schedule of further trips will unfold during the remainder of this year.
                    Meanwhile working level delegations expand our professional links. One of the
                    most dramatic events of my tenure was the first visit ever to the People's
                    Republic by American naval ships in the autumn of 1986. A year later the U.S.
                    Air Force Thunderbirds performed over Beijing. Earlier this month I saw off the
                    first PRC warship ever to visit the West. More American vessels will steam into
                    Shanghai while Gorbachev is in China, perhaps in Shanghai itself. We have been
                    implementing $800 million worth of defensive weapons sales and are exploring
                    possible new items.</p>
                <p>13. We will need to continue measuring our tread in our military cooperation. It
                    projects useful symbolism and enlists constituencies in the PLA which could play
                    a key role in Beijing's future orientation. But as China grows stronger, so will
                    apprehensions among its Asian neighbors about its intentions and possibly our
                    involvement.</p>
                <p>14. Educational and cultural exchanges.</p>
                <pb facs="0561" n="Page0561"/>
                <p>These have mushroomed since 1985, due to one of the most fertile USIA programs
                    anywhere and the proper, expanding, indispensable role of the private sector.
                    American campuses welcome more than 35,000 Chinese students, over half of all
                    those abroad. Increasing numbers of American students and teachers are coming to
                    China, including 25 Fulbrighters at fifteen universities. The world's largest
                    international visitors program has sent almost 300 present and future Chinese
                    leaders to the U.S. VOA reaches and affects tens of millions of Chinese, from
                    ordinary citizens to the highest leaders. We have recently installed a TVRO and
                    are stepping-up direct trans-Pacific dialogue through WorldNet as well as
                    placing programs on Chinese television. President Bush was the first foreign
                    leader to address the Chinese people live on television. I was the first
                    American Ambassador to be interviewed on the Chinese screen (or, to introduce
                    the “Barbarian” Superbowl). Our book program has translated and published
                    fifty-nine titles on American life.</p>
                <p>15. Especially young Chinese are beginning to appreciate our culture as well as
                    our technology, thanks to a continual flow of American artists, performers,
                    troupes and exhibits. These range from Ailey to Joffrey, Peck to Heston, Disney
                    to the Redskins, “The Music Man” to the “Caine Mutiny Court Martial,” which is
                    having a remarkable impact here.</p>
                <p>16. We can never do enough in these areas. For our most profound challenges
                    include promoting mutual understanding and reaching the younger generations of
                    Chinese. Whenever I succumb to temporary pessimism about China's future, I need
                    only recall the warmth and enthusiasm in overflowing university auditoriums
                    greeting Mrs. Lord and me - or, more accurately, America.</p>
                <p>17. With occasional blips, cultural exchange has progressed despite the periodic
                    clampdown on intellectuals and expression in China. A potentially dicey area is
                    official nervousness about our access to campuses. If this translates into
                    significant obstacles I believe we should consider reciprocal actions against
                    Chinese diplomats in the U.S., while recognizing the dilemmas presented by our
                    free society.</p>
                <p>18. Three weeks ago I signed an exchange of letters which will pave the way for
                    the first Peace Corps volunteers ever to serve in a communist country. This is
                    the fruit of four years of strenuous effort. No fruit has tasted sweeter; few
                    programs hold more potential for Sino-American friendship over the long
                    term.</p>
                <p>19. Working and living conditions.</p>
                <pb facs="0562" n="Page0562"/>
                <p>Major improvements have lifted both morale and efficiency. Comprehensive
                    reciprocity talks yielded good results on housing and travel, though we are now
                    stalled on almost every front. The separation of negotiations on housing and
                    selective retaliation hopefully will enable us to resume a positive course
                    benefitting both sides. During the past three years we have built a snack bar,
                    swimming pool, and tennis court as well as additional office space. We have
                    moved the international school to spacious new quarters, allowing steady
                    expansion. We have vastly improved our security posture but are still highly
                    vulnerable on the technical side; we urgently need Washington funding to shore
                    up our defenses. We have managed the burgeoning bilateral relationship sketched
                    in this message with no net growth in our personnel ranks since 1985. Our future
                    substantive performance would be enhanced, and our budget greatly reduced, if we
                    required three year tours here of all but junior officers.</p>
                <p>Challenges.</p>
                <p>20. These areas illustratively document the basically sound and growing nature of
                    our bilateral relations. Much more than in the 1970s this relationship now
                    stands on its own, regardless of our changing ties to other nations. We have
                    multiplied the constituencies on both sides of the Pacific which have a stake in
                    positive bonds. When serious issues surfaced - such as missiles, expulsions, or
                    satellites - each side strove to insulate frictions from the core of our
                    relations, to maintain overall momentum even as specific initiatives might be
                    put on hold.</p>
                <p>21. While we can therefore take comfort on broad foundations, we can hardly be
                    complacent. Coming years will bring demanding tests we cannot now foresee: four
                    years ago I would have been amazed if told that Silkworms, Tibetans and
                    dissidents would cause more angst than Taiwan. Our most fundamental challenges,
                    however, are already taking shape. I outlined these in my late 1988 San
                    Francisco and New York speeches and in my farewell remarks these past few weeks.
                    Current headlines symbolize the three broad areas: Gorbachev is coming to town;
                    our traders and investors are being squeezed by retrenchment; and there is
                    palpable Chinese nervousness about domestic dissent.</p>
                <p>22. The political challenge.The international framework for our bilateral
                    relations is changing rapidly. The world of the 1970s has been radically
                    altered; so has the world of the mid-1980s. Washington will have a more
                    comprehensive view of this than those of us here. The underlying trends toward
                    multipolarity and interdependence accelerate. The decline of Marxism and
                    Stalinism, the spread of the market and democracy, are ever more apparent. The
                    age of technology and information has already arrived. Gorbachev seeks to
                    transform the Soviet Union, and Moscow's relations with the United States,
                    China, Eastern and Western Europe dramatically evolve. (Can Japan be far
                    behind?) China grows stronger and more assertive on the world stage.</p>
                <pb facs="0563" n="Page0563"/>
                <p>23. We have coped reasonably well with the impact of these changes on our
                    bilateral relations - whether concerning approaches toward Moscow, regional
                    conflicts, missiles, or satellites. We have every reason to be positive. We can
                    take in stride the coming media blitz over the Deng-Gorbachev summit. The
                    history and geography of Sino-Soviet relations will not change, nor will their
                    long border and overlapping ethnic populations. As the Chairman made amply clear
                    to the President, China will need the United States to balance the Soviet Union
                    - and Japan. China's overwhelming preoccupation with modernization must orient
                    it toward the West for capital, management, technology and trade.</p>
                <p>24. Our central task - for our China as for our global interests - is to act
                    responsibly and purposefully around the world. So long as we do, our relations
                    with Beijing should flourish. Early in the next century, when China can project
                    its power and our Asian friends consequently project their concerns, we may have
                    to review the bidding. But a stronger China is much more likely to be
                    responsible - and responsive to us - if we have fully engaged it on
                    international issues and participated in its development.</p>
                <p>25. The economic challenge.</p>
                <p>As our overall relationship with China matures, so must our economic ties. We
                    have come a very long way from our mutual illusions in the early years after the
                    opening. Our business people - eyeing China's size, population, natural
                    resources, inexpensive labor and needs - held exaggerated visions of the huge
                    China market. Many got burned. The Chinese, in turn, assumed that eager
                    outsiders would pour capital and technology into this country. They were
                    somewhat slow to recognize that they had to offer profits and compete with other
                    markets for foreign attention.</p>
                <p>26. Both sides have learned a great deal, often at the cost of considerable
                    frustration. Americans are more realistic about near-term gains and adept at
                    trading and investing in this opaque and bureaucratic environment. Despite
                    well-publicized setbacks, few have gone home. Most are playing for the long-run.
                    And many success stories unfold unnoticed behind the media glare on
                    problems.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the Chinese have substantially improved the investment climate, though
                    its quality varies greatly from one province or city or sector to another. As a
                    result our trade statistics have shot up dramatically the past few years. So
                    have the number of investment projects, though the value remains modest.</p>
                <pb facs="0564" n="Page0564"/>
                <p>27. We have only begun to tap the potential of our economic cooperation. The next
                    two or three years will bring a substantial slow-down overall, and some
                    backsliding in certain areas. The negative effects of the current retrenchment
                    are already being felt. The Chinese clampdown on foreign exchange, credit,
                    construction, and local autonomy will kill or delay many promising deals. One
                    can only hope this period of tightening will be brief and that momentum toward
                    reforms and the opening can be effectively regenerated. If China settles into
                    long-run stagflation or, worse, reverses field back toward central planning and
                    protectionism, then our commercial ties will be seriously affected. So in turn
                    might the stability of China and its overall relationship with the West. I do
                    not believe this will happen, but prudence suggests that it could.28. Assuming
                    we move through and beyond the retrenchment phase (as we have before), we will
                    still face the more fundamental challenge of reconciling our two very different
                    systems. The mutual imperative will be to loosen up and open up. The United
                    States should increasingly “normalize” its economic relations with China as we
                    have done on the political front. (See the recent Nicholas Lardy report
                    published by the National Committee on U.S.-China relations). This requires
                    further relaxation of strategic controls on technology, consistent with national
                    security. Our anti-dumping approach toward China calls for revision.
                    Protectionism in general needs to be resisted. And other steps, like
                    unconditional MFN and GSP, should be considered in tandem with China's
                    willingness to free up its own system.</p>
                <p>29. If we are to consider such movement on our part, the Chinese must take
                    reciprocal actions. As China becomes more fully engaged in the world economy, it
                    must assume a more open stance. If it wants to gain admission to the GATT, it
                    must liberalize its trading regime. If it wants more technology, it must protect
                    intellectual property rights. If it wants more investment, it must make it
                    profitable. This imposing agenda will demand much of both sides, officials and
                    entrepreneurs alike, during the coming years. The stakes, for our political ties
                    as well as our commercial benefits, are very high.</p>
                <p>30. The cultural challenge.</p>
                <p>The newest, and perhaps most prickly, problem in our relationship flows from the
                    intermingling of our societies and values. As with our other challenges, the
                    stage has been set by success. The explosion in educational and cultural
                    exchanges, most of it in the private sector, is a major positive force. It
                    enriches both our countries and greatly expands personal networks that will
                    buttress our overall relationship in the future. But Chinese officials resist
                    the intrusion of certain ideas. China has always been particularly wary of
                    foreign cultural contamination, whether because of middle kingdom arrogance or
                    its century long humiliation by foreigners.31. Several factors have now joined
                    to make the issue of human rights especially sensitive:</p>
                <pb facs="0565" n="Page0565"/>
                <p>The serious economic and corruption problems that have surfaced since last summer
                    have created disaffection among the people and malaise among the leaders. The
                    latter currently place their premium on stability (as Deng and Zhao told the
                    President). They see the free expression of ideas as leading to instability
                    rather than helping them find answers to complex questions.</p>
                <p>Dissident activity, traditionally restrained in China, is picking up,including
                    the signing of petitions for amnesty for political prisoners.</p>
                <p>As Deng fades from the scene, the jockeying for succession haintensified, adding
                    to political tensions.</p>
                <p>Thanks to Gorbachev's “Glasnost” political and cultural reforms in the Soviet
                    Union have outpaced those in China. Chinese intellectuals and artists have been
                    unfavorably comparing their lot with that of their Russian and Eastern European
                    colleagues. Political developments in Hungary and Poland also have caught their
                    attention. Meanwhile, Chinese leaders look with apprehension at the unrest in
                    the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe caused by political reforms.</p>
                <p>We have made human rights a prominent part of our agenda with the Soviet Union
                    and achieved some success. The American domestic audience has increasingly
                    questioned the disparity with China. The question I have been most frequently
                    asked in recent public appearances and backgrounders is why we practice a
                    “double standard.”</p>

                <p>32. Against this backdrop the Chinese are currently defining “stability” in very
                    narrow terms, i.e., the suppression of dissent. So far the smothering of
                    expression has been confined to the political arena and has not appreciably
                    affected cultural life, but it would not be surprising to see it spread there as
                    it has in past campaigns. During the past decade Beijing has generally affirmed
                    that intellectual ferment and creativity was needed to help China find the
                    answers in its perplexing quest for modernization. Political reform was needed
                    alongside economic reform. “Let a hundred flowers bloom.” These themes are
                    largely absent today. To be sure, Chinese policies, even when misguided, on the
                    whole show relative improvement. Dissidents are ostracized, or (sometimes)
                    allowed to leave the country, rather than locked up. Continued employment may be
                    allowed even as Party membership is lost. But steam is building up in
                    intellectual circles. Official nationwide campaigns are increasingly difficult
                    to mount because the people won't support them. The Party's image continues to
                    deteriorate. Cynicism is rampant.There is a feeling that the CCP has lost its
                    ideological bearings and flounders in uncharted waters.</p>
                <p>33. It is arrogant for the outsider to judge how best China can balance progress
                    and stability, how fast it can move toward a freer society. But we can hope that
                    China will soon resume again the generally positive course it has pursued since
                    reforms began; that Chinese authorities will make distinctions, for example,
                    between free expression and instant multi-party democracy; that “stability” will
                    be given a more sophisticated definition. For the long run I am hopeful, as
                    younger generations - exposed to Western ideas - seize the reins.34. For our
                    part we will need to strike a balance in our human rights policy toward China,
                    as we do elsewhere. We should project our values, maintain contact with
                    activists, and register our disapproval concerning abuses. But we must also
                    weigh our strategic, political, economic and other interests. We must employ
                    approaches - sometimes public, sometimes symbolic, often private - which can
                    have a positive impact on China's future course, not just make us feel good.</p>
                <p>35. We should maintain an appreciation of the awesome challenges China faces as
                    it seeks to move from one century to another, from one system to another, in a
                    few short decades. We need to have some sense of what is feasible, either in
                    terms of pace or cultural context. We should use carrots as well as sticks,
                    welcoming positive moves and helping the Chinese to develop a legal framework
                    for human rights. We should keep an eye on overall trends, not merely take
                    snapshots.</p>
                <p>36. We can hope, but should not expect, other democracies to make human rights a
                    multilateral issue, not just a Sino-American bilateral one. The recent European
                    posture on Tibet has been helpful, but our allies in Europe and Asia will
                    generally let us take the lead - and take the heat. The Soviet Union will try to
                    exploit this issue to its advantage. Some Chinese leaders will be prone to
                    contrast Soviet restraint with American meddling.</p>

                <p>37. The Feng Lizhi banquet incident was an unfortunate but minor blemish which
                    did no damage to the relationship. But it was a harbinger of serious tensions to
                    come in the human rights arena. As time passes from the wisdom of our symbolic
                    gesture will be increasingly clear. The Chinese were entirely to blame for their
                    needless escalation. They are geniuses at making foreigners feel guilty and
                    dividing them. One very important lesson to be learned from this episode is not
                    to let them succeed.</p>
                <p>Conclusion</p>
                <p>38. I am delighted with President Bush's appointment of Jim Lilley as my
                    successor. His broad experience, outstanding career, and closeness to the
                    President make him a superb choice to strengthen our relations with China. I
                    will do all that I can to help him.</p>
                <p>39. I conclude with expressions of gratitude to the following:</p>
                <p>President Regan for having appointed me.</p>
                <p>Those in Washington who have supported me and our mission in China.</p>
                <p>The members of this embassy and our consulates during my three and one half year
                    tenure for their talents and their tenacity in the pursuit of excellence.
                    Overall they have formed the best overseas team I have seen in decades of
                    service.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] Well, let's turn now to the time that you were
                        AssistanSecretary of State...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Let me say that Nancy Bernkopf is welcome to stay. Nancy, yowon't hurt my
                    feelings if you leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Bernkopf] I will stay until noon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] In the first place, could you explain what you had been doing and
                    how you were tapped for this job of Assistant Secretary of State? It was under a
                    completely different administration and so forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0568" n="Page0568"/>
                <p>LORD: I put together some notes on this and some dates. I left China as
                    Ambassador on April 22, 1989. It was one week after the Tiananmen demonstrations
                    began. It was the date of the funeral of Hu Yaobang. There was a major turnout
                    for the funeral, which perhaps 100,000 people attended.</p>
                <p>On my way back to the United States I stopped off in Singapore and had a small
                    dinner with Lee Kuan Yew. I brilliantly predicted that the demonstrations in
                    China, although very important, were manageable by Beijing, as far as I could
                    tell. Even then I was not aware of the magnitude of what was coming.</p>
                <p>I got back to the U.S. and spent a lot of time on television and witthe radio and
                    print media. Did we cover this?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] I'm not sure, but go ahead.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I spent a lot of time with the media, commenting on unfolding events in
                    Tiananmen Square, even as my wife had circled back to China as a commentator for
                    CBS Television. This is probably repetitious. I'd better get it straight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] You talked about her role.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: She was recruited for commentary on Gorbachev's visit to China by Don
                    Hewitt of “60 Minutes.” I'm pretty sure that we've been through all of that.
                    Then we went out to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for three months. During this period
                    my wife wrote a book called “Legacies,” which was another best seller, I might
                    add, and chosen by Time magazine as one of the 10 outstanding books of the year.
                    It covered true stories of her family and Chinese of all walks of life, set
                    against the backdrop of Tiananmen Square.</p>
                <p>I wrote a long article for “Foreign Affairs” on China policy, looking to the
                    period “Beyond the Big Chill” and the impact of the Tiananmen Square events. In
                    effect, I was very tough on the Chinese regarding the Tiananmen Square incident
                    and on human rights in general. I also made a strong pitch that we had to stay
                    engaged with China and get through this period. That article was published in
                    the fall of 1989.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] I wonder if you could explain how you perceived the role of articles
                    in “Foreign Affairs” magazine at this particular time, because this is
                    important. How were articles like this used within the foreign affairs
                    establishment?</p>
                <pb facs="0569" n="Page0569"/>
                <p>LORD: Keep in mind that I had been the President of the Council on Foreign
                    Relations, which publishes “Foreign Affairs,” although the magazine itself is
                    independent of the Council. In fact, to demonstrate that, William P. Bundy, who
                    was the editor of “Foreign Affairs” during most of the time that I was President
                    of the Council, once rejected an article by David Rockefeller, who was then
                    Chairman of the Council's Board of Directors. That demonstrated the real
                    independence of the magazine. To Rockefeller's credit, he never took it out on
                    Bill Bundy. In fact, he admired him for his courage, if not his judgment.</p>
                <p>So I think that it's fair to say that, although sometimes people leave copies of
                    “Foreign Affairs” on their coffee tables - the magazine was not as sprightly as
                    it is today - nevertheless, it is among the elite publications reviewed by
                    members of the think tanks, Congress, administration, and media. It is purely
                    concerned about foreign policy and probably has about as much influence as any
                    one magazine can have. It published the famous “Mr X” article on containment [in
                    1947] by George Kennan. It has published many other distinguished articles.</p>
                <p>So I felt that my article and its placement were important in terms of the debate
                    on U.S.-China policy in the wake of Tiananmen Square. Given my credentials and
                    long involvement with China and having just been U.S. Ambassador to China, I
                    felt that this was an appropriate time to set forth my views on the current
                    situation in China.</p>
                <p>The article had two elements to it. I was much tougher than the Bush
                    administration on Deng Xiaoping and what the Chinese were up to. Then, having
                    established my credibility on that front and saying that human rights are still
                    very important, I then went on to say that we have great stakes in a better
                    relationship with China. I said that we have to get beyond the big chill in our
                    relations with China. I laid out the reasons for the broad agenda we have with
                    China as we look to the future. I needed the space that a long article like that
                    could give me. I had time to think about this subject when we were out in
                    Jackson Hole, Wyoming, so I put a lot of care into the article.</p>
                <p>I checked the article out with Dick Solomon, a predecessor as Assistant Secretary
                    of State for East Asian Affairs, and the administration, without giving him or
                    them any veto on its content. I didn't expect him to make any changes but I
                    wanted to make sure that I didn't have anything inaccurate in the article. I
                    welcomed his views, as an old colleague, going back to the Kissinger days and in
                    recognition of his qualifications as a scholar on China. As I recall, Dick
                    Solomon had some helpful suggestions to make on the article, although they were
                    not really of major significance. He was not uncomfortable about the article. It
                    had not been my purpose as to whether he was uncomfortable with it. I wanted to
                    be sure that I had not left anything out of it or made any inaccuracies. I also
                    believe in the principle of not blindsiding colleagues, especially old friends
                    and coworkers.</p>
                <p>I can't judge how much impact the “Foreign Affairs” article had.However, I felt
                    that it was important to express my views.</p>
                <pb facs="0570" n="Page0570"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] Do you think that this article was picked up by
                        peoplwho eventually were going to form the Clinton administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No. This article appeared in the fall of 1989, about three and one-half
                    years away from the entry into office of the Clinton administration. The article
                    was very strong on human rights in China. I note that in succeeding years there
                    were increasing charges that President Bush was too soft on China or that China
                    was too nasty in the field of human rights. The article also had a lot of
                    emphasis on maintaining our engagement with China. I have no way of knowing
                    whether the article had any influence on those who read it. Probably, Warren
                    Christopher read the article. He was to be Secretary of State during the first
                    Clinton term as President. He had been a member of the Board of the Council on
                    Foreign Relations. Probably Tony Lake (to be NSC Advisor) and others in the
                    Clinton administration read it, too. We can come back to this matter later.</p>
                <p>During this period I wrote some Op Ed pieces [articles which appear on the page
                    opposite the editorials in some newspapers]. I kept in touch with the media as a
                    commentator on China in particular. I testified before Congress on occasion,
                    essentially on China. I was deposed and testified at some length on the POW/MIA
                    [Prisoner of War/Missing in Action] issue in Vietnam. I believe that I testified
                    on this matter in the summer or fall of 1992. I gave lengthy testimony on the
                    Vietnam Peace Agreement [of 1973], with emphasis on the POW/MIA issue, before
                    Senator John Kerry, Senator Smith, and others. As I said, I gave speeches,
                    either for money or pro bono. I joined the Board and became Vice Chairman of the
                    International Rescue Committee [IRC], the largest, non sectarian organization
                    which both helps refugees abroad and resettles them in the U.S. A few years
                    later, I became co-chairman of the IRC. I became a member of the Board and then
                    Chairman of the National Endowment for Democracy, which promotes freedom and
                    democracy around the world. I was an active member of the Council on Foreign
                    Relations and also worked on projects in other think tanks. I was a member of
                    other groups, like the Trilateral Commission, and on the Board of Advisors for
                    the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. I have cited other affiliations
                    elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Then, for about a year or a year and a half I worked for and with Ambassador
                    Morton Abramowitz, who was then President of the Carnegie Endowment, on a major,
                    national commission on U.S. foreign policy, in the wake of momentous events,
                    including the move toward freedom in the world, globalization, and all of the
                    other elements that you are familiar with. I was Chairman of this Carnegie
                    Endowment's National Commission on America and the World, which put out a report
                    on foreign policy in 1992, looking to the time when the next administration
                    would enter office. This job took up a great deal of my time. This Commission
                    was a very distinguished group. We can go into more detail on it at some other
                    point, if you like. So I kept up my interests, my work, and certainly my
                    visibility on foreign policy, including on China.</p>
                <pb facs="0571" n="Page0571"/>
                <p>Then, when Clinton was elected President, I think that the followinconsiderations
                    led to my appointment as Assistant Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] This was the election of 1992.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's correct. First, I already had a bipartisan reputation. I happened to
                    be a liberal Republican, which is an oxymoron these days. I had worked under
                    several presidents of both parties as a career Foreign Service Officer, as a
                    civil servant, as a Schedule C, and then as a political appointee Ambassador
                    under President Reagan. I had always taken a centrist and bipartisan approach in
                    my politics and foreign policy issues. Without being pompous about it, I
                    considered that we do need some competency and professionalism in foreign policy
                    from administration to administration. One should serve any President as long as
                    that President has a reasonable approach in foreign policy. Some of my heroes,
                    as I've said before, were people like John McCloy, David Bruce, and Ellsworth
                    Bunker, who had done this at more exalted levels. So that was my instinct, and I
                    think that my reputation has been that of someone who is bipartisan and not
                    ideological.</p>
                <p>Probably the least important reason that I was tapped as Assistant Secretary was
                    that I was the one Republican under consideration for a post requiring
                    confirmation by the Senate. I don't think that that was, by any means, a major
                    reason. I think that that was very marginal and very modest. However, along with
                    David Gergen and Dick Morris, I think that I was about the only Republican with
                    any interest in serving in the Clinton administration.</p>
                <p>More importantly, I had gotten to know Warren Christopher, who was appointed
                    Secretary of State and headed the transition team on personnel appointments in
                    the first Clinton administration. Christopher was a member of the Board of the
                    Council on Foreign Relations and Vice Chairman when I was President. We worked
                    together when we set up programs on the West Coast, in addition to those in New
                    York and Washington. Once, when I came back from China, just before the
                    elections of 1988, I spoke to the Council on Foreign Relations in California.
                    Christopher chaired that meeting. We renewed our acquaintanceship, and he said
                    that he was impressed with my speech and presentation on that occasion. So we
                    had kept in touch.</p>
                <p>Peter Tarnoff was my successor at the Council on Foreign Relations. He was also
                    very close to Christopher, who knew him very favorably and well. He was
                    ultimately tapped to be Under Secretary for Political Affairs in the State
                    Department. I knew a great many of the other people going into the Clinton
                    administration. So, to the extent that they would check me out with the White
                    House, Tony Lake would know me best from his time on Kissinger's staff, where I
                    also had served. There were, of course, my general credentials in foreign
                    policy, including as Kissinger's Special Assistant, Director of the State
                    Department Policy Planning Staff, President of the Council on Foreign Relations,
                    and Ambassador to China.</p>
                <pb facs="0572" n="Page0572"/>
                <p>Finally, of course, as we mentioned before, I had met with Clinton in New Haven,
                    Connecticut, on or about Labor Day, 1992. We talked about Japan and China. That
                    conversation went well. Strobe Talbot gave my name, along with Tony Lake, to
                    Clinton. Talbot was obviously very close to Clinton. So, given my career
                    history, my bipartisan credentials, and my personal contacts, I think that all
                    of this led to the prediction by Peter Tarnoff that I would receive an
                    appointment in the incoming, Clinton administration. Tarnoff had already been
                    chosen as Under Secretary for Political Affairs during the Christmas holiday
                    season, after the election in November, 1992.</p>
                <p>Then fairly close to the inauguration of President Clinton on January 20, 1993, I
                    received a phone call from Christopher, in which he invited me to serve in the
                    new administration. Of course, I accepted, after first talking the idea over
                    with my wife, as I always do on major decisions.</p>
                <p>Q: We will come back to other matters. However, if you could, would you mention
                    your own position? If you were not a rock ribbed Republican, you were in the
                    Republican camp for a long time. How did your meeting with President Clinton
                    come about, and so forth?</p>
                <p>LORD: I started out as a career Foreign Service Officer, then transferred to the
                    Civil Service and worked in the Department of Defense. Then, while still in the
                    Civil Service, I was assigned to \the staff of the NSC [National Security
                    Council] in the White House. Subsequently, I was a Schedule C officer in the
                    Department of State. I then left government service and was appointed Ambassador
                    to the People's Republic of China by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican. I
                    left government service again. However, I've always been bipartisan. I've been a
                    centrist in ideological terms on most matters. I'm what you might call a liberal
                    Republican, which is almost an oxymoron these days.</p>
                <p>I've always felt that you should serve Presidents and administrations, assuming
                    that they're responsible on foreign policy, and there is considerable continuity
                    in American foreign policy. Although you should not be extreme, you should serve
                    any President and try to contribute some continuity and professionalism, in
                    addition to what the Foreign Service could give. As I've said, I was once in the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>Some of my heroes have been those who have done this. I wouldn't put myself in
                    their league, of course. However, whether it was John McCloy, David Bruce,
                    Ellsworth Bunker, or people like that, I felt that I would like to serve in that
                    way. I've gone in and out of government to recharge my batteries, see more of my
                    family, get my tennis game in shape, pursue other interests, get away from the
                    strains and pressures, think and read, and get in better physical shape. So this
                    has been the pattern I have followed.</p>
                <pb facs="0573" n="Page0573"/>
                <p>To answer your question, I don't recall who it was from, specifically, but I got
                    a phone call from someone speaking on behalf of Tony Lake. It might have been
                    Tony Lake himself. This was some time in the course of July or August, 1992. I
                    was asked if I would meet with Governor Clinton, who was the Democratic
                    candidate for President. Lake and I had worked on the NSC [National Security
                    Council] staff under Kissinger. We hadn't really stayed in close touch, but
                    there was some mutual respect. Lake was in charge of foreign policy issues in
                    the Clinton campaign, with Sandy Berger as his deputy. Lake had the job of
                    enlisting outside experts to meet with Governor Clinton, prepare briefing
                    papers, questions and answers, policy positions, speeches, and so on.</p>
                <p>Clinton wanted to be briefed on Japan and China, so Lake assembled a group of
                    people which included not only himself but myself, Dick Holbrooke, and two other
                    people who were more expert on Japan. So we met with Clinton in New Haven,
                    Connecticut, either on Labor Day, 1992, or the day after that. In any case, it
                    was early September in New Haven.</p>
                <p>I walked into the room where the briefing was to be held. The first thing that
                    Clinton said to me was: “Strobe Talbott is very high on you.” It occurred to me
                    that not only had Tony Lake brought me to the attention of then Governor Clinton
                    but also Strobe Talbott. I had known Talbott ever since he covered the White
                    House as a reporter. We had kept in touch, and I had great respect for him. It
                    was obviously mutual. I didn't realize at the time how close Talbott was to
                    Governor Clinton. In addition to Clinton, one other person at this meeting in
                    New Haven was a man named Shearer, who was close to the President. Also Mike
                    Mochizuki, a Japan expert.</p>
                <p>So we sat down and discussed both Japan and China. I'll get back to the substance
                    of the discussion. Then during the next couple of months, during the
                    Presidential election campaign, I received calls on a couple of occasions from
                    Nancy Soderberg, who ended up as the number three official at the NSC and is now
                    at the UN. Nancy asked for my advice specifically on China policy, including the
                    MFN [Most Favored Nation] issue. So there was this background during the 1992
                    Presidential election campaign.</p>
                <p>Then, after the 1992 election, Warren Christopher was chosen to be Secretary of
                    State. As I understand it, he was asked to take Cliff Wharton as his deputy. I
                    think that Christopher was thinking of Tom Pickering or Peter Tarnoff for this
                    position. I also knew Wharton from the Council on Foreign Relations and
                    Christopher from the Council on Foreign Relations as well. He had been on the
                    Board of Directors of the Council. The number three person in State was Peter
                    Tarnoff, my successor as President of the Council on Foreign Relations. Tarnoff
                    was very close to Christopher. I didn't really know Sandy Berger but I knew Tony
                    Lake from the White House staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0574" n="Page0574"/>
                <p>So in addition to the combination of all of this, I suppose I had made a
                    favorable impression on Clinton. He did not get involved in making choices of
                    Assistant Secretaries of State. He left this pretty much up to Christopher, the
                    Secretary of State-designate. There may also have been a feeling that it
                    wouldn't hurt to have at least some relatively high level Republican in the
                    administration. However, and above all, there was the fact of my past service on
                    Asian affairs generally and on China specifically. So that is how I got involved
                    in the Clinton campaign and then in the Clinton administration.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] Yes. Can you give us a feel for what you saw of the foreign policy
                    apparatus when you came into the Clinton administration? First, could you talk
                    about your confirmation by the Senate? Then, could you discuss your initial
                    impressions of the new administration? One has the impression that there is some
                    feeling of reserve about him, as with a lot of new administrations, particularly
                    of a President who comes from Arkansas. The same thing was true with Ronald
                    Reagan. Every new administration goes through this kind of experience. That is,
                    it tends not to be overly interested or competent in the field of foreign
                    affairs. I'm talking about the political figures in the incoming
                    administration.</p>
                <p>LORD: First, it was clear from the Clinton campaign, and this was correct, in my
                    view, that he was going to focus above all, at least early in the
                    administration, on domestic policy. Probably the major reason that he defeated
                    President Bush in the election was that he demonstrated or presented the view
                    that Bush was so wrapped up in foreign policy that he didn't pay enough
                    attention to domestic issues. Speaking objectively, President Bush was more
                    interested in foreign policy than in domestic issues. So, out of conviction,
                    instinct, and his own experience as Governor of Arkansas, where he spent much
                    more time on domestic than foreign policy issues, it was clear that President
                    Clinton was going to pay his attention first to domestic issues.</p>
                <p>I thought that that concentration of attention and effort was important for the
                    country, but also considered that it was important for our foreign policy for us
                    to put our domestic act together in order to be effective on the world scene.
                    Now, I thought that immediately addressing some foreign policy matters was also
                    a crucial consideration.</p>
                <p>I didn't know Warren Christopher intimately. From the comments of others who had
                    worked with him and what I observed, I thought that he would be a competent
                    Secretary of State. I knew that he wouldn't have the flash and excitement of
                    Henry Kissinger, but he wouldn't have some of the down side of Kissinger,
                    either, in terms of his operating style.</p>
                <pb facs="0575" n="Page0575"/>
                <p>I'm trying to recall now how many of the other major figures I knew who were
                    being appointed to the new administration. I knew slightly Cliff Wharton from
                    the Council on Foreign Relations. I also knew, as I said, Peter Tarnoff, the
                    incoming Under Secretary for Political Affairs in the State Department, and Tony
                    Lake. I knew Strobe Talbot, who was being tapped on Russian policy. I had known
                    him favorably and well as a journalist and was a pretty good friend of his. So I
                    was convinced, from what I knew of the people being assembled and from what
                    Clinton had said, that I would be comfortable with the general thrust of the
                    foreign policy of the new administration.</p>
                <p>I'll get back to this in more depth, but I thought that it was important that we
                    elevate the position of Asia on our agenda. I don't recall that I focused on
                    this at the time, but the fact that Secretary Christopher came from California
                    and had spent most of his career on the West Coast meant that, in my view, he
                    would probably have some sense of the importance of the Pacific area.</p>
                <p>You could say, on a very petty level, that as I was becoming an Assistant
                    Secretary of State and had been Director of Policy Planning in the Department of
                    State a couple of decades before that, I was essentially coming back to the
                    Department at about the same level. That's a silly way to look at things. First
                    of all, in protocol terms, an Assistant Secretary of State has to be confirmed
                    by the Senate, whereas the position of Director of Policy Planning does not
                    require such confirmation. Much more essentially you serve your country. If
                    Governor Averell Harriman could go from being Governor of New York to being
                    Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, I figured that I could
                    do that.</p>
                <p>Of course, I would not have minded being tabbed as Number Two or Three in the
                    Department, as opposed to being an Assistant Secretary. However, I knew enough
                    to realize, from my long experience in the Department, that the Assistant
                    Secretary position is the real engine of the Department. That is where the
                    policy level and the global perspective meet with more detailed, specific,
                    regional concerns. The Assistant Secretary is the nexus for such concerns. I
                    don't want to be self-serving, but it's my observation that this position, in
                    many ways, is the most demanding job in the Department, short of the position of
                    Secretary of State itself. You have to know enough detail to run your own
                    bureau, overseas posts, and Embassies to testify before Congress, to talk to the
                    press, etc. You can't get away with being just generally familiar with the
                    various problems, as the Secretary or Under Secretary does. You have to be on
                    top of the details, but you also have to have the perspective of the Seventh
                    Floor in the State Department [where the Secretary and other senior officers
                    have their offices] and put together our strategy and global approach with
                    regional strategies.</p>
                <pb facs="0576" n="Page0576"/>
                <p>In terms of the demands that I would be faced with, I knew that the position of
                    Assistant Secretary was going to be very important, exciting, and challenging. I
                    will say right here, before I go any further, that this was the toughest job
                    that I ever had, in terms of how far I had to stretch and the demands placed on
                    me. It's as different as apples and oranges from being Special Assistant to
                    Henry Kissinger, which was a pretty demanding and tough job, too. However, I
                    would say that the position of Assistant Secretary was even tougher than the job
                    of Special Assistant to Kissinger. Being Ambassador was my most pleasant job.
                    The times with Kissinger were the most dramatic.</p>
                <p>Q: [Bernkopf] Is that because the position of Assistant Secretary is more
                    independent than what you had as a Special Assistant to Secretary Kissinger?</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, Kissinger was tough in another way. It was tough in physical terms,
                    but, then, I was a lot younger when I was Special Assistant to Kissinger. So I
                    was able to handle that. Being Special Assistant to Kissinger was tough in terms
                    of travel and the hours I had to work. It was also tough because of Kissinger's
                    personality. It was also exhilarating because of the excitement of working for
                    someone like Kissinger, who was so brilliant, as well as the attraction of being
                    involved in dramatic events. I'm not going to say that being Special Assistant
                    to Kissinger wasn't a tough and demanding job. However, my focus was much
                    narrower. I was dealing with China, Vietnam, to a certain extent Russia, and I
                    was writing and drafting material of very great importance - whether
                    communiques, peace agreements, or presidential statements. I was focused on
                    those countries and was essentially reporting to one person. As Assistant
                    Secretary, I was the nexus between the Secretary of State and the Seventh Floor
                    and my Bureau and/or the Embassies in the East Asian area. Not to mention the
                    White House, the Defense Department, the economic agencies of the government,
                    the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], and other institutions, non-governmental
                    organizations, business, the media, etc.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed the job of Ambassador to China the most, but working for Secretary
                    Kissinger was more dramatic. The most enjoyable job was being an Ambassador. A
                    more difficult job was being Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and
                    Pacific Affairs. The good thing about being an Ambassador is that you
                    essentially are running your own show. You have to take instructions from the
                    State Department in Washington, but you're in charge of your own team. It's much
                    less bureaucratic in terms of infighting and jungle warfare than you inevitably
                    have in Washington. That doesn't mean that you don't have your own share of such
                    bureaucratic warfare, and you have personnel problems in an Embassy. However, at
                    least you feel that you are running your own ship, whereas in Washington you are
                    involved in constant, bureaucratic battles. On the other hand, you have much
                    more power in Washington, more influence on policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0577" n="Page0577"/>
                <p>So the Assistant Secretary not only has to run his or her own bureau. You have to
                    deal with and instruct 20 or 25 Ambassadors. You constantly have to deal with
                    Congress and the press. You have to work the inter-agency circuit. You have to
                    deal with other bureaus in the Department, in competition with officials on the
                    Seventh Floor. You have to deal with think tanks and interest groups, all of
                    which makes it fascinating and demanding but which stretched me even further.
                    I'll get into all of that later on. I don't recall what this question involved,
                    but these were all reasons for my mood as I took over the position of Assistant
                    Secretary and my approach to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] What about the process of confirmation by the
                        Senate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That was an important experience. After getting this phone call from
                    Secretary Christopher, I went down to Washington. My wife took only one day to
                    find a terrific place to live. By the way, I don't know whether it is important
                    to record this, but she found this house in one day. The next day she went to
                    Woodward &amp; Lothrop [Washington department store] to buy furnishings for the
                    house. They already were having a Christmas sale. She asked them if they would
                    give her another 20% reduction if she furnished her whole house that afternoon.
                    They gave her some incredible deals, and she had the place furnished in two
                    days. We moved into the house a week later. That may be of no interest to
                    anybody except me.</p>
                <p>The point is that I went down to Washington and I stayed in a hotel for two
                    months before we began looking for a house, and while I was awaiting my
                    hearings..</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] This shows an attitude of mind. Regarding your confirmation by the
                    Senate, did you anticipate that this would be a problem?</p>
                <p>LORD: No, I didn't think that it would be a problem at all and I'll get to that.
                    I went to the hotel and began working very well with Bill Clark, who was my
                    predecessor. He even invited me to sit in on staff meetings. My security
                    clearance and all of the related, paper work had to be taken care of. I began to
                    talk to many of the people in the Bureau. I began to think about staffing the
                    Bureau with people whom I would need. I'll come back to that later, because the
                    personnel you get is a very important consideration. Meanwhile, I was studying
                    the Asian area, reading up about it, and beginning to think about my
                    confirmation by the Senate.</p>
                <pb facs="0578" n="Page0578"/>
                <p>My hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee finally took place in
                    March, 1993, which was fairly rapid, by today's standards. The confirmation
                    statement I presented was really quite important. I have a copy of it right
                    here. I was determined to give a very thoughtful confirmation statement. Usually
                    - and this is not a value judgment, this is more a matter of prudence -
                    confirmation statements are usually pretty cut and dried. You start off by
                    saying that it is an honor to be chosen by the President for this position. You
                    say that you will do your best to work with Congress. Then you take some
                    boilerplate language out of some handy questions and answers that you have to
                    briefly review the situation in the region. You say that we have great interests
                    in the area and that you will promote them, or something on that relatively
                    limited level of sophistication.</p>
                <p>I was determined to take a chance because I thought that it was very important,
                    right at the beginning, to try to elevate Asia. I wanted to set out a conceptual
                    framework for my approach to foreign policy, a device which I had learned from
                    Kissinger. I thought that I wanted to make this statement eloquent and I had the
                    time to work on it. I'm a good drafter. I thought that I would get officials in
                    foreign Embassies to look at the statement and the attention of the Senate,
                    which was confirming me in this position. I was going to mail copies of it
                    widely to think tanks, journalists, and others.</p>
                <p>With this statement I sought to commit the Administration in certain directions.
                    I was taking a certain chance in this respect. I obviously didn't do anything
                    that was radical. I was pushing the envelope, to some extent, and I'll get into
                    this in a minute. My aim was precisely to get off to a fast start and to get the
                    Asia-Pacific agenda lifted up in the field of American foreign policy. Through
                    most of our history we have been Eurocentric for legitimate reasons. Most of our
                    immigrants came from Europe until the last 20 or 30 years, and we have a heavily
                    European-oriented population. Until the past 20 years or so most of our trade
                    was across the Atlantic Ocean. We've been involved in wars in Europe, as well as
                    in Asia, of course. So it was somewhat natural that we focused on Europe.</p>
                <p>However, for a variety of reasons which I set forth in my statement, I felt that
                    it was important to equate Asia with Europe in terms of our interests. We didn't
                    have to say that Asia was more important than Europe. I used the formulation
                    that no region is more important to the U.S. than Asia.</p>
                <pb facs="0579" n="Page0579"/>
                <p>So for all of these reasons I was determined to present a thoughtful and
                    comprehensive statement. As I drafted this statement, and we got closer to the
                    date for my hearing, I ran into a buzz saw from the Bureau of Congressional
                    Relations. Wendy Sherman [Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations], whom
                    I respected then and still do, is a very able person. However, she and her
                    staff, from what I understood, felt that I should not be making such a
                    substantive statement. This might open me up to questions from some of the
                    Senators, and I might get into trouble. There was also the feeling that I was
                    out there making policy. To an extent, of course, I was guilty of the latter.I
                    felt very strongly about this. For all of my cited reasons I wanted to make a
                    statement of substance. I had worked hard on it and I thought that it was a very
                    good statement. I was determined not to take “No” for an answer. So I had to go
                    over to talk to Peter Tarnoff in the first instance. I made it very clear that
                    if he didn't support me, I was going to go to Secretary Christopher. I felt very
                    strongly about this. I was fairly sure that I would prevail. However, you don't
                    go around threatening or hinting to resign shortly after you are appointed. You
                    shouldn't do that lightly. I don't know whether I would have resigned in this
                    case or not. I never got to that point but I was prepared to engage in an all
                    out battle, even if I had to go to the White House, because I felt that it was
                    that important. Frankly, this approach paid off, and I'll go into the substance
                    of this matter in a minute.</p>
                <p>As I said, this approach paid off. I have to be careful not to appear to be
                    self-serving, but it was a hell of a good statement. It's the best statement
                    that I've ever seen presented at a confirmation hearing before the Senate. I can
                    say that without wishing to appear egotistical. The statement attracted
                    considerable attention in Asia and a lot of commentaries in this country. There
                    were a lot of favorable comments when I mailed copies of it to a lot of people.
                    It set out new themes which, I think, we applied over the four years I was
                    Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] I'd like to ask you about the themes in your statement. However,
                    first, you didn't mention the White House. Tell me the reaction in particular
                    from Tony Lake, the incoming National Security Adviser. When you were preparing
                    this statement for the senate, I thought that you would have to protect your
                    flank by checking the statement out with Tony Lake.</p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. Of course, I cleared the statement around the government, including
                    the NSC. The problem came from H [Bureau of Congressional Relations], not on the
                    substance, but on the general principle that you don't make substantive comments
                    when you go before the Senate for confirmation. That probably makes sense,
                    because you can get into trouble when you appear to be pressing the envelope. I
                    felt that I wasn't really pressing the envelope, because I had cleared the
                    statement all around the administration. So I thought that I was on safe ground
                    in that respect. The fact is that I was projecting policies. It was mostly a
                    matter of the conceptual approach, as opposed to breaking new ground in specific
                    policy terms. However, there were some cases where I was probably pushing the
                    envelope. I know that I cleared the statement generally.</p>
                <pb facs="0580" n="Page0580"/>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] What were the salient points of your statement, particularly the
                    ones which would have involved moving ahead, rather than the usual contents.</p>
                <p>LORD: I don't want to go into it at great length, because it's probably more than
                    you want to know. What I did was the following. First, the title of the
                    statement was “A New Pacific Community: Ten Goals for American Policy.” When I
                    referred to it over the next few years, I called it, “Lord's Ten Commandments.”
                    This may not have been the first use of the term, “Pacific Community,” but it
                    was the first use by an official of the Clinton Administration. I don't know
                    whether it had ever been used as a goal of American policy.</p>
                <p>My theme was that it was in our interest to work with other countries. We needed
                    to work to build a new, Pacific Community. I started out by listing all of our
                    interests in Asia. I won't go through them, as it's not necessary here. However,
                    they included security, political, historical, cultural, economic, and social
                    interests. The fact is that we have a growing number of immigrants coming from
                    Asia. Our population is moving from the East Coast to the West Coast. These are
                    all reasons why Asia is already crucial and will be even more so in the next
                    century. I included the statement that there is no part of the world more
                    important to United States interests than the Pacific region.</p>
                <p>I set out that view, in addition to the usual introduction about my background,
                    the honor I felt at having been chosen for this post, and pledging to work with
                    Congress. Then I went into the importance of our interests in Asia. One of the
                    themes I used, and I'll get more specific in a minute, was that we had to pursue
                    our bilateral interests by all means, as these were crucial to the U.S. I wasn't
                    suddenly saying that there was a community already existing out in Asia. That
                    was more a vision than a reality. So there was a mix of going over the key,
                    bilateral relationships, with heavy emphasis also on trying to build more of a
                    community in the Pacific area, even as we have already done in Europe. However,
                    I made clear that the concept of a Pacific Community was a lot different from a
                    European Community.</p>
                <p>I laid out 10 goals. I would like to keep this very brief, but they were
                    basically as follows. I purposely put Japan first, as I thought that it was our
                    most crucial partner. Particularly since I have a heavy China background, I
                    wanted to make clear to everyone else, including the Japanese, that I thought
                    that Japan was the most important country in terms of U.S. interests. I put
                    South Korea second because it was another key ally and the site of the most
                    urgent security challenge. Then I got to China and the others. I'll just read
                    off the Ten Goals, because that's the easiest way to review them.</p>
                <pb facs="0581" n="Page0581"/>
                <p>I mentioned our need to forge a fresh, global partnership with Japan that
                    reflects a more mature balance of responsibility. Global partnership means not
                    only our bilateral relationship but increasingly working with Japan on many
                    regional and global issues, as well as a more mature balance of
                    responsibilities, meaning that Japan needs to assume, in conjunction with the
                    U.S. but also in terms of its own self interest, more responsibility in the
                    world. I was trying to be very careful in my drafting.</p>
                <p>Secondly, I mentioned erasing the nuclear threat and moving toward peaceful
                    reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula. This was aimed at disposing of the
                    problem and then trying to build a more stable and long lasting solution.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, restoring firm foundations for cooperation with China, where political
                    openness should catch up with economic reform. That is, trying to restore
                    momentum in the Chinese-U.S. relationship, in cooperation with China, but also
                    working in the fact that political openness needed to catch up with economic
                    reform. I tried to go into both the strategic interests and also the concern for
                    freedom.</p>
                <p>Fourthly, I referred to the need to deepen our relationship with ASEAN
                    [Association of Southeast Asian Nations], as it broadens its membership and
                    scope. I wanted to make clear that although much emphasis had been placed on the
                    big actors in Northeast Asia, ASEAN was really growing as a major economic and
                    diplomatic power in many ways. I also made clear, consistent with my overall
                    theme, that we not only had to deal with ASEAN as a group of countries, as a
                    part of building a Pacific Community, but also the U.S. had very important,
                    bilateral relationships within ASEAN which we also had to nurture.</p>
                <p>Then I referred to obtaining the fullest possible accounting on our Missing in
                    Action, as we normalized our relations with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.
                    Of course, I put the accounting of our MIAs first, as we always did, we had to
                    do, and we should do also. We needed to do this, both in terms of what we needed
                    to do but also in terms of building domestic support for this policy. However, I
                    worked in the phrase, “As we normalize our relations with Vietnam.” This
                    involved stretching the envelope a little bit because I was projecting the
                    normalization of relations with Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Then I went on to speak of working to secure a peaceful, independent, and
                    democratic Cambodia. Cambodia was scheduled to have elections in May, 1993, so
                    that was an urgent goal. I went on to refer to ASEAN in its collective dimension
                    as being key on this issue as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0582" n="Page0582"/>
                <p>The last four goals were sectoral and essentially oriented more toward a Pacific
                    Community, speaking in collective terms.I spoke of strengthening APEC as the
                    cornerstone of Asian Pacific economic cooperation. APEC is the Asian Pacific
                    Economic Cooperation forum, which is not the world's greatest title. It was not
                    self-evident that, in listing 10 goals in the Pacific Region, we would include
                    APEC. At this point APEC had been going for a few years, beginning with the Bush
                    Administration, but it hadn't achieved much of a profile or attracted much
                    interest. I wanted to talk about our economic interests in Asia in general,
                    which obviously were crucial. However, I also wanted to make clear that APEC
                    would be a major vehicle for promoting our economic interests, and I'll get back
                    to that.</p>
                <p>So I put that in. The order of these goals was important. I wouldn't argue that
                    all 10 goals were equally important, but I put strengthening APEC down as one of
                    these goals. Then I got to the security goal, subtly making the point that in
                    our new foreign policy economics was at least as important as security, unlike
                    during the period of the Cold War.</p>
                <p>On security, and here I was pushing the envelope again, I spoke of developing
                    multilateral forums for security consultations, while maintaining the solid
                    foundations of our alliances. I'll go into more detail on this, but I would
                    point out that the Bush Administration, with some plausible reason, was very
                    skittish and reluctant to push regional security schemes. They were concerned
                    about the old threat from the Brezhnev Doctrine and the implications of
                    collective responsibility. They didn't want anything that looked as if we were
                    walking away from our bilateral and unilateral security obligations and
                    replacing them with some fuzzy, regional mechanisms. They didn't want to signal
                    to anybody that we were pulling out of East Asia. They were worried that if we
                    put too much emphasis on regional security dialogues, we would look naive. They
                    felt that Asia wasn't Europe, where we have NATO as a long established,
                    defensive alliance.</p>
                <p>I believed that these interests and considerations were not mutually exclusive.
                    So I made it very clear that we should maintain the solid foundations of our
                    alliances and our forward, military presence. However, as long as we keep our
                    alliances and our forward, military presence as the foundations of our policies,
                    we could supplement and not supplant them with regional security dialogues. This
                    concept was pretty much embryonic at that point, but I signaled in this
                    statement that we were going to emphasize these dialogues and forums. Again,
                    this concept was not particularly controversial, but it was a new departure,
                    versus the views of the Bush administration in terms of our emphasis. I was
                    signaling that.</p>
                <p>Both the APEC and regional security dialogues were picked up by the President in
                    his first few months. He lifted APEC to the summit level, and he suggested
                    overlapping regional security approaches in addition to our alliances and
                    military presence in a major security speech in South Korea.</p>
                <pb facs="0583" n="Page0583"/>
                <p>Then I referred to spurring regional cooperation to deal with global challenges
                    like the environment, refugees, health, narcotics, nuclear non-proliferation,
                    and arms sales. This reflected the new foreign policy agenda and some of the
                    issues involved. Actually, these issues were not all new, but they were growing
                    in importance. Secretary Christopher would have a new Under Secretary for Global
                    Affairs, for example. Nuclear non-proliferation, the environment, and so forth
                    were very important. I knew that President Clinton was interested in some of
                    these issues, so I wanted to make sure that they were highlighted on the agenda.
                    Again, I felt that regional as well as global cooperation could contribute to
                    our positions in the Pacific and to meeting these problems.</p>
                <p>Then, finally, and because the last goal is almost as prominent as the first goal
                    in an agenda, I put down promoting democracy and human rights where freedom has
                    yet to flower. This goal underlay and would contribute to all our other goals.
                    So I ended with it, not to mention the rhetorical value.</p>
                <p>So those were the ten goals, and I went into greater depth on each one. As I
                    said, I think that the statement was well received and I'm glad that I went to
                    the trouble I did.A NEW PACIFIC COMMUNITYTEN GOALS FOR AMERICAN POLICY</p>
                <p>Opening Statement at Confirmation Hearingsfor Ambassador Winston LordAssistant
                    Secretary of State-DesignateBureau of East Asian and Pacific AffairsMarch 31,
                    1993</p>
                <p>Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee:</p>
                <p>President Clinton has honored me with his nomination as Assistant Secretary of
                    State for East Asia and the Pacific. I am grateful for the trust that he and
                    Secretary Christopher have invested in mc to help shape America's policy for
                    this critical region.</p>
                <p>If I am confirmed, our exchange today will be the first step in a journey
                    charted-by thorough consultation and cooperation, This I pledge in the national
                    interest and my own self-interest. There 'is much to be learned from your
                    perspectives and those of the American people. There is much to be gained when
                    policies are jointly crafted.</p>
                <p>Thus, in addition to ad hoc exchanges on breaking issues, I will maintain a
                    process of regular meetings, on the Hill and in the Department, with key members
                    of Congress and their staffs. I also intend, as both opportunity and
                    responsibility, to traverse this nation to listen to Americans and clarify our
                    Asian-Pacific policies.</p>
                <pb facs="0584" n="Page0584"/>
                <p>I come to this assignment with a global perspective based on three decades of
                    international experience in the Government and non-profit sector. I am foremost
                    a generalist - as a Foreign Service officer with varied assignments, a member of
                    the Defense Department's Policy Planning Staff, Special Assistant to the
                    President's National Security Advisor, and Director of the State Department's
                    Policy Planning Staff. Outside government I have served as President of the
                    Council on Foreign Relations, Chairman of the National Endowment for Democracy,
                    Vice Chairman of the International Rescue Committee, and Chairman of the
                    Carnegie National Commission on America and the New World. Throughout I have
                    dealt extensively with Asian issues, including as Ambassador to China and as
                    director and member of many organizations with emphasis on that region.</p>
                <p>Above all I come in the spirit of bipartisanship, with a record of service under
                    all but one Administration since Kennedy. I am gratified to have been selected
                    by both Presidents Reagan and Clinton for positions requiring Senate
                    confirmation. Seasoning has sharpened, not mellowed, my conviction that the
                    greater our unity at home, the greater our success abroad. America has permanent
                    interests. They do not change every four years.A New Pacific Community</p>
                <p>Today no region in the world is more important for the United Statethan Asia and
                    the Pacific.</p>
                <p>Tomorrow, in the twenty-first century, no region will be as important.</p>
                <p>In that vast area most of the world's people live. Many of the richest cultures
                    flourish. The most dynamic economies beckon. The major powers intersect.</p>
                <p>America has fought in three wars in Asia during the past half century. We have
                    abiding security interests there. Forty percent of our trade is with the region,
                    its share swelling more rapidly than that of any other, and half again as large
                    as with Western Europe. More and more eager, talented Asian immigrants enrich
                    America's cultural and economic mosaic. Our nation's population and production
                    shift steadily toward our Pacific Coast.</p>
                <p>In sum, the firmest guarantees of America's staying power in Asia - more credible
                    than rhetoric from the rostrum or writs on paper - are our overriding national
                    interests.</p>
                <p>Ever since the Vietnam War we have enjoyed broad bipartisan consensus on the most
                    salient policies in the Asia-Pacific region, this has contributed mightily to
                    our successes. But in recent years, preoccupied by crises in Europe and the
                    Middle East, we have paid insufficient attention to major transformations
                    underway across the Pacific. Our Asian partners have noticed. Some are
                    apprehensive.</p>
                <pb facs="0585" n="Page0585"/>
                <p>Asia has been moving from an arena of confrontations to the premier growth area
                    of the world. Economic, political, and cultural exchanges within this region
                    have mushroomed. Familiar landmarks are shifting. New patterns are taking shape.
                    New generations are taking charge: We risk squandering assets and lagging behind
                    trends.</p>
                <p>We have enormous stakes in the Pacific. We need to integrate our economic,
                    political and security policies. We need fresh approaches and structures of
                    cooperation.</p>
                <p>It is time to build - with others a New Pacific Community.</p>
                <p>A survey of the regional landscape yields both hopes and hazards:</p>
                <p>- It includes the world's fastest-growing economies and most lucrative terrain
                    for American exports and jobs. But we risk losing markets to aggressive
                    competitors, and we are running unacceptable deficits with some of them.</p>
                <p>- The end of the Cold War eased relations among regional powers and deflated
                    regional conflicts. But some of our bilateral ties are frayed or fragile and new
                    security challenges cloud the horizon.</p>
                <p>- Global revolutions in technology, transportation and communications lift the
                    hopes and prospects for countless Asians. But global risks resonate ominously in
                    the area - the proliferation of dangerous weapons, the burgeoning of
                    populations, the spectre of AIDS, the degradation of the environment, the
                    spawning of refugees, the traffic in drugs.</p>
                <p>- The universal tides of democracy, fanned by information and free markets, flow
                    in the region. But four of the world's last five communist regimes, together
                    with other repressive governments, remain caught in a time warp in Asia.</p>
                <p>How then do we remove the peril and realize the promise?</p>
                <p>Foreign policy for the region - as for the world at large - begins at home.
                    President Clinton has wisely declared the renewal of America as his supreme
                    goal. This is not only essential for the American people. It is essential for
                    American interests and values abroad. As the Carnegie Commission, which I
                    recently chaired, stated, “First, our foreign policy must be founded on a
                    renewal of our domestic strength; rebuilding our economic base' is now our
                    highest priority.”</p>
                <p>Equally compelling is the need to perfect the American experiment in democracy.
                    We must practice at home what we preach overseas. We can project to troubled
                    countries a multi-ethnic society that reconciles the need for national purpose
                    with the right of groups to be distinctive. As President Eisenhower once said,
                    “Whatever America hopes to bring to pass in the world must first come to pass in
                    the heart of America.”</p>
                <pb facs="0586" n="Page0586"/>
                <p>There can be no greater contribution to our Asian policy than fostering domestic
                    economic vigor and social cohesion in America. Our Asian friends recognize this.
                    Progress at home will burnish our leadership credentials. It will make us
                    competitive in the marketplace of goods and credible in the marketplace of
                    values. It will help secure the resources needed for international action. And
                    it will steady popular support without which our foreign policy founders.</p>
                <p>Looking forward, we can see ten major goals for American policy in Asia and the
                    Pacific. They are not listed in any order but rather as parameters of
                    progress.</p>
                <p>- Forging a fresh global partnership with Japan that reflects a mormature balance
                    of responsibilities.</p>
                <p>- Erasing the nuclear threat and moving toward peacefureconciliation on the
                    Korean peninsula.</p>
                <p>- Restoring firm foundations for cooperation with a China wherpolitical openness
                    catches up with economic reform.</p>
                <p>- Deepening our ties with ASEAN as it broadens its membership anscope.</p>
                <p>- Obtaining the fullest possible accounting of our missing in actioas we
                    normalize our relations with Vietnam.</p>
                <p>- Securing a peaceful, independent and democratic Cambodia.</p>
                <p>- Strengthening APEC as the cornerstone of Asian-Pacific economicooperation.</p>
                <p>- Developing multilateral forums for security consultations whilmaintaining the
                    solid foundations of our alliances.</p>
                <p>- Spurring regional cooperation on global challenges like the environment,
                    refugees, health, narcotics, non-proliferation and arms sales.</p>
                <p>- Promoting democracy and human rights where freedom has yet tflower. Let me
                    briefly elaborate on each one.</p>
                <p>Japan</p>
                <p>Our fortunes in Asia, indeed the world; will hinge on developing a comprehensive,
                    durable partnership with Japan. This will be my highest priority.</p>
                <pb facs="0587" n="Page0587"/>
                <p>Together Japan and America comprise forty percent of the world's GNP. Our
                    alliance reassures friends, promotes stability, and deters arms races. We are -
                    or must become - partners on issues ranging from Korea to Somalia, Cambodia to
                    Russia, technology to foreign aid, the environment to democracy.</p>
                <p>We offer our Japanese friends both reassurance about our intentions and a sense
                    of urgency about festering frictions. We will maintain a substantial military
                    presence in Asia.</p>
                <p>We will strive energetically to open markets. Japan will have our strong support
                    for a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council; while complex
                    negotiations are underway, we will consult Tokyo systematically on all major
                    issues before the world organization.</p>
                <p>In return, equity and reality require more vigorous Japanese performance on
                    economic issues and international responsibilities. An open global economic
                    system is crucial to that country's future. Its current account surplus of 125
                    billion dollars strains that system; its 49 billion dollar surplus with us
                    creates severe tension. During the past decade our deficits with Japan have
                    totaled almost half a trillion dollars.</p>
                <p>We are addressing this imbalance on several fronts - making the American economy
                    more competitive; urging Japanese macroeconomic measures to stimulate demand and
                    imports; implementing agreements already negotiated; and achieving concrete
                    export and investment results in selected areas.</p>
                <p>Globally, Japan has already taken some promising initiatives ranging from
                    peacekeeping to foreign assistance. But Japan's aspirations for a central seat
                    at world councils should be bolstered by contributions worthy of a major
                    political and economic power.</p>
                <p>It is time to shape a global partnership with Japan. Together we should thicken
                    webs of consultations and cooperation on three levels. On the global plane, we
                    should collaborate on the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, the G-7 process,
                    UN peacekeeping missions, and international challenges such as
                    non-proliferation, the environment, refugees, health-, human rights and
                    democracy. On the regional plane, we should together nourish economic
                    institutions like APEC and security consultations on a range of issues. On the
                    bilateral plane, we should pursue a structure of economic consultations and
                    deepen our dialogue on our respective policies toward major nations like Korea,
                    Russia, and China.</p>
                <p>In this way we can forge a more equitable, positive partnership. America will
                    listen more, lecture less. In turn, Japan should step forward, not in response
                    to American entreaties or pressure, but in a spirit of enlightened self-interest
                    and mutual benefit.</p>
                <p>Korea</p>
                <pb facs="0588" n="Page0588"/>
                <p>The Korean Peninsula reflects at once remarkable progress, tenuouopenings, and
                    lurking dangers.</p>
                <p>The Republic of Korea represents one of Asia's greatest success stories. Its
                    economic growth has been little short of astonishing. Its diplomacy has scored a
                    series of breakthroughs. It is steadily shouldering more of its self-defense.
                    Its continued movement toward democracy - crowned by the recent inauguration of
                    a President who had spent three decades in opposition - heartens those living
                    under authoritarian regimes elsewhere in the region.</p>
                <p>We applaud these advances even as we work towards greater economic cooperation
                    and reforms on intellectual property rights, financial liberalization, the
                    investment climate and market access.</p>
                <p>But the threat from the North remains the most perilous legacy of the Cold War.
                    Prodded by a disastrous economy and estrangement from its major patrons,
                    Pyongyang has toyed with opening toward the outside world: After some promising
                    moves in the past two. years, North Korea currently seems to be retreating
                    toward paranoia. In recent weeks it has fueled anxieties in the region by first
                    reneging on commitments to inspection of its nuclear facilities and then
                    declaring its intention to withdraw from the Non-proliferation Treaty. Looming
                    ahead are the profound uncertainties of its political succession.</p>
                <p>The policy lines of the United States are clear and consistent. We will maintain
                    significant military forces in South Korea as long as Americans and Koreans
                    believe they are needed for deterrence and regional stability. We will continue
                    to support fully the IAEA and other international bodies to eliminate the North
                    Korean nuclear threat. North Korea's nuclear challenge is to the world
                    community, not just to the United States, as Pyongyang seeks to portray it. This
                    problem is critical to the worldwide campaign to stem proliferation.</p>
                <p>The future of the Peninsula must be resolved essentially through direct
                    South-North negotiations; we remain prepared to enhance this process through
                    close consultation with our South Korean ally and multilateral diplomacy. We
                    also stand ready to improve our relations with North Korea if it cooperates on
                    fundamental issues.</p>
                <p>China</p>
                <p>Ever since participating in the opening to China more than two decades ago, I
                    have worked hard to build Sino-American relations. I will continue to do so,
                    conscious of both American interests and values.</p>
                <pb facs="0589" n="Page0589"/>
                <p>China is an influential member of the international order. More than one of every
                    five humans live there. It possesses nuclear weapons and exports nuclear
                    technology. It launches satellites and sells missiles. It represents a huge
                    market and one of the world's richest civilizations. It holds a permanent seat
                    on the United Nations Security Council. It is central to key regional issues
                    like Indochina, Korea, and disputed islands. It abuts the unsettled Central Asia
                    region. It is salient in new challenges that require global action.</p>
                <p>In recent years, China has opened up to the world, moved toward a market economy,
                    and enjoyed the fastest growth rate in the world. Together with the greater
                    Chinese communities of Taiwan and Hong Kong it has become one of the most
                    promising areas for investment and trade.</p>
                <p>At the same time, its leaders cling to an outdated authoritarian system. Serious
                    abuses persist. While Beijing releases some prominent activists toward the end
                    of their jail sentences, it arrests others for the peaceful expression of
                    political views. The Chinese leaders are gambling that open economics and closed
                    politics will preserve their system of control. It is a gamble that sooner or
                    later will be lost. Economic reform produces - and requires - political reform.
                    In today's world, nations cannot prosper for long without Opening up their
                    societies. Technology and information, the forces of modernization, and global
                    democratic trends have been eroding communism and totalitarianism across the
                    globe.</p>
                <p>All of the Asian models of economic success toward which China looks - many of
                    them Chinese societies - have shown that political relaxation, tolerance of
                    opposition a freer press, the rule of law and other democratic elements are
                    inescapably linked with economic development.</p>
                <p>Our policy challenge therefore is to reconcile our need to deal with this
                    important nation with our imperative to promote international values, we will
                    Seek cooperation with China on a range of issues. But Americans cannot forget
                    Tiananmen Square.</p>
                <p>The United States therefore should conduct a nuanced policy toward Beijing until
                    a more humane system emerges. Shunning China is not an alternative. We need both
                    to condemn repression and preserve links with progressive forces which are the
                    foundations for our longer term ties.</p>
                <p>We will continue to be guided by the three Sino-American joint communiques that
                    have provided a flexible framework for our relations. It is up to China and
                    Taiwan to work out their future relationship; we insist only that the process be
                    peaceful. Consistent with our undertakings not to challenge the principle of
                    “one China,” we will continue to build upon our unofficial relations with Taiwan
                    based on the Taiwan Relations Act. In our diplomacy and through the 1992
                    U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act we should make clear our large humanitarian and
                    commercial stakes in the future of Hong Kong.</p>
                <pb facs="0590" n="Page0590"/>
                <p>Against this backdrop we face a host of serious issues with China: Widespread
                    human rights violations, including in Tibet. Chinese exports of dangerous
                    weapons and technology to volatile areas. Our fastest-growing trade deficit,
                    which is now more than 18 billion dollars, second only to Japan. Collaboration
                    at the United Nations and on regional conflicts. Emerging challenges like the
                    environment and drugs. We should work together where our interests converge and
                    bargain hard over differences.</p>
                <p>We will press forward with this agenda in a sober, constructive fashion. Our
                    approach will reflect that China is a great nation. In response to positive
                    movement by the Chinese, we are prepared to address their concerns and
                    strengthen our ties.</p>
                <p>The Chinese people hold the same aspirations as others around the globe. We will
                    support those aspirations - without arrogance - recognizing that the Chinese
                    people will determine their own destiny, but confident that we are aligning
                    ourselves with the future.</p>
                <p>ASEAN</p>
                <p>The ASEAN nations, with 330 million people, boast some of the fastest-growing
                    economies and became last year our fourth-largest overseas market. We welcome
                    ASEAN's establishment this January of the world's newest free trade grouping. By
                    the year 2000, ASEAN could become a trillion dollar economic area encompassing
                    eleven countries. We will therefore intensify our efforts to promote U.S.
                    exports and the jobs they create. Last year a successful American tour by our
                    Ambassadors to ASEAN raised awareness of this dynamic region. We will continue
                    such efforts to attract more American Farms to this competitive market.</p>
                <p>This institution, 25 years young, serves regional stability as well as
                    prosperity. The future admission of the Indochina countries would encourage them
                    in constructive directions. The ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference, which brings
                    together the Ministers of ASEAN and seven other nations, is evolving into an
                    increasingly important forum for regional security consultations. Imaginative
                    diplomacy by Indonesia and others has been crucial in moving the Cambodian peace
                    process forward and exploring peaceful ways to resolve competing claims in the
                    South China Sea.</p>
                <p>With the closing of our military facilities in the Philippines, we are gradually
                    developing a diversified pattern of security ties in Southeast Asia. All the
                    ASEAN countries view a continuing U.S. military presence as a stabilizing
                    element during an uncertain period; each in its own way is helping to make it
                    possible. Our commitments to Thailand and the Philippines - both exemplars of
                    democratic advance - remain firm. We welcome more cordial relations with
                    Malaysia. We will strengthen those with Singapore and Brunei.</p>
                <p>The United States will accord ASEAN and its individual countries the growing
                    attention they merit - for American trade and investment, for regional security,
                    for the extension of freedom.</p>
                <pb facs="0591" n="Page0591"/>
                <p>Vietnam</p>
                <p>We are taking an especially close look at our policy towards Vietnam. Let me
                    emphasize that obtaining the fullest possible accounting for Americans missing
                    from the Vietnam War, including those lost in Laos and Cambodia, will remain a
                    central objective.</p>
                <p>I have reviewed the findings of the Senate's Select Committee on POW/MIA, before
                    which I was honored to testify. The Senate's exhaustive examination of this
                    highly-charged issue was a major achievement. I congratulate the Committee,
                    whose findings have served to narrow uncertainties and ease some of the
                    families' pain. Most of the twenty-year record of Hanoi on this issue has been
                    one of callousness and deceit, but we can be encouraged that the Senate Select
                    Committee has confirmed that Vietnamese cooperation with our investigations has
                    substantially improved: While we may never find all the answers, this
                    Administration will make every effort to accelerate the process. We must secure
                    whatever comfort we can for the families of the missing.</p>
                <p>I assure you as well that we will vigorously pursue POW/MIA issuewith Pyongyang,
                    Moscow and Beijing.</p>
                <p>Looking to the future, Vietnam, a rapidly-growing country of 70 million, the
                    fourth largest in East Asia, can play an important political and economic role.
                    If the necessary groundwork is laid we can strengthen regional stability. A key
                    factor will be the political settlement in Cambodia. Vietnam has taken a
                    positive role to date in the UN peace process; we expect its full support for
                    the elections in May and the establishment of a new, independent Cambodian
                    government.</p>
                <p>On the economic side, Vietnam has undertaken market reforms, opening up promising
                    vistas for trade and investment. The American business community is eager to
                    take advantage of these opportunities and compete effectively with others.</p>
                <p>At the same time, Vietnam continues under a repressive Communist political
                    system. There are scant traces of freedom. As we seek to normalize relations,
                    the intensity and warmth of our ties will depend on progress in this area.</p>
                <p>The graduated, reciprocal policy of recent years has successfully induced the
                    Vietnamese to be more cooperative on the POW/MIA and Cambodian issues. South
                    Vietnamese personnel have been released from re-education camps. Now we need to
                    consider how further steps toward normalization can serve our multiple
                    objectives.</p>
                <p>With Vietnam's cooperation we are prepared to heal the wounds ohistory.</p>
                <p>Cambodia</p>
                <pb facs="0592" n="Page0592"/>
                <p>Cambodia continues to be a land of tragedy, torn by two decades owar and ravaged
                    by the brutal policies of the Khmer Rouge.</p>
                <p>After arduous diplomacy involving many nations, the fragile outlines of a
                    settlement Finally emerged - cease fire, demobilization, a large United Nations
                    presence and free elections leading to an independent Cambodian government. Even
                    more is at stake here than the fate of that country and regional security. The
                    UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia - UNTAC - is the largest Peacekeeping
                    operation in the history of the United Nations. Thus we face a crucial test of
                    multilateral peacekeeping by the international community.</p>
                <p>The situation is Precarious. The headlines are grim. Yet UNTAC has recorded some
                    impressive achievements. The 20,000 peacekeepers have managed a ceasefire for
                    over a year. UNTAC has registered over 95%of the eligible voters for the
                    elections slated for May. Almost all of the 360,000 Cambodian refugees have been
                    repatriated; the detaining and repairing of the country's infrastructure goes
                    forward.</p>
                <p>Formidable obstacles remain. The Khmer Rouge refuse to participate in the
                    elections; they seek to disrupt them; they are apparently hunkering down for a
                    long-term struggle to take over the nation. The Cambodian government, installed
                    by Hanoi in 1979, fears repudiation at the polls; it is using violence to
                    intimidate potential voters; it threatens to discredit the election results.</p>
                <p>There will be no easy path through this thicket. Working with others, the United
                    States must support the process of free and fair elections and assist the
                    government that emerges. The immediate task for UNTAC is to convince the
                    Cambodian people that their votes will be secret and that their votes will
                    count. The looming policy choices before the world community include the ongoing
                    role of the United Nations; the means to strengthen the future government, and
                    the ways to contain the genocidal Khmer Rouge and others who seek to undermine
                    the settlement.</p>
                <p>One of the most complex and central tasks for our Asian policy will be to help
                    provide the Cambodians with a brighter future. No other people deserve peace
                    more.</p>
                <p>Economics</p>
                <p>In the aftermath of the Cold War, economics is increasingly supplanting military
                    considerations on our foreign policy agenda. More than ever our national
                    security depends on our economic strength. With domestic renewal now America's
                    highest priority, trade and investment are critical. And no region is more
                    central for American economic interests than the world's most dynamic one -
                    Asia.</p>
                <pb facs="0593" n="Page0593"/>
                <p>When I served as Ambassador to China, I devoted more time to promoting American
                    business and economic interests than any other task. I will do so as well in my
                    forthcoming role. I will consult closely with the American business community on
                    their problems and their goals. I will urge our overseas posts to do the same.
                    For the private sector in Asia, as elsewhere around the world, is an
                    increasingly important actor. Helping American businesses to penetrate overseas
                    markets will be key to America's prosperity.</p>
                <p>The Asia-Pacific region is the world's largest consumer market and our biggest
                    export market. Last year our exports were worth more than 120 billion dollars
                    and 2.3 million American jobs.</p>
                <p>We need to confront our Asian economic challenges and opportunities on several
                    levels. Foreign policy begins at home - strengthening our competitiveness is a
                    sine qua non for an effective policy. The successful completion of the Uruguay
                    Round is the most urgent multilateral task - this would dramatically increase
                    trade and investment in Asia as in the world, and it would help preserve an open
                    global system against the dangers of protectionism and regional blocs. We
                    welcome the positive role played by Australia and New Zealand as active Cairns
                    Group members. Here, as on other issues, we will consult closely with Canada.
                    Bilaterally we must continue to pry open Asian markets, Particularly in those
                    nations running large surpluses with us. We will champion expanding trade but we
                    will insist that others open up to our products and services. As the President
                    has said, we will compete, not retreat.</p>
                <p>In addition to these domestic, global, and bilateral policies,greater regional
                    cooperation is required.</p>
                <p>The most promising vehicle is APEC, established in 1989 through the efforts of
                    Australia and others. Today this trans-Pacific grouping brings together fifteen
                    Pacific economies representing almost half of the world's GNP. It underscores
                    the new imperatives of interdependence. It can dampen the appeal of exclusionary
                    regional blocs. It can advance regional trade liberalization and integration. It
                    can anchor America in the world's most dynamic region.</p>
                <p>As the host for this year's annual Ministerial Conference in November, the United
                    States has the opportunity to strengthen this organization. This will be at the
                    top of our agenda this year. Working with others we can create a true
                    Asian-Pacific economic community.</p>
                <p>Security</p>
                <pb facs="0594" n="Page0594"/>
                <p>By virtue of history and geography the United States is the one major power in
                    Asia not viewed as a threat. Virtually every country wants us to maintain our
                    security presence. While balance-of-power considerations have declined in the
                    wake of the Cold War, they remain relevant as Asian-Pacific nations contemplate
                    their fates. Each one harbors apprehensions about one or more of its neighbors.
                    A precipitous American military withdrawal would magnify these concerns. Add the
                    increasing resources available for weapons purchases in the rapidly growing
                    Asian nations and there is a recipe for escalating arms races and future
                    confrontations that could threaten U.S. interests.</p>
                <p>American security policy for Asia begins with a reaffirmation of our treaty
                    alliances with Japan, Korea, Australia, Thailand, and the Philippines; our
                    military arrangements under the Compact of Free Association; and the maintenance
                    of a substantial military presence. To be sure given the end of the Cold War,
                    stronger friends, and budget considerations, there could be prudent
                    modifications after close consultation with our allies. And they can and must
                    assume a growing share of the security burden.</p>
                <p>Unlike other regions, crises in Asia do not dominate the headlines, but serious
                    security problems persist. Those left over from the Cold War - such as the
                    Cambodian conflict and tensions on the Korean Peninsulare being addressed by the
                    appropriate groupings of nations. The dispute between Japan - whom we support -
                    and Russia over the Northern Territories belongs to bilateral negotiations.</p>
                <p>Clearly, however, we must develop new mechanisms to manage or prevent other
                    emerging concerns. We welcome increased security consultations in the framework
                    of the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference. This process can usefully encourage
                    nations to share information, convey intentions, ease tensions, resolve disputes
                    and foster confidence. The United States will fully participate.</p>
                <p>For the first time in this century, there are no adversarial fault lines among
                    the great powers in Northeast Asia: the United States, Japan, Russia and China.
                    The post Cold War period invites dialogue to prevent arms races, the forging of
                    competing alignments, and efforts by one power or group of powers to dominate
                    this strategic region. Our voice will be crucial. In close concert with our
                    Pacific allies, we could engage Russia, China and others inside and outside
                    Northeast Asia.</p>
                <p>Asia is not Europe. We do not envisage a formal CSCE-type structure. But it is
                    time to step up regional discussions on future security issues. We are
                    open-minded on the arenas. We will heed the ideas of others, like Japan,
                    Australia, and ASEAN, which have been particularly fertile in this domain.
                    Together we can explore new Asian-Pacific paths toward security.</p>
                <p>Global Issues</p>
                <pb facs="0595" n="Page0595"/>
                <p>President Clinton and his Cabinet officers have already moved to restructure the
                    executive branch to meet the new global challenges in our foreign policy. These
                    issues loom large in Asia and the Pacific. They will assume increasing
                    prominence on our regional agenda as we approach the twenty-first century.</p>
                <p>A brief checklist illustrates some of these problems:</p>
                <p>- With the end of global superpower rivalry the proliferation of dangerous
                    weapons now poses the greatest threat to our security. In Asia, North Korean
                    programs currently dramatize this challenge.</p>
                <p>- It took until 1830 for the world's population to reach one billion people. Now
                    it increases by that number every decade, with 90% of the growth in developing
                    countries. Asia, East and South, is home to half the world's people. Twenty
                    years from now a billion more people will live there.</p>
                <p>- Many measures of human impact - from water use to the emissions of trace gases
                    -show greater change since 1950 than in the previous 10,000 years. The Asian
                    region, with its massive increase in energy consumption, faces severe
                    environmental problems. They range from the plundering of Southeast Asian
                    forests to China's burning of coal to the threat of global warming for some
                    Pacific Island states.</p>
                <p>- There are almost 20 million refugees in the world today. Even more people are
                    uprooted within their own lands. While some recent developments in Asia are
                    promising, poverty, repression and uncertain political succession could unleash
                    major migrations in the future.</p>
                <p>- The traffic in drugs remains a scourge on American society. Although the battle
                    must be won at home by eliminating demand, the supply of narcotics from Burma
                    and neighboring countries exacerbates our calamity.</p>
                <p>Surely this is a daunting array of issues. But problems common to all nations can
                    stimulate communities. They can be positive additions to our bilateral and
                    regional dialogues. And if they are not addressed effectively in Asia, they can
                    hardly be addressed by the world.</p>
                <p>Increasingly we will inject these global subjects into our relations. We will
                    also encourage new institutions, like APEC, to enhance regional consultations
                    and Cooperation.</p>
                <p>Democracy and Human Rights</p>
                <p>History is on the side of freedom. In recent years hundreds of millions of people
                    have won more open political systems. For the first time ever a majority of the
                    world's nations are governed by some form of democracy.</p>
                <pb facs="0596" n="Page0596"/>
                <p>This spread of liberty not only affirms American values but also serves our
                    interests. Open societies do not attack one another. They make better trading
                    partners. They press for environmental reform. They do not practice terrorism.
                    They do not produce refugees. Thus, as President Clinton has emphasized,
                    promoting democracy must be one of the central pillars of our foreign policy.
                    Moreover, the end of our global rivalry with the Soviet Union reduces the
                    Pressure to muffle concerns about unsavory governments for the sake of
                    security.</p>
                <p>Naturally this pursuit cannot be our only foreign goal; we must weigh
                    geopolitical, economic and other factors. Nor do we seek to impose an American
                    model; each nation must find its own way in its own cultural and historical
                    contexts. But universal Principles of freedom and human rights belong to all,
                    the peoples of Asia no less than others.</p>
                <p>Mongolia was the first Asian country to throw off the communist yoke. From Korea
                    to Taiwan to Thailand and the Philippines, we have witnessed encouraging strides
                    toward more democratic and humane societies. This phenomenon is not a product of
                    “Westernization;” rather it is an imperative of “modernization.” How can
                    countries attract investment without the rule of law? How can they combat
                    corruption without a free press? How Can they shape wise development policies
                    without the unfettered exchange of ideas? In an age of technology and
                    information it is impossible for nations to develop without pluralism and
                    openness. And Sooner or later - accelerated by exposure to television and
                    tourists, fax machines and cellular telephones, cassettes and computers -
                    economic advance produces political yearnings.</p>
                <p>To be sure, areas of Asia lag behind the march of history. First-generation
                    Communist leaders still hold together repressive regimes in several countries.
                    Grave human rights violations continue from Tibet to Rangoon to East Timor. But
                    it is only a matter of time before the impact of economic reforms, the
                    transmission of international values, and the thrust of human aspirations lead
                    to sunnier climes.</p>
                <p>The remainder of this century will be marked by a series oportentous successions
                    in Asia.</p>
                <p>Thus, even as we deal pragmatically with authoritarian governments we should
                    press universal principles. Whenever possible we should work with others to
                    expand the frontiers of freedom.</p>
                <p>There are many instruments at our disposal - consistent public positions that
                    eschew double standards; quiet diplomacy; multilateral organizations; selective
                    conditioning of foreign aid; and the efforts of private organizations like the
                    National Endowment for Democracy and the Asia Foundation. The establishment of a
                    Radio Free Asia will be a vital supplement to the Voice of America and will
                    signal our commitment to liberty.</p>
                <p>Conclusion</p>
                <pb facs="0597" n="Page0597"/>
                <p>Today a Pacific Community is a vision. Tomorrow it can become reality.</p>
                <p>The initial contours, eased by the end of the Cold War and strengthened by the
                    dynamism of the region, are already emerging. The rapid growth of trade and
                    investment within the area. The increasing integration of economies,
                    technologies, and ecologies. The deepening of ASEAN and its expanding dialogue.
                    The promising evolution of APEC. The beginnings of regional security
                    consultations. The spread of freedom.</p>
                <p>These are promising trends. They reflect the foresight of the region's leaders
                    and the energies of its peoples. They also reflect the achievements of a
                    bipartisan American foreign policy that has supported for half a century a huge
                    investment of our national treasure.</p>
                <p>It would be a tragic error for America to rest on its oars. That would tempt the
                    forces of adversity, sowing conflict rather than cooperation.</p>
                <p>This generation of Americans owes it to the labors of those who came before us,
                    and the hopes of our successors, to help build a new Pacific Community.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] You made these points, and there was this concern by the Bureau of
                    Congressional Relations you have referred to. How did the hearings go? There is
                    always the wild card of Senator Helms, the conservative, Republican Senator from
                    North Carolina. I would have thought that he would not be your friend.</p>
                <p>LORD: As you will recall from our earlier discussions, he hadn't been a friend in
                    holding up my nomination as Ambassador to China for months. However, in this
                    case I had no opposition or any real problems, as far as I recall. I did the
                    usual round of going up to Congress ahead of time and talking to the Senators.
                    They asked questions, but these were easily handled, and I had worked very hard
                    to get ready. I knew the issues. And I had a solid, bipartisan reputation and
                    credentials.</p>
                <p>I had some follow-up, written questions to respond to, but it all went very
                    smoothly. I don't recall how long it took, but it was fairly fast. Any
                    controversial questions really went quite smoothly.</p>
                <p>Senator Helms didn't cause me any problems this time around. In his case I had
                    been outspoken about Chinese behavior regarding human rights, so that probably
                    made him feel that I wouldn't roll over for the Chinese. This was one of the key
                    issues in that area.</p>
                <p>In 1992 I could have run into trouble in my deposition on Vietnam.That is always
                    an emotional issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0598" n="Page0598"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] You're talking about the Missing in Action
                        issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, the Missing in Action question. I recall that my confirmation as
                    Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs was an easy process.
                    Certainly, there was a very enthusiastic response to my confirmation statement.
                    I think that some of the Senators actually read the statement!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] Did you have any problem with human rights being
                        listed in tenth place among the objectives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No. I could have put human rights in fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, or
                    eighth place, instead of tenth place. However, I made it clear that in a way I
                    was giving human rights more prominence by saying that this underlined a lot of
                    what we were doing. It certainly didn't mean that it was in tenth place in order
                    of importance. I made it clear that these objectives were not meant to be read
                    in numerical order. It is true that I made sure that Japan was in first place.
                    However, I listed the bilateral objectives and then moved to the multilateral
                    objectives, in both economic and security terms. Then I moved to the new, global
                    issues. I really felt strongly about putting values and democracy in last place.
                    I put it in last place to emphasize it, rather than listing it in sixth or
                    seventh place.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] I thought that we might turn now to the atmospherics of the Clinton
                    administration. When you first arrived on board as Assistant Secretary, how did
                    you feel that this administration was going to shape up, in comparison with the
                    temperature of other administrations? Could you discuss how you assembled your
                    team? Then we can approach other issues in thematic or other form.</p>
                <p>LORD: Any new administration taking over the White House, particularly if it is
                    from a different political party, is going to experience a certain degree of
                    elbowing, confusion, anxieties, ambiguities, settling down, to-ing and fro-ing,
                    and so on. In the case of the Clinton administration I didn't feel that there
                    was an excessive amount of this. Clearly, the emphasis of President Clinton in
                    the early months, as I knew it would and should be, was on domestic issues.
                    However, there was an initial period of reflecting on our policies and seeing
                    whether we should move in any new directions.</p>
                <p>One thing that I was very conscious of was that we had some lucky breaks on the
                    calendar, in terms of my effort to get Asia and the Pacific area firmly up there
                    on the agenda. As I said in my confirmation statement, there were two events
                    coming up which I felt we could use for that purpose. It was the luck of the
                    calendar.</p>
                <pb facs="0599" n="Page0599"/>
                <p>The first event was the annual G-7 meeting, a meeting of industrial democracies.
                    By luck, in 1993 this meeting was going to take place in Asia, in Tokyo. It was
                    one out of seven chances that that would happen. Therefore, President Clinton
                    was committed to go to Asia in July, 1993. I knew that in advance and knew that
                    we could build on that. I'll get back to that in a minute. It turned out that
                    that was his first, overseas trip as President. He had been to Canada before
                    that but he had never been overseas anywhere else as President. So his first
                    trip was to the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
                <p>We didn't want to press our luck and schedule a long trip involving a number of
                    countries. But after Japan President Clinton went to South Korea as well. That
                    was one strategy that we used. South Korea was our second most important
                    regional ally and a major security challenge, with American troops, etc. It was
                    also second, after Japan, in my Senate statement.</p>
                <p>We'll get back to this trip, but in Japan President Clinton laid out the Pacific
                    Community concept that I had first mentioned in my confirmation statement. Then,
                    in addition to the bilateral aspects of the trip to Japan, there was the G-7
                    aspect. He gave a major speech which essentially set out our economic strategy
                    for Asia for the next four years. We also purposely arranged for President
                    Clinton to give a speech in South Korea, which embodied our security strategy
                    for the region for the next four years. He went to the DMZ [Demilitarized Zone]
                    and met with American troops. In both speeches we introduced the themes of
                    promoting freedom and democracy. We used the concepts of prosperity, security,
                    and freedom as catch words. We added global issues as we went along in the
                    administration. We got our conceptual approach across early with these two
                    major, blueprint speeches. So this involved the President's going to Asia and
                    giving major speeches, hitting economic themes in Japan and security aspects in
                    South Korea. All of that was very useful and helpful.</p>
                <p>The other break that we had on the calendar was the fact that, as a member of
                    APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Conference], we were the host country for this
                    meeting, which rotated each year among the various member countries. I believe
                    that at that point there were 17 or 18 members of APEC. Additional members were
                    added since then. As luck would have it, we were the host in Seattle for the
                    APEC meeting in November, 1993.</p>
                <p>I want to be clear here that I had not immediately decided to push for lifting
                    APEC from the Foreign Minister to the heads of government level. Since APEC was
                    established in 1989, the various delegations always had been headed by the
                    Foreign Ministers of the member countries. I knew that we could use this
                    gathering of all of the countries of the Pacific Region as another way to
                    advance our agenda. The APEC meetings had been held at the Foreign Minister,
                    Trade Minister, and Finance Minister level. After our first few months in office
                    I became convinced that we should raise it to the heads of government level, as
                    the first ever summit meeting of Pacific countries. This was a dramatic
                    departure which underlined to the world and to the American audience the
                    importance of Asia.</p>
                <pb facs="0600" n="Page0600"/>
                <p>Finally, I had in mind the regional security dialogues complementing the regional
                    economic dialogues in APEC. I knew that these would begin first at my level,
                    involving senior officials in the spring of 1993. Then, in July, 1993, these
                    dialogues would be at the Foreign Minister level, where there would be a meeting
                    with ASEAN representatives. These would include both meeting with them generally
                    but also talking about security problems, in an effort to energize that
                    process.</p>
                <p>Therefore, what I had in mind more generally was that if there were a leaders'
                    meeting of APEC every year and there were these regional security dialogues at
                    the Foreign Ministers' level, this meant that in every year, in our
                    administration, as well as in future ones, the President of the United States
                    would be expected to go to the Pacific area, although sometimes he would go to
                    Canada or Mexico, as APEC grew. However, on the whole the President would have
                    to go to Asia just about every year, just as he has to go to Europe for reasons
                    in our historical past. And the Secretary of State would have to go with the
                    President for an APEC meeting. That would be one trip, and the Secretary would
                    also have to go to Asia for these regional security dialogues and the ASEAN
                    meetings. So that would be another trip.</p>
                <p>This would mean that our Secretary of State would be locked in to at least two
                    trips to Asia annually. The President would be locked in to at least one such
                    trip every year. Given the way the U.S. Government works, as you know, it's not
                    just the trip in itself but the process leading up to a trip involving the
                    Secretary of State or the President. In preparing for such a trip the government
                    bureaucracy focuses on the problems of the region. The imminence of deadlines
                    concentrates the minds of officials wonderfully in terms of getting decisions
                    out of the bureaucracy, working with other countries in pushing issues forward,
                    and getting so-called deliverables and outcomes, pressing the institutions to
                    function in terms of regional economic or regional security problems. So there
                    is a whole process of getting ready for such trips and making them
                    productive.</p>
                <p>Finally, of course, you can tell the White House, in the case of the President,
                    and the Secretary of State, as foreign minister, that he or she is going to be
                    out in Asia anyway, and might just as well stop off in a couple of other places
                    as well. So, therefore, you tack on other stops for the President and the
                    Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>One other element in getting Asia prominently in view in terms of getting the
                    Administration on board very early was to stress the bipartisan support for our
                    alliances and military presence. We were maintaining our military force levels
                    in Asia at roughly 100,000 troops, which was then about the same level as in
                    Europe, as we reduced force levels there. We do this to maintain our stabilizing
                    and security presence, underlining our engagement in the region, together with
                    reinforcing and reaffirming our alliances. Throughout my tenure as Assistant
                    Secretary, I never once got a question or complaint from the Congress about our
                    commitments and our force levels in the region.</p>
                <pb facs="0601" n="Page0601"/>
                <p>So, there was my confirmation statement, lifting APEC to the national leaders'
                    level, elevating the importance of the regional security dialogue, and using
                    President Clinton's first trip overseas as chief executive to lay out themes
                    reinforcing our alliances and foreign military presence. In all of these ways I
                    thought that during the early months of the Clinton administration we could
                    place the Asia-Pacific region up there among our key interests, along with
                    Europe, in terms of world perceptions, attention, knowledge, and involvement of
                    the President and our top, cabinet level leaders in the region. This underlined
                    to the American people, media, and Congress the importance of this area.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] Did you run across any problems in this connection? I was thinking
                    in particular of the early years of the Reagan and other administrations where,
                    you might say, there was a kind of court around the President. There was the
                    President's Chief of Staff and the Special Assistants and all of that who tend
                    to resent anybody from outside getting any control over the President's
                    calendar, time, and agenda. They usually look for political opportunities to
                    serve domestic purposes. It sounds as if you didn't have that particular
                    problem.</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, first of all, I don't want to inflate my own importance in this
                    context. I'm just saying how I approached these problems. Obviously, I had to
                    work through the Secretary of State, my associates in the NSC [National Security
                    Council] context, and the various economic agencies. Usually, they were very
                    receptive in terms of my view of the importance of these interests. The reason
                    that I said the President's calendar was so important is that you can't expect
                    any President to lay on trips to Asia, which is far away, on his own initiative.
                    It's different from going to Mexico or Canada, or even Europe. You can't
                    casually commit the President to a trip to Asia during the first few months that
                    he is in office.</p>
                <p>This was all the more the case since President Clinton was determined to focus on
                    domestic issues, above all. So that's why we were very lucky that the G-7
                    meeting was scheduled in Tokyo, and the President had to attend it. Also, it's a
                    matter of human nature. He is a very engaged kind of guy when he gets interested
                    in something. Once you get a President involved in something, it is important.
                    He meets the personalities involved, and they form personal relationships. He
                    gets into the issues by reading briefing books and participating in the
                    meetings. Then you have a President hooked for the rest of his
                    administration.</p>
                <p>So we were very lucky. It wasn't a matter of having convinced the White House
                    that the President should make a trip to Asia, which would have been a tough
                    sell that early in the Clinton administration. This was his first trip abroad as
                    President, as I said. In fact, he had to attend the G-7 meeting in Tokyo. For
                    the decision to raise the level of the APEC meeting, we got a lot of help from
                    Paul Keating, the Prime Minister of Australia, who was very enthusiastic about
                    APEC. He was a big mover and shaker and one of the organizers of APEC.</p>
                <pb facs="0602" n="Page0602"/>
                <p>During the summer of 1993, we were debating in the government and trying to
                    promote a meeting of heads of government in Asia-Pacific to be held in November,
                    so there wasn't much lead time. Paul Keating visited the United States, met with
                    President Clinton, and pushed him hard on this meeting. He deserves a lot of
                    credit, although I think that we would have been able to persuade the President
                    to attend this meeting anyway. He helped us to convince the White House that
                    this was a good idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Bernhardt] Where did this idea of raising the level
                        oparticipation in APEC originate? Was it with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No. I think that it originated with some people outside the U.S.
                    Government. Fred Bergsten was very helpful, working with us on the APEC meeting.
                    He probably floated the idea of raising the level of the meeting, although I
                    don't recall precisely. I certainly had the idea, but many others had it, too. I
                    can't pretend that this was a brilliant idea that only I thought of. The
                    Australians had floated it. It just seemed to me that this was a terrific way to
                    highlight the Asian region, to get President Clinton engaged in it, and to start
                    a process of Pacific leaders meetings, as European and Atlantic leaders had been
                    meeting for decades already. They were in constant touch and were talking about
                    issues that they had in common. I thought that this was a good way to build a
                    Pacific Community which was in our interest, even as we maintained our bilateral
                    foundations. Those meetings would also be a good umbrella for a series of
                    bilateral meetings at the site of the conference - just like the United Nations
                    General Assembly in the fall. Indeed President Clinton was able, for example, to
                    have regular meetings with Chinese President Jiang before he was able to visit
                    China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] And Secretary of State Warren Christopher was
                        principal player.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, he was receptive to it. Again, in terms of elevating the level of
                    APEC, this all came to a head in about June or July, 1993. It was not pushed
                    earlier than that, and even we didn't push it right away. There was some debate
                    about it. However, the more we considered it, the more we thought that it was a
                    very good idea. Secretary Christopher was certainly supportive of it. I don't
                    recall that there was any particular controversy over it. I think that the
                    economic agencies also liked the idea because Asia was such an important part of
                    our economic interests. If there was any resistance to this, and I don't say
                    this critically, it would have been from the people who schedule the President's
                    program in the White House. We'll get back to that later on.</p>
                <p>As I say, regarding the Asian trip, I don't recall any particular problem. Not
                    only was it easy to persuade the President to go to Japan, but it was quite easy
                    to persuade him to go to South Korea as well, since he would already be out
                    there in the Western Pacific, anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0603" n="Page0603"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] Before we get to these trips, can you talk
                        abouassembling your staff in the Bureau of East Asian Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Sure. Generally, my approach here was that the most crucial part of the job
                    was the people I had working for me. When I worked as Special Assistant to
                    Kissinger, I operated pretty much on my own. However, in connection with every
                    job I've had since then, whether it was the Policy Planning Staff, the Council
                    on Foreign Relations, the Embassy in Beijing, or this job as Assistant Secretary
                    of State, I believe that my strength was magnified whenever I could get good
                    people.</p>
                <p>I think that I have certain qualities myself but I don't think that I am so grand
                    that I could handle these jobs entirely on my own. I've always thought that I
                    needed good people and that I'm relatively good at leading a team. I believe in
                    picking the best people, giving them responsibility, and holding them
                    accountable. So I put a lot of emphasis on this, as I'm sure that any Assistant
                    Secretary would emphasize recruitment of qualified staff. Of course, you inherit
                    a group of people, and in the State Department you can't do much in terms of
                    great changes at the Country Director level or below. It's really at the Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary level that you can make a difference, but I won't go on at
                    any great length in this regard. I reached back to my Deputy Chief of Mission
                    from the Embassy in Beijing, Peter Tomsen, to be my principal Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary. He had tremendous experience, not only in China, but in Russia,
                    Vietnam, and India. So he brought a general perspective on Asia, and I thought
                    that his geopolitical feel was really very good.</p>
                <p>I was very conscious of the fact that, given my identification with China and
                    that of Tomsen, I needed a very strong Japanese specialist on my staff. So I
                    asked around very carefully and settled on Tom Hubbard. He handled Japan and
                    Korea. One Deputy Assistant Secretary whom I held over from my predecessor was
                    Ken Quinn for Southeast Asia. This didn't mean that the others weren't good, but
                    I very much wanted to keep him on my team. I kept Ken Quinn and a woman named
                    Sandy Kristoff, who was Deputy Assistant Secretary for East Asian Economic
                    Affairs. Then she was stolen from me by the NSC a few months later.
                    Subsequently, I recruited another woman named Sandra O'Leary, who was the person
                    I considered best qualified for this job, male or female, though I very much
                    wanted at least one woman among my deputies. I always put quality first but I
                    was determined to have a woman in this position, if at all possible. The first
                    Special Assistant that I chose was another woman, Patricia Scroggs.</p>
                <p>On personnel choices I pushed the issue of appointing women and minorities to the
                    Bureau very strongly. This had been a conviction of mine for some time. My
                    mother was a strong woman, my wife is a strong woman, and I felt very strongly
                    on this issue, as a matter of equity. I made a major effort for several years on
                    personnel issues to improve the participation of women and minorities at senior
                    levels of the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0604" n="Page0604"/>
                <p>I did less well in getting African-Americans than women. I did well in appointing
                    Asian-Americans, but not too well on appointing African-Americans. There just
                    weren't that many qualified African-Americans in the Foreign Service. At least
                    there weren't that many qualified people who were interested in Asia. My efforts
                    in that regard were less successful, although they were very successful in terms
                    of women. I made it very clear that quality and excellence came first, but we
                    had to expand our net, try to find suitable women and minorities, and then pick
                    the best person. The odds would be better and we would get more women and
                    minorities if we actively sought to recruit them. EA/P [Bureau of East Asian and
                    Pacific Affairs] did not have a particularly good reputation in this area. I
                    worked very hard to improve it, with considerable success.</p>
                <p>I had my Special Assistant, Patricia Scroggs, conduct a comprehensive campaign to
                    contact women and minorities, including those at overseas posts and in the
                    Department, and try to get them interested in serving in EA/P. I kept pressing
                    our Country Directors as they were recruiting people for the country desks to
                    make sure that there were women and minorities on their lists. I always made
                    clear that I wasn't going to sacrifice excellence or apply quotas. However, I
                    also made clear that I wanted the number of women and minorities to go up both
                    in recruiting and in providing a more receptive atmosphere in EA/P in which they
                    would want to work. I think that we built up some momentum in this regard and
                    got a reputation for doing better than the bureau had done in the past. This
                    applied, not only in Washington, but also in our senior positions overseas.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] Talking about minorities, what was your impression of the
                    recruitment to positions in EA/P of Asian-Americans? Would you say that they
                    were sort of coming on stream?</p>
                <p>LORD: I think that by definition we had more Asian-Americans in our Bureau than
                    in any other Bureau. There was a lot of interest among Asian-Americans in our
                    bureau, and we had a lot of them there. I considered that as part of the
                    minority mix as well. That was a fairly easy objective to achieve. Even when I
                    came into the bureau, I noticed that we had quite a few Asian-Americans. The
                    real problem and challenge was and remains the recruitment of African-Americans.
                    The bureau and the Foreign Service in general have done much better in the
                    recruitment of women. However, we're still lacking in terms of
                    African-Americans. Nevertheless, I attached a high priority to this, and the
                    powers that be in the Department of State recognized and appreciated that.</p>
                <p>Could I mention a few other, generic issues which might be helpful to you? I'm
                    talking now over a period of several years. First, and I'll get back to these, I
                    went on all of the Presidential and Secretary of State Asian trips overseas
                    during my tenure as Assistant Secretary. I traveled with the Secretary of
                    Defense to China, Japan, and Korea. I went semi-clandestinely with the Director
                    of CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] to China. I went with the NSC Advisors on a
                    couple of Asian trips. In each of these cases I was the top adviser to the
                    principal representative.</p>
                <pb facs="0605" n="Page0605"/>
                <p>I don't have the numbers, but in my own personal travels I went to Japan the
                    most. I made it clear, particularly early on during my service as Assistant
                    Secretary, especially with my China background, that Japan was our number one
                    partner in East Asia. Japan was the first place that I visited on my own, as I
                    recall, and certainly this was very early on in my term as Assistant Secretary.
                    Almost every time I went to Asia, I would try to go to Japan. I would always
                    seek Japanese officials out at meetings of senior officials on regional
                    security, around the edges of the UN, and so forth. I would try to show that I
                    wanted to consult and concert with them as much as I could on the various issues
                    in Asia under consideration.</p>
                <p>On my own trips, and when I traveled with the President and the Secretary of
                    State, I must have visited Japan about 15 or 20 times during this period. I
                    would say that I visited South Korea at least 10 times; China, six times; Hong
                    Kong several times; ASEAN countries probably varied from Brunei, twice, to
                    Thailand, about eight times, with the other countries more or less in between
                    and closer to the level of trips to Thailand. I visited Vietnam roughly six
                    times; Cambodia, roughly four times; Australia, maybe four times; New Zealand,
                    maybe three times; and the South Pacific, maybe three times. I went to Europe
                    several times and to Russia twice for consultations on Asia. I thought that
                    these trips were important in pushing our interests and for all of the other
                    reasons I have mentioned.</p>
                <p>I also gave high priority to dealing with the press. To be honest about it, I got
                    to be fairly good at it. Mike McCurry [White House press spokesperson] would
                    have me go out after Presidential meetings, sometimes by myself, and sometimes
                    with White House people. It was fairly unusual for White House people to let a
                    State Department official handle this. Such meetings with the press were often
                    on a background basis but sometimes on the record, especially in terms of
                    Presidential meetings and always in the case of State Department meetings. I
                    would often be brought down by the State Department press spokesperson, first
                    Mike McCurry and then Nick Burns, to give special briefings at the State
                    Department. I did a lot of press contact work on the telephone and gave a lot of
                    backgrounders to the press.</p>
                <p>I did a lot of work with the foreign press, not only on the phone, but also at
                    the Foreign Press Center in the Department of State. I had more appearances by
                    far on USIA's WorldNet than any other Assistant Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] Can you explain what WorldNet was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: WorldNet is a USIA [United States Information Agency] operation where we
                    televised live interaction with people of other countries. I would often be on
                    these programs, which would concern three or four countries, with audience
                    participation, questions, and so on. Or I would discuss major, upcoming trips
                    and try to set the scenes for them.</p>
                <pb facs="0606" n="Page0606"/>
                <p>I believed that dealing with the press was important in terms of getting our
                    policy themes out. These events were either on the record or on background. I
                    have to say that my general view is that the press quality and coverage is way
                    down now, compared to my days in the 1970s. In the 1970s the quality of the
                    journalists traveling with Secretary Kissinger was extraordinary. Some of their
                    names would be more familiar than others, but they included people like Ted
                    Koppel, Strobe Talbot, Bernie Gwertzman, Murray Marder, the Kalb brothers, and
                    other people who were outstanding. In the 1970s, when I talked to them
                    seriously, I felt that I had a better response than in the 1990s where it was a
                    mixed bag. On foreign policy issues, there tended to be a certain attitude among
                    journalists of gotcha and confrontations. So therefore, although I had some
                    impact when dealing with the press, many times I felt frustrated. I would give
                    them what I thought was a great rationale, a conceptual approach, and all of the
                    pluses of our policy, but some of the journalists would only pick out the
                    negative aspects. They would think that I was spinning and emphasizing those
                    areas of advantage to the government, while I would think that I was being
                    educational. Of course, I was spinning as well! But whether it was a particular
                    issue on the results of a meeting or trip, the press often seemed to be
                    searching for the bad news.</p>
                <p>I did a lot with the press overseas, too. Every time I went to a country, I would
                    have a press conference with local and foreign press representatives, as well as
                    with American journalists and international observers. That was important. You
                    get a lot more coverage from the overseas press than you do from the American
                    press. If you have a press conference in Singapore, South Korea, or Japan, it's
                    a much bigger deal than when you have a press conference in the United States.
                    The foreign press really covers a press conference. So I would do that
                    religiously. I would also work on background with foreign and American
                    media.</p>
                <p>I'm still talking about generic activities as Assistant Secretary. Congress was
                    extremely important. I testified before Congress often. I always did my homework
                    and was comfortable doing this. I was very fortunate in that the two
                    Congressional Subcommittees on East Asia (Senate and House) which I dealt with
                    the most were headed by very responsible people. I thought that most of the time
                    that I was up there they were there to learn and wanted to have an exchange of
                    views and hear what I had to say, rather than trying to embarrass me and put me
                    on the spot. Now, there were some controversial questions such as on Vietnam and
                    the Missing in Action question, which were exciting. Other examples included the
                    proposed visit of Taiwan's President Lee or the U.S. policy of strategic
                    ambiguity in the Taiwan Straits. On the whole, my colleagues and I worked very
                    closely with the members of these sub-committees. I would go up to Congress to
                    keep specific members of the sub-committees or elsewhere informed, particularly
                    on trips that were coming up. Then either my superiors or I would debrief them
                    when we would come back to Washington. So we would keep in touch on key
                    issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0607" n="Page0607"/>
                <p>The classic example was Vietnam, where I dealt a great deal with Senator McCain
                    [Republican, Arizona], Senator John Kerry [Democrat, Massachusetts], and Senator
                    Bob Kerrey [Democrat, Nebraska], as well as Congressman Pete Peterson [Florida].
                    Senator McCain was very important on this issue as a former POW [Prisoner of
                    War] himself. He and the others I mentioned gave the President political cover
                    in normalizing relations with Vietnam. We coordinated very closely for several
                    years on the gradual normalization with Vietnam.</p>
                <p>I paid a lot of attention to think tanks, whether it was my own Council on
                    Foreign Relations, the Asia Society, or some of the conservative think tanks,
                    such as the Heritage Foundation in Washington. I also spoke often outside of New
                    York, including on the West Coast. While in the cities, I would meet with the
                    media as well. I would try to keep in touch with outside experts and hold
                    meetings with them, either individually or as a group, and get their views. I
                    also tried to build support for our policies. I gave quite a few speeches, an
                    example of a major one being the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco.</p>
                <p>I also thought that it was important to get the views of outside groups and also
                    to build support among other groups. I met regularly and separately with
                    business representatives, usually the representatives of companies in Washington
                    of the business community. Whenever I traveled abroad I also met with American
                    business groups to explain our policies and, most importantly, to hear how we
                    could help them with local governments. I would make a few remarks to outline a
                    few, key issues and ask for their views.I also met with representatives of human
                    rights groups. I think that I was the only Assistant Secretary of State who did
                    this, except for John Shattuck, who was the Assistant Secretary for Human Rights
                    in general. I met with the leaders of human rights groups every few months to
                    get their views. I definitely wanted to get their perspectives and ideas but I
                    also wanted to maintain support for our policies.</p>
                <p>I was very fortunate in the interagency dealings we had. The most crucial was
                    with the NSC, where I had worked in the Kissinger days, when NSC-State
                    coordination was less than ideal! I was very fortunate first that I had actually
                    recommended to Tony Lake [then National Security Adviser to President Clinton]
                    that he recruit Kent Weideman as his Asian NSC person. Kent had been my Economic
                    Counselor in Beijing and then was DCM [Deputy Chief of Mission] in Israel. He
                    had also been DCM in Singapore. So I worked, first with him and then with his
                    replacement, Stan Roth, and had extremely good relations with them. I was
                    enthusiastic about Kent and then about Stan. These were good people over in the
                    NSC, but they were also people that I could deal with. It was very important
                    that we had tremendous cooperation with the NSC, even to the point where we
                    would show them drafts of memos that we were writing in our own building to get
                    ideas and make sure that we coordinated with each other as much as possible.
                    They would do the same with us. We never had major disagreements with them. We
                    had healthy debates, but always cordial and collegial. After Roth came Sandy
                    Kristoff with whom relations were also good, but she was less open.</p>
                <pb facs="0608" n="Page0608"/>
                <p>The same excellent ties were true of the Department of Defense, particularly with
                    Joe Nye [Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs] and
                    Kurt Campbell, his deputy. We were able to work extremely well with the Defense
                    Department. We had weekly meetings with the key, security related bureaus in the
                    State Department, the intelligence people, and the key counterparts in the
                    Pentagon and NSC. We discussed regional security issues. This was a very useful
                    mechanism which my predecessors had used. I instituted a new similar mechanism
                    on economic issues. This was not as productive as the meetings on security
                    issues, but still was helpful.</p>
                <p>I was very conscious of our overseas links, including keeping in touch with our
                    Ambassadors. I would send occasional, conceptual messages to all of our overseas
                    posts, outlining our policies and reviewing major issues. I was very concerned
                    to make sure that our Embassies were well informed and I stressed the importance
                    of this to our country desks. I was in touch with our Ambassadors personally, as
                    were my deputies, on their personnel concerns, as well as substantively.</p>
                <p>We had only one Chiefs of Mission meeting while I was in office as Assistant
                    Secretary, due to budgetary reasons. In 1994 we had a Chiefs of Mission meeting,
                    when we were having some problems with some aspects of our Asia policy. I
                    thought that it was very important to air different people's views, do some
                    course corrections, and generally get our policies on a better track. So the
                    Chiefs of Mission meeting of 1994 was about as good, important, and productive a
                    meeting of this kind as I've ever participated in. Together with a memo I wrote
                    to the Secretary that spring (which was leaked by someone to the press and
                    became famous), this meeting resulted in significant changes in style, even
                    substance, over succeeding months, which really helped in the region.</p>
                <p>In Washington I had regular staff meetings. I emphasized having younger people
                    sit in on meetings with foreign Ambassadors and other meetings, so that it was
                    not just the Country Directors that were involved. I made it clear that I wanted
                    to see as many of the younger people as possible, both to add to their
                    experience and for morale purposes in general. I would also try to get their
                    views. I already mentioned my emphasis on women.</p>
                <p>I spent a lot of time on personnel matters every year, working with our Deputy
                    Assistant Secretaries and Country Directors to get the best people in the
                    bureau, and not just to get diversity, but also quality. Getting the best people
                    for our overseas posts and in Washington was a very high priority for me. I had
                    regular, brown bag lunches with junior and medium level officers whom I would
                    not normally see as much of as some of the others. I had occasional meetings
                    with women and minority officers to talk about issues that they were concerned
                    about.</p>
                <pb facs="0609" n="Page0609"/>
                <p>When I would read a particularly good memorandum or cable, I would send the
                    drafting officer a message complimenting him or her. The same with cables from
                    abroad. I also asked my Special Assistant and Secretary to keep me posted on
                    personnel matters, such as whether someone was having a baby, a death in the
                    family, or whatever it was, so that I could be in touch that way. I tried to
                    find ways to give a feeling to people in a large bureau that there was some
                    interaction with the top levels in the office. I also spent a great deal of time
                    on efficiency reports - a process I hated but knew was important to officers'
                    careers and morale.</p>
                <p>So those are some of the generic approaches that I used. I hope that I don't
                    sound too self-serving. I'm just trying to describe elements I considered
                    important in doing the job.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] You mentioned meetings with the Pentagon. Did you find, at least
                    initially, a certain wariness on the part of the Pentagon, particularly in terms
                    of the uniformed people? President Clinton had not served in the military. He
                    had brought with him, particularly in the White House, some younger, political
                    types or some bumptious, younger people who reportedly looked down on the
                    military. I was wondering whether that attitude spilled over to your contacts
                    with the Pentagon, because you had important, political concerns in some,
                    specific areas.</p>
                <p>LORD: That's a very fair question. The President had evaded the draft during the
                    Vietnam War. He had been against the war. One of his first issues with the
                    military concerned the issue of gays serving in the military. The Clinton people
                    were less identified with strong, military policies than was the case during the
                    Reagan administration, and so on. Therefore, there undoubtedly was some unease
                    in the military when Clinton came into office. To his credit, I think, he
                    overcame that initial feeling to a certain extent. But he got off to a poor
                    start, to say the least.</p>
                <p>Having said that and knowing that some negative feelings about Clinton existed
                    generally in the services, I did not find that this kind of criticism popped up
                    in my context. In the first place, I don't think that unless you know somebody
                    particularly well, and particularly if he or she is a political appointee, they
                    aren't going to criticize the White House. You wouldn't expect that to
                    happen.</p>
                <p>The fact is that I'm sure that there was some unease about some of the policies
                    of the Clinton administration. However, the crucial issue in my region, about
                    maintaining our force levels in the region, was never debated or discussed in
                    the bureau or at higher levels. There was a consensus that the level of military
                    troops stationed in the region played a key role in our foreign policy. No one
                    made the kind of mistake that President Carter made in talking about pulling our
                    troops out of South Korea.</p>
                <pb facs="0610" n="Page0610"/>
                <p>Personally, I had excellent relations with the military as well as Pentagon
                    civilians. Overseas, I worked especially closely with CINCPAC. The first one I
                    overlapped with was Admiral Larson, and he was superb, one of the best officers
                    I've dealt with. His various activities - military exchanges, military
                    assistance, ship visits, exercises, tours of the region, etc. - were very
                    helpful to our goals. Toward the end of my tour, Admiral Prueher also was
                    outstanding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] I was in Seoul when President Carter entered
                        office.That was a major issue at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: It was, and I've yet to find anybody who was responsible for that policy.
                    People tend to say: “Oh, no, I didn't recommend that.”I will say that on
                    regional security dialogues, and I kept emphasizing this, we were maintaining
                    our alliances and our military presence, which were crucial to our security.
                    These dialogues were just something that we were trying to build on top of that.
                    Maybe, decades from now, we may be able to shift some of the responsibilities
                    and turn some of these institutions into real security forums. Maybe they will
                    be effective. However, as far ahead as we can see, we are going to need our
                    troops and our alliances. I kept stressing that.</p>
                <p>However, having said that, I found that there was less enthusiasm in the Pentagon
                    generally for the regional security dialogues than there was in the State
                    Department. There was no outright opposition to them. A lot of the reason for
                    this lack of enthusiasm for the dialogues is that it was mostly State Department
                    and NSC people doing the talking at these meetings, and not Department of
                    Defense officials. I pushed to have military representatives sitting in on these
                    meetings as well and had some success in that regard. It was somewhat slow
                    going, and we'll get back to this. However, there was some feeling that although
                    this might be a noble objective, the Defense Department people didn't think that
                    they were all that crucial. However, it wasn't a major issue.</p>
                <p>President Clinton strongly supported maintaining our military presence in East
                    Asia. As I said before, he visited South Korea early on in his first term as
                    President. I don't recall any real problem coming up in this regard.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] Would you like to talk about the two, major meetings? First, there
                    was the trip which President Clinton made to Japan and to South Korea. Then we
                    might move over to the Seattle meeting of APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic
                    Conference]. Perhaps we could begin with a brief, overview of the situation and
                    problems during the four years of the first Clinton term. Then we could hit each
                    country and problem separately.</p>
                <pb facs="0611" n="Page0611"/>
                <p>LORD: Right. We're talking about both reality and perception of how we were doing
                    in Asia and in the Pacific during this time. When we had some of our biggest
                    problems, I think that you could say that our Asian problems were like what Mark
                    Twain said about Wagner's music: “It's not as bad as it sounds.”</p>
                <p>I think that it's fair to say that we got off to an early and good start.
                    Although there was some friction right away with Japan on trade, we took
                    advantage of the calendar that we discussed, including the President's trip to
                    Asia. Generally, during President Clinton's Asia trip, he set out broad themes
                    in Japan and South Korea on economics, security, and human rights/democracy.</p>
                <p>My Senate confirmation statement was of use in my early dealings with other
                    countries. I went on an early trip to several countries in East Asia in May,
                    1993, before the President went on his trip to the area and began moving on
                    regional dialogues. I negotiated with the Congress, on behalf of the President,
                    MFN [Most Favored Nation] extension for China. At the time, and people tend to
                    forget this, this was greeted as a very positive outcome. Although the President
                    had been very harsh on China during the campaign and many in Congress wanted
                    very tough conditions or to cut off MFN altogether, the human rights conditions
                    we negotiated were modest. They put some pressure on the Chinese, but they
                    weren't so onerous that the Chinese couldn't meet them, and thus we wouldn't
                    lose MFN extension as a result. In any event, I worked well with Congresswoman
                    Pelosi [Democrat, California] and Senator Mitchell [Democrat, Maine] on this
                    issue. There was disappointment from the beginning with the economic people in
                    the administration, who didn't want any conditions. Later they sabotaged the
                    President's policy. But at the time (June 1993), the MFN deal was greeted as a
                    success.</p>
                <p>Then, by the end of 1993 we had the very successful meeting in Seattle of APEC.
                    There was the drama of the first meeting ever of the leaders of the various,
                    participating countries and setting forth provisions for greater trade and
                    investment in the Pacific. This was part of a triple play on trade. Just before
                    President Clinton arrived in Seattle, NAFTA was approved by the U.S. Congress.
                    And soon after Seattle there was a breakthrough on global negotiations in the
                    Uruguay Round of GATT.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] That's the North American Free Trade Agreement
                        witMexico and Canada.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's right. President Clinton arrived at the APEC meeting, having just
                    won a major victory on NAFTA, with the help of the Republicans, I might add.
                    This was accomplished literally one day before he arrived in Seattle. If he had
                    lost this agreement, it would have hurt everything. So the President came in on
                    the wave of a major success. This gave an impetus to the whole APEC meeting, of
                    course.</p>
                <pb facs="0612" n="Page0612"/>
                <p>Then the bold vision set forth by the APEC leaders in turn directed the attention
                    of the Europeans to the Uruguay Round of tariff and trade negotiations. The
                    Europeans had been dragging their feet on the Uruguay Round. Then the Europeans
                    began to see in APEC that the U.S. and Asia might get together at Europe's
                    expense, and they began moving on the Uruguay Round. Within a couple of months,
                    therefore, we had major breakthroughs on NAFTA, on APEC, and on the Uruguay
                    Round in GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] negotiations.</p>
                <p>When you put all of that together - the MFN deal on China, the President's Asia
                    trip, APEC, etc. - things looked as if they were going pretty well in the
                    Asia-Pacific region in 1993. We did have trade problems with Japan. However, on
                    the whole, things looked pretty good at that time.</p>
                <p>During the latter months of 1993 therefore I was getting a good press, and people
                    were generally supportive of our initiatives. I might add at this point that
                    Secretary of State Christopher decided that Cliff Wharton wouldn't work out as
                    new Deputy Secretary. So Christopher was looking for a Deputy Secretary. I'm
                    just giving you the general rhythm of the administration, but it reflected the
                    fact that Christopher and the White House were happy about how things were going
                    in Asia at that point.</p>
                <p>As I say, at the end of 1993 Secretary Christopher was looking for a Deputy. I
                    know for a fact that the choice came down to Strobe Talbot or myself. Indeed, at
                    one point Elaine Sciolino from the “New York Times” called me and said that the
                    “Times” was going to run an article on the following day, saying that I had been
                    chosen to be Deputy Secretary of State. I said: “Well, you know something that I
                    don't know,” and I steered her away from that. This was just as well, as the
                    story was not accurate.</p>
                <p>One semi-amusing comment here. I was told by someone very close to Secretary
                    Christopher that the choice was between Talbot and myself and over the following
                    weekend Christopher was reportedly going to choose between Talbot and myself.
                    One thing that he doesn't do, unless it involves a crisis, is that he doesn't
                    bother you on weekends. He's not like Kissinger, who might go out of his way to
                    contact you on weekends, if he possibly could. It was very unusual for
                    Christopher to call you on weekends. He might call you on Saturday morning, if
                    you're in the office or he sees you. Otherwise, you don't generally get a call
                    from Christopher over the weekend. He would say to himself: “This can wait till
                    Monday.”</p>
                <p>So I went into the weekend, knowing that the choice was probably between Talbot
                    and me and against this background of Christopher's habit of never calling on
                    weekends. At about 6:00 or 7:00 PM on Sunday night a call came through that
                    Secretary of State Christopher was calling me. So I sort of looked at my watch
                    and thought that I might be asked to be Deputy Secretary at about 6:50 PM on
                    such and such a date.</p>
                <pb facs="0613" n="Page0613"/>
                <p>What Christopher discussed with me was some press report on China. It was not all
                    that important or urgent and could have waited until the next morning. We
                    discussed this report for about ten minutes. I kept waiting for the other shoe
                    to drop. Not only did I know that he was making up his mind on his deputy but I
                    also knew that he knew that I knew! So here we had this ten minute conversation
                    about some relatively modest issue about China. He got to the end of it, said:
                    “Thank you,” and hung up. I was totally puzzled. In any event, I found later
                    that Christopher had chosen Strobe Talbot instead of me. He called me finally in
                    Vail, Colorado.</p>
                <p>Frankly, and this may sound amazing, I was not that disappointed. First of all, I
                    thought very highly of Strobe Talbot. I'm not just being polite for the record.
                    Secondly, I really liked what I was doing and had my teeth sunk into the job.
                    Obviously, on balance I would have preferred to have been selected as Deputy
                    Secretary of State. However, I've always had some anxiety levels as I've moved
                    up, so I had mixed feelings about the resolution of this issue.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] Well, I'm trying to get a feel about the inner workings of the
                    bureaucracy and do not want to criticize anybody. However, what was your
                    impression and the word as to why the relationship between Cliff Wharton and
                    Christopher hadn't worked out?</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, I had known Cliff Wharton as a Director of the Council on Foreign
                    Relations. He is a very able man. I think that the conventional wisdom is true,
                    in that Christopher didn't think that Wharton had all of that much experience on
                    foreign policy and that he wanted either Peter Tarnoff, Tom Pickering, or
                    somebody else as his number two man in the State Department. I think that it
                    actually was Tom Pickering's name which was floated around most often at the
                    time. However, the White House, with its laudatory goal of increasing diversity
                    in the administration, put considerable pressure on Christopher to choose
                    Wharton, who is an African-American. You'd have to ask Christopher if this is
                    true, but I got that feeling. So I don't think that Wharton was Christopher's
                    first choice to be Deputy Secretary.</p>
                <p>All of us have strengths and weaknesses. I think that Cliff had served in AID
                    [Agency for International Development], but he was not a bureaucratic jungle
                    fighter and wasn't all that decisive. I just think that Christopher needed more
                    support, and Wharton wasn't working out in the job. I think that Wharton wasn't
                    all that happy, either, as Deputy Secretary. It is a little awkward for me to
                    discuss this matter, and I think that you ought to talk to the people most
                    directly involved. I must say that Wharton is an extremely decent guy. I think
                    that Christopher needed more decisive, stronger support and that he,
                    Christopher, found that he couldn't successfully delegate key issues to him.</p>
                <pb facs="0614" n="Page0614"/>
                <p>I don't mean to digress too much on this Deputy Secretary issue. I believe that
                    if you are detached about it, strictly in terms of foreign policy resume, mine
                    was probably more impressive than Talbot's, because he had only worked for the
                    government for a year. He had done extremely well as a special representative on
                    the Soviet Union. However, he didn't have the equivalent of my experience on
                    foreign policy, although he had a very impressive resume in other ways. But he
                    had shown in one year that he was terrific on policy making and on dealing with
                    the bureaucracy, as well as on substance. Above all, he was very close to the
                    President, which I felt was valuable for Christopher. I thought that that would
                    be very helpful for Christopher in dealing with the White House and the
                    President. So I thought that on those grounds, as well as Talbot's other
                    qualities, he was a very sensible choice.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Talbot is so decent a person that he would handle his close relationship
                    with the President and serving Christopher with great skill, and he did so. In
                    short, he was an asset for Christopher in terms of the White House, but he
                    clearly never played Christopher off against the President and never used his
                    White House connection to Christopher's disadvantage. He retained enormous
                    respect from Christopher and from the President. He did an excellent job and has
                    done so ever since. He is just a great human being. I would say that off the
                    record as well as on the record.</p>
                <p>This is more or less by way of telling the good news in a general way on the
                    first year foreign policy - and my reputation - in the Clinton Administration.
                    Now I'll get to the bad news. As I said, during the first year of the Clinton
                    administration I think that people felt, and I felt also, that we were off to a
                    good start. Then we ran into some trouble, no question about it, in the first
                    few months of 1994. Several things conspired to produce this result.</p>
                <p>First, and I'll go into more detail on Japan, but what dominated the public and
                    media perception of Japan policy was trade disputes with that country. I'll get
                    into that later. Basically, the conventional wisdom or the view of the hard
                    liners in economics was that we ought to confront the Japanese on these matters.
                    But even those who were worried about the balance of payments deficit or market
                    access felt that all of this noise and dispute with Japan was dominating what
                    after all was our most important partnership. One way or another many thought we
                    were hurting relations.</p>
                <pb facs="0615" n="Page0615"/>
                <p>Secondly, at the same time, we had this reversal on MFN [Most Favored Nation]
                    status for China. We had the unfortunate trip by Secretary Christopher to China
                    in March, 1994, and then the President changed his position on MFN
                    conditionality. It is now called “Normal Trade Relations” or “NTR,” instead of
                    MFN, which is what it was called at the time. So we were embarrassed on that
                    front and weren't making a great deal of progress with China. Therefore, it
                    looked as if we weren't doing very well with China. People like Kissinger and
                    other Republicans in particular said that we weren't giving enough emphasis to
                    strategic dialogue and that we were too focused on human rights. At the same
                    time, the human rights people, including some in Congress, were unhappy that we
                    had reversed our policy on MFN. So there was considerable criticism of how we
                    were handling the China relationship.</p>
                <p>In addition, in the early months of 1994, the Korean issue heateup. The North
                    Koreans were threatening to leave the NPT.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] NPT is the Non Proliferation Treaty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. There was a lot of to-ing and fro-ing about IAEA [International Atomic
                    Energy Agency] inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities. So we had a
                    buildup of tension on the Korean front. And trouble with our two biggest
                    partners in Asia, Japan and China. You put all of this together, and there was
                    considerable criticism of our Asia policy. This became increasingly personal.
                    With respect to the MFN reversal - I'll discuss in detail later - people were
                    looking for scapegoats. Clearly, I was a likely target. I had been in favor of
                    conditional MFN extension and I had advised President Clinton to that effect. I
                    was Assistant Secretary for East Asian Affairs, including China, and so there
                    was a lot of press backgrounding and even foregrounding, particularly by the
                    representatives of our economic agencies, that I had not consulted enough with
                    them and had sort of screwed things up. There was an article in “Newsweek” with
                    my picture asking: “Is Lord about to be fired?” So this was not the happiest
                    time of my career.</p>
                <p>I obviously thought, at the time, that although we had some problems, they were
                    manageable. There was also the debate at the time about Asian values. There was
                    a conference in Vienna about Asian values versus universal values.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] Could you explain what that distinction
                        means?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0616" n="Page0616"/>
                <p>LORD: Well, people like Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia, SenioMinister Lee
                    Kuan Yew of Singapore, not to mention communist rulers, basically were saying,
                    with different nuances and degrees, that human rights are not universal. They
                    felt that there are some regional emphases that we should pay attention to. They
                    tended to say that Asians care about discipline, family, community, and
                    stability. They said that Western emphasis on liberty and freedom sometimes
                    leads to chaos, crime, and drugs, and that we shouldn't be pushing our values on
                    Asian countries. We'll get back to all of this. That had been a controversy. So
                    in early 1994 we ran into some problems and debates on that as well. That was
                    part of the mix which made it look as if we were not having a great deal of
                    success in Asia at the time.</p>
                <p>Obviously, I had my own views on this. First, I felt that you don't judge the
                    correctness of a policy only in terms of whether you are getting along with
                    another country. If there is a trade problem with Japan, it's easier to sweep it
                    under the rug and make things look as if everything is going well than
                    confronting it directly. And I'll get back to Japan in more depth. Anyway, I
                    thought that it was important to be firm with Japan. We had some problems which
                    may have reflected that we had a different style of dealing with this, but the
                    rest of the Department of State and I were firm about being tough with the
                    Japanese on that. It was not a matter of the economic agencies being tough and
                    the State Department being soft. We felt that Japan was simply being
                    unreasonable. I thought that some of the people commenting on the Japan issue
                    didn't realize that if we didn't make progress there, it could hurt our security
                    interests over the longer run. Americans and Congress at some point might zero
                    in on the continuing huge trade deficit with Japan and China and begin to link
                    it with security issues. We wanted to head that off by getting Japan to open up
                    its market.</p>
                <p>Also, I was already working with the Department of Defense and other people to
                    isolate our security interests and other involvement with Japan from the
                    economic aspects, so that we wouldn't lose them. So I felt that some of the
                    criticism of our policy wasn't realistic. You can't judge relations as excellent
                    just because everything is going smoothly. If you have a problem, it may get
                    worse if you don't address it. I believed that some temporary flak might be
                    necessary to get to a more solid relationship with Japan.</p>
                <p>On China, I think that if we had it all to do over again, we probably shouldn't
                    have had conditional MFN renewal. But we were in a box in 1993 because of the
                    President's campaign positions. I also think that it might have worked. I think
                    that in 1993 we got the best possible outcome, given the President's campaign
                    rhetoric. The compromise that we got from Congresswoman Pelosi, Senator
                    Mitchell, and others, the yardsticks for Chinese improvement were realistic. If
                    we had not been undercut by the economic agencies of the U.S. Government and our
                    business community, we might have worked this out.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, China policy was looking rocky. During the summer of 1993, State
                    drafted a strategy paper which we sent on to the White House. I had a lot to do
                    with drafting it. (End of tape)</p>
                <pb facs="0617" n="Page0617"/>
                <p>We had drafted this paper on the strategy of engagement with China. It
                    essentially presaged our future policy and was approved by the White House in
                    September 1993. We were trying to be more closely engaged with them. I felt that
                    some of the critics who said that we hadn't engaged in enough strategic dialogue
                    with China didn't appear to realize that we weren't exactly talking to Zhou
                    En-lai and others of the older generation of Chinese leaders. However, I
                    understood that we needed to straighten out China policy in some respects. In
                    the case of Korea we had inherited a very difficult problem from the previous
                    administration, and there weren't very many good choices available to us. So I
                    felt that we were doing the best we could on that front, and we were negotiating
                    rather than selling out to North Korea or going to war with it on the nuclear
                    issue.</p>
                <p>More importantly, I believe that we were making progress on other issues that had
                    been lost sight of. We will go into all of these issues in more detail. We were
                    already moving ahead toward normalization of diplomatic relations with the
                    Socialist Republic of Vietnam. We had raised APEC to the leaders' level, with
                    all of the positive implications of that. We were moving ahead with APEC as a
                    major instrument of free trade and investment. We had begun to launch regional
                    security dialogues, which I thought were important.</p>
                <p>On a much less cosmic scale we were improving our relations with New Zealand,
                    which had been treated as something of a pariah by the United States for some
                    time, over the issue of visits to New Zealand ports by U.S. Navy ships carrying,
                    or alleged to be carrying, nuclear weapons. In Cambodia there were free
                    elections under UN supervision, however shaky the coalition government that
                    emerged from these elections. I thought that that was a positive development. We
                    had elevated the East Asian region in terms of our interests. We were
                    maintaining our force levels. So, although I would grant that we had some
                    problems in some of our relations, I thought that the criticism had been
                    overdone.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, having said all of that, both in terms of reality and certainly in
                    terms of perception, the early months of 1994 were certainly the nadir of my
                    tenure as Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. But, during
                    the rest of 1994 and later, we really began to pick up again. I'm trying to be
                    as detached as I can in this respect. Perhaps this was less so in the case of
                    China, but we got beyond the initial MFN dispute and began to have more visits
                    and to work on a broader agenda. With Japan we negotiated several trade
                    agreements, the trade deficit began to go down, and we were stepping up our
                    dialogue, working with Joe Nye of the Department of Defense on security issues.
                    We were beginning to make progress on that.</p>
                <pb facs="0618" n="Page0618"/>
                <p>In October, 1994, we negotiated the Korean Nuclear Accord, a framework agreement
                    which was a major step forward. We made much further progress on relations with
                    Vietnam and moved ahead on that. In July, 1994, not only did the regional
                    security dialogue move ahead but we created the ASEAN [Association of Southeast
                    Asian Nations] Forum, which brought five new countries, including China, Russia,
                    and Vietnam into this security dialogue. That was a significant step
                    forward.</p>
                <p>By January, 1995, I think that we had done quite well. During this period I used
                    two instruments to try to help our efforts. First, I wrote a memo which became
                    fairly famous. This memo, which was written some time in the spring of 1994 when
                    we had the most trouble with our Asian policy, talked about the malaise in
                    Asian-Pacific policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] I would have thought that you would have avoided
                        thword malaise after President Carter used the term!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Right. So whenever I was accused of using a bad name, as you have pointed
                    out, I would say: “You people have it wrong. You haven't seen the memo. It was
                    'Malaysia,' not 'Malaise.'” I think that I was quite honest in referring to the
                    fact that we did have some problems in Asian policy. We certainly had public
                    relations problems. So this memo was a self-critique of the administration's
                    policy. By definition, as I was the key person at the working level, it was an
                    analysis of what we had been able to do, and where we were not succeeding.</p>
                <p>This memo was subsequently leaked to the press. Both the subject and the actual
                    text were leaked. I can swear on my family that I did not leak it. I've never
                    leaked any document. I really haven't. I believe that if you don't agree with a
                    policy, you should fight it out and try to win the battle over it. If you don't
                    win the battle, you soldier on. If it's such a crucial, fundamental issue, you
                    resign. But I don't believe in leaking documents. I take a very religious view
                    of this issue.</p>
                <p>Many people seemed to feel that, even if I didn't leak it, I wanted to make sure
                    that it got out. They would cite, with some justification, that it had a
                    relatively low classification. I think that it was CONFIDENTIAL. I wanted to get
                    the text to our posts, as well as to the Seventh Floor in the State Department,
                    the White House, and so on, because I thought that it was important, that we
                    ought to be reviewing the bidding, and I wanted to generate comments. But some
                    suspected that I really wanted it to get out to the press because, with such
                    wide distribution, it was bound to get out. That was not my intent, but it's a
                    fair suspicion, because there were hundreds of copies of this document in
                    circulation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] That happens.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0619" n="Page0619"/>
                <p>LORD: It happens, particularly when a memo is critical of what you are doing. So
                    I can understand that accusation, however wrong. That's just a sidebar.</p>
                <p>First, the memo did lay out where things were going well. I thought that this was
                    only fair. I didn't want to get everyone too depressed, and so I pointed out
                    where things were going well, along the lines which I have mentioned, even then,
                    in the spring of 1994. But then I spent the bulk of the memo saying that we were
                    having some problems, what they were, and why we had them. Honestly, I haven't
                    looked at this memo for a couple of years.</p>
                <p>Some people thought that this memo was written as a part of the China policy
                    debate and before the MFN decision. It was about that time, though I can't
                    remember exactly when it was. It wasn't primarily about China, though it
                    included China. Basically, I talked both fundamental issues as well as stylistic
                    problems. On China I believed we needed more strategic dialogue and to expand
                    our agenda.</p>
                <p>However, the memo wasn't written primarily because of China. China was one of our
                    problems. Basically, my view was that we have to broaden our agenda with China.
                    Human rights are still crucial, but we have to talk about a lot of these other
                    issues, like Korea and so on, as part of a broader agenda.</p>
                <p>On Japan we were already working with the Department of Defense on the need for
                    stepping up our visible as well as our invisible security dialogue.</p>
                <p>But the news focused on broad themes, not specific policies. I went through the
                    various issues before us. There was a general theme of getting more multilateral
                    support. I focused on this and the Asian values issue. I also emphasized that we
                    should act without arrogance. With other nations, I thought we should appeal to
                    self-interest themes.</p>
                <p>I talked about style generally with the Asians and how we had to be respectful
                    without rolling over. I don't recall everything that I said but I did talk about
                    our stylistic approach, and the need for greater Congressional and media
                    attention. I covered a lot of issues in this comprehensive memo. I was trying to
                    get us on a more positive track, both in terms of substance and in terms of
                    perception.</p>
                <p>I think that the memo was pretty useful. It was designed to encourage a debate on
                    these issues. When the memo leaked, a lot of people felt that I was covering my
                    flank or other parts of my anatomy by criticizing the Clinton administration on
                    our policy. This was nonsense, because I had helped to fashion it. I didn't
                    always succeed in this regard, because, frankly, we didn't have control of Japan
                    policy in the early period of the Clinton administration. There were some
                    problems. However, I was basically being self critical, too, pointing to areas
                    where we could do better. It would be nonsense to say, at least of policy toward
                    East Asia, that our problems were everyone else's fault, not mine.</p>
                <pb facs="0620" n="Page0620"/>
                <p>So that was one thing that I did in the spring of 1994 when we haproblems in
                    Asia.</p>
                <p>The other thing that I did was to convene the Chiefs of Mission conference of
                    1994. These meetings are sometimes pretty routine, but we did a lot of work on
                    this meeting. Everyone was there from all our posts and from various agencies in
                    Washington, bringing up problems and suggestions. Again, this happened in June
                    1994. That meeting was important in getting ideas on how we should approach
                    things. People then went back to their post, sometimes instituting a new style
                    and approaches.</p>
                <p>So I think that those two efforts were fairly important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] Well, regarding the memo, you can write one, but
                        thquestion is: “What came back?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: What came back was discussions with Secretary Christopher and others in
                    Washington regarding the memo. I can't remember whether we had a special meeting
                    called to discuss it. However, there was a very enthusiastic response in terms
                    of providing intellectual grist for the mill. I also invited comments from our
                    Embassies and asked them to reply to the points made in the memo. There was very
                    good dialogue with our posts.</p>
                <p>I can't quantify the impact the memo had. First of all, I am very careful to
                    avoid claiming that this memo turned around our Asian policy. I don't think that
                    things were that bad, as some people thought. Secondly, our policy would have
                    been turned around to some extent, as you always learn on the job. The whole
                    Clinton administration was learning and adjusting. But I think that the memo had
                    some influence, and in fact that we began to pick up speed. In the subsequent
                    months, there were adjustments in our approach as recommended in my memo and
                    other papers we wrote. By itself, this memo wasn't going to solve the Korean
                    nuclear problem or some of the other issues I mentioned. However, I think that
                    the memo underlined the need for greater emphasis to our China policy in the
                    sense of the need to broaden our agenda. I think that it underlined the need for
                    having other elements in our Japan policy. I think that, stylistically, we
                    adjusted our tone somewhat in the region. I did that by constant iteration and
                    instructions in this regard.</p>
                <p>Speaking generally, I think that this memo got people thinking, although I can't
                    quantify to what extent. I got some very good feedback on it from various
                    people. As I said, there was some criticism from people outside the State
                    Department who said that it was designed to have a self serving purpose at a
                    time when I felt defensive about where we were. But people in the government
                    bureaucracy and at our overseas posts tended to think that it was a very useful
                    exercise. In most cases people agreed with its main themes.Recently, I received
                    a copy of the memo as published in a Japanese newspaper. I enclose it here for
                    the record, as published.</p>
                <pb facs="0621" n="Page0621"/>
                <p>Washington - The following is a letter Winston Lord, AssistanSecretary of State,
                    submitted to Secretary of State Warren Christopher:</p>
                <p>Subject: Emerging Malaise in our Relations with Asia</p>
                <p>When this Administration took office, the fundamental challenge in the
                    Asia-Pacific region was to raise the region's profile in our foreign policy. We
                    sought to highlight the stakes for our domestic audience and convince Asians of
                    our staying power.</p>
                <p>(1) In the first year, we have succeeded - through the travels of the President,
                    yourself and others; high level bilateral meetings; major speeches setting forth
                    the vision of a pacific community; maintenance of our military presence; the
                    APEC leaders meeting; promotion of regional security dialogues; forward movement
                    with Vietnam; staunch support for a democratic Cambodia; modest improvement of
                    ties with Indonesia and Malaysia; reinforcement of relations with Australia on
                    arms control, regional security and APEC; and a change in our contacts policy
                    for New Zealand.</p>
                <p>(2) Now, we face a fresh, growing, more complex challenge. With our Asia-Pacific
                    partners more persuaded of our long term engagement, they now are beginning to
                    resist the nature of that engagement. A series of American measures threatened
                    or employed, risk corroding our positive image in the region, giving ammunition
                    to those charging we are an international nanny, if not bully. Without proper
                    course, adjustments, we could subvert our influence and our interests.</p>
                <p>(3) The malaise</p>
                <p>This spring, the positive Pacific community principles articulated by the
                    President in Seattle are being crowded out by a plethora of problems which
                    Asians perceive as caused by hostile unilateral U.S. actions. These are creating
                    a sense of resentment and apprehension in our relations with the region - and
                    also engendering some tension within the Administration.</p>
                <p>(4) Central to this malaise are the problems in our two principaAsian
                    relationships.</p>
                <p>(5) Japan and China.</p>
                <p>We view these as arising from the unwillingness of Japan and China to conform
                    their policies to international norms. Asian, and others, view us as placating
                    domestic interest groups and criticize us for tactics that destabilize
                    relationships which are central to the region's peace and prosperity.</p>
                <pb facs="0622" n="Page0622"/>
                <p>There are a host of other frictions. Our attempt to interject workers rights
                    issues into the world trade organization has been universally opposed by Asians
                    and non-Asians alike (France being the major exception). It threatens
                    (threatened?) to mar the APEC Trade Ministers meeting in Marrakesh. We have
                    sanctioned China on the MTCR, and Thailand for Libya. We just announced
                    sanctions on Taiwan regarding endangered species. We have decertified Laos on
                    narcotics, although granting them a national interest waiver softened the blow.
                    We continue to press Malaysia and Indonesia on workers' rights and Singapore on
                    its flogging sentence against an American teenager. We disagree with almost all
                    Asians about the proper tactics for promoting reform in Burma. In varying
                    degrees our promotion of human rights and democracy complicates our ties with
                    several nations.</p>
                <p>This is not to suggest that such policies are basically wrong. We have a right
                    and a duty to pursue our interests and reflect our values. Moreover, one should
                    not judge success by an absence of friction; harmony sometimes is purchased by
                    paper over differences, risking larger problems down the road. Some of the
                    frictions can be viewed as inevitable bumps in the road. The confluence of these
                    individual issues, however, has fostered malaise, eroding the sense of optimism
                    and partnership forged in Seattle.</p>
                <p>In brief, the Asia-Pacific region presents in acute form a general challenge for
                    American foreign policy. How do we reconcile our competing goals in a post cold
                    war agenda when security concerns no longer lend us a clear hierarchy?</p>
                <p>The risks</p>
                <p>The way we are seeking some goals entails costs in our bilateral relations.
                    Beyond that are the risks to our broader interests. These include:</p>
                <p>-An increasing gap between the President's vision of a Pacificommunity and the
                    reality of some bilateral dealings.</p>
                <p>-Weakened U.S. influence in APEC; lost opportunities for partnership, business
                    and growth in Asia; the prospect of an essentially damage-control agenda for the
                    President in Bali.</p>
                <p>-Less Asian receptivity to U.S. views in the regional securitdialogues you will
                    be inaugurating at the ASEAN Regional Forum.</p>
                <p>-Fuel for Mahathir's concept of an EAEC excluding the United States; resonance
                    for Mahathir, the Chinese and others who charge we are seeking to dominate
                    Asia.</p>
                <p>There are some disturbing straws in the wind:</p>
                <p>Hosokawa's undercutting of U.S. on human rights during his Chinvisit,</p>
                <pb facs="0623" n="Page0623"/>
                <p>Kim's softer pitch in Beijing on the nuclear issue,</p>
                <p>Evans playing up of our trade disputes with China and Japan,</p>
                <p>Romulo's criticism of our Korean policy,</p>
                <p>The Bangkok meeting last spring which sought to counter thuniversality of human
                    rights,</p>
                <p>Increased soundings of these themes in Asian and American circles.</p>
                <p>All of this is played out against the backdrop of dwindling resources in
                    personnel, overseas posts, and aid levels for this priority region.</p>
                <p>Balancing interests</p>
                <p>A common thread is the question of how we pursue global agenda issues in our
                    bilateral relations. In most instances, we have sought to use trade measures to
                    achieve non-trade objectives.</p>
                <p>I have long advocated the importance of raising the profile of transnational
                    issues in our foreign policy. Indeed, I chaired the Carnegie Commission report
                    which underlined this theme, served as chairman of the National Endowment for
                    Democracy and Vice Chairman of the International Rescue Committee. These issues
                    reflect our domestic agenda, congressional perspectives, important interests
                    groups and American values. Working with other agencies and functional bureaus,
                    EAP has sought to weave these interests into the fabric of our relations in
                    Asia. I have counseled my bureau and our posts to resist parochial impulses and
                    keep in mind our broader national objectives.</p>
                <p>At the same time, we must weigh the impact of pursuing specific short-term goals
                    on our overall long-term interests in East Asia and the Pacific. These include
                    tapping Asia's huge economic potential and shaping a sense of community that
                    will anchor us in the region and foster peace and prosperity.</p>
                <p>In the long run our broad economic, security, and democratization goals are
                    mutually reinforcing, but there will be times when trade-offs are required
                    between competing short term objectives. We need to look creatively for policies
                    that advance various interests simultaneously, though at times we will need to
                    set clear priorities. Our recent successful effort to define ways of promoting
                    human rights in Indonesia while furthering our economic and security interests
                    shows this can be done.</p>
                <p>Policy guides: How can we address the malaise?</p>
                <pb facs="0624" n="Page0624"/>
                <p>First of all, we retain considerable assets for influence in the region: the near
                    universal Asian-Pacific desire for a continuing American security presence to
                    maintain stability and balance between historic rivals and potential
                    antagonists. Our large market for Asian exports and our capital/technology for
                    investment. The overall trend toward more open societies from Mongolia to South
                    Korea to Taiwan to Cambodia. A fifty year legacy of good will among many
                    Asians.</p>
                <p>Upon such foundations we can and should:</p>
                <p>-reemphasize our shared interests with the Asian-Pacific region in economic
                    prosperity and peace, rekindling the positive aspects of the historic Seattle
                    conclave. The remainder of 1994 offers good opportunities; the U.S.-ASEAN
                    dialogue and the regional security meeting in May, the ASEAN-PMC and ARF
                    ministerial in July and the APEC ministerial and leaders meetings this fall.</p>
                <p>-temper our rhetoric and work with the Congress to reducexpectations about quick
                    fixes to what are often structural problems.</p>
                <p>-oppose or readjust proposals from other agencies, often pursued for domestic
                    reasons, when we are convinced that they will prove ineffective or
                    counterproductive.</p>
                <p>-weigh more carefully the costs/benefits of taking unilateraactions, consider
                    multilateral alternatives.</p>
                <p>-define more effective means to advance global agenda issues in aAsian context
                    which emphasizes gradualism and consensus.</p>
                <p>Generally, we must pay greater attention to our style. While Asians want us
                    engaged, they are increasingly conscious and proud of their accomplishments, in
                    contrast to trends in other regions. Their growing prosperity and power require
                    that our relations be seen as founded on equality. We need a sophisticated
                    diplomacy that is better calibrated to the changing Asian environment.</p>
                <p>Looking forward</p>
                <pb facs="0625" n="Page0625"/>
                <p>I plan to give this strategic imperative my highest priority in coming months and
                    have instructed my colleagues to do likewise. We have submitted a major
                    interagency PRD study on Asian policy to the NSC which begins to address these
                    questions. I have asked the intelligence community to assess Asian perceptions
                    and their impact on U.S. interests. I am convening a chiefs of mission
                    conference in Hawaii in June and have invited key seventh floor colleagues to
                    join us - the central themes will be those in this paper and the management of
                    our dwindling resources.</p>
                <p>This then is a core challenge in the Asian-Pacific region for U.S. policy makers.
                    We in EAP welcome the counsel and help of others - in this building, at our
                    overseas posts, elsewhere in the government, and in academia and think tanks. To
                    this end, I invite comments on this paper.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] Was this memo designed to stimulate thinking for the Chiefs of
                    Mission conference? Did the Chiefs of Mission conference come after the memo was
                    distributed?</p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. It came after the memo was distributed, but I can't remember the exact
                    dates. I think that, as a general rule, you ought to have a Chiefs of Mission
                    conference every couple of years, anyway. We had budgetary problems, and I
                    didn't arrange another Chiefs of Mission conference again, although I would like
                    to have done it.</p>
                <p>Secondly, it was held in Hawaii. There were a lot of newly appointed Ambassadors
                    who had been at their posts for a few months, so it was a good time to hold the
                    conference. Above all, I was concerned about some of the problems that we had,
                    and I wanted to address those as well. A meeting like this is also a way of
                    making sure that all of our Ambassadors developed a feel for the Washington
                    scene as well. We had people from other U.S. Government agencies come out and
                    address the Ambassadors. We exposed Ambassadors to Washington realities, as well
                    as the Washington people to the interests that the Ambassadors had.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] While we're on the subject of a Chiefs of Mission conference, how
                    did you feel about Ambassadorial appointments to your area? A new administration
                    had come in, and they had political payoffs and all of that to consider in
                    making such appointments. How did you feel that you came out?</p>
                <p>LORD: I felt that we won some and we lost some. I made a real effort, both on the
                    merits, to get the best people as Ambassadors, and, in terms of morale in the
                    Bureau, to get as many outstanding senior Foreign Service Officers who had
                    served the Department loyally, preferably in the Asian-Pacific region. I think,
                    on the whole, that I did well in this regard, over the course of two, three, or
                    four years. I can't quantify this. Naturally we didn't always get the
                    Ambassadors that we wanted, but I felt that, with one or two exceptions, I had a
                    full crack at getting our views across.</p>
                <pb facs="0626" n="Page0626"/>
                <p>Sometimes Ambassadorial appointments depended on the White House and sometimes it
                    was up to the Seventh Floor of the Department of State. However, more often than
                    not, we managed to get good people assigned as Ambassadors who deserved
                    appointment. I say this without being critical of my predecessor, there was a
                    feeling that, in recent years, not too much attention has been paid to this.
                    It's one thing to nominate someone as Ambassador. It's another thing to get into
                    a bloody fight to make sure the appointment is made, including lobbying people
                    on the Seventh Floor of the Department and/or the White House.</p>
                <p>I spent quite a bit of time on this matter. I believed that, on the whole, we had
                    been successful in making pretty good appointments overseas, and I felt that I
                    won more than I lost. Of course, I welcomed truly qualified political appointees
                    - such as Mondale to Japan - so long as the percentage was not high.I will just
                    finish up this overview now, and then we'll go into issues in more depth. I felt
                    that in particular, we had some pluses and some minuses in our policies in 1995.
                    Our experience in 1996 was very good on the whole. There were several
                    developments in this connection that made me feel very good. One of the reasons
                    that I left office at the end of the first Clinton term was that I felt that our
                    Asia-Pacific policy was in good shape.</p>
                <p>In 1995, by the way, we normalized diplomatic relations with Vietnam and opened
                    up an American Embassy in Hanoi. That was a major step forward.</p>
                <p>We will discuss developments with China in 1996. In the spring was the Taiwan
                    missile crisis and other issues included intellectual property rights, nuclear
                    proliferation problems, and human rights issues. By the end of the year, we had
                    gone from crisis to genuine, major progress. Secretary of State Christopher went
                    back to China in November, 1996. This was a very successful trip, and set up
                    subsequent summits. I had worked on this with Tony Lake [National Security
                    Adviser] in a July 1996 trip. The future summit meetings were announced at the
                    Manila APEC meeting at the end of 1996. So relations with China were on a
                    positive track.</p>
                <pb facs="0627" n="Page0627"/>
                <p>With Japan we had President Clinton's trip in the spring of 1996. I think that
                    this was one of the best prepared and most successful summit meetings which I
                    had ever been involved with regarding any country during my whole experience
                    with foreign affairs. This trip reaffirmed and updated the alliance after the
                    Cold War. It closed with a major joint statement on our partnership, the
                    defusing of the Okinawa rape incident, which we'll get back to, and the
                    strengthening of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. This involved working on new
                    defense guidelines that would update our treaty and clarify how we would work
                    together on various regional, as well as bilateral, security problems. This was
                    a very successful trip which made me feel particularly good, given the
                    importance which I attached to Japan and the problems which we had during the
                    first couple of years of the first Clinton term. This was the fruit of a
                    dialogue for which I give Joe Nye and Kurt Campbell [of the U.S. Defense
                    Department] full credit. Nye and I, as well as our deputies, had worked closely
                    together on security issues, which resulted in some of these results. Full
                    credit also goes to Secretary of Defense Perry, who did an outstanding job,
                    particularly on the Okinawa rape issue, on which he and Ambassador Mondale also
                    worked very hard.</p>
                <p>So I thought that relations with China and Japan were both on thright track.</p>
                <p>On Korea, the Agreed Framework which we had negotiated in 1994 was still holding
                    up in 1996. By then, and after considerable effort, we had launched Four-Power
                    Talks [involving the U.S., China, North Korea, and South Korea]. So the
                    situation in Korea was looking good. We had some tensions with our South Korean
                    friends, but we were able to ease them.</p>
                <p>By 1996 APEC had gone through several meetings with national leaders and had
                    become an institution. We had free trade and investment goals announced in APEC
                    in 1994 and made good progress in succeeding years. These were major objectives
                    which, in turn, inspired the countries of the Americas to move toward free
                    trade, and so on. So APEC was well established. Regional security dialogues,
                    notably the ASEAN regional forum, were moving ahead as well.</p>
                <p>Cambodia was still holding up. We had improved our relations witNew Zealand, as I
                    said, and strengthened relations with Australia.</p>
                <p>In short, I believed that by the end of the first Clinton term we were in good
                    shape in these countries, and in the regional generally. Of course we had made
                    some mistakes, especially early on, but I was pleased with the progress over the
                    four years, both on specific issues and on elevating the region on our foreign
                    policy agenda. The overall record stacked up quite well with the goals and my
                    March 1993 Senate statement.Now, of course, I was also fortunate in the timing
                    of my departure, since we had a domestic scandal [Monica Lewinsky affair] in the
                    White House, which emerged after I left and increasingly preoccupied the
                    President and his people and caused problems back home. There was also, of
                    course, the major Asian financial and economic crisis which also broke soon
                    after I left the government.</p>
                <pb facs="0628" n="Page0628"/>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] All right. Can we just discuss one question? There was sort of a
                    political earthquake in the United States resulting from the Congressional
                    elections of 1994, when the Republicans gained control of both the House of
                    Representatives and the Senate. The new Congressional leaders brought in very
                    much of a conservative agenda. It seemed as if the Clinton administration was
                    greatly weakened. Was there any sort of conservative focus to this
                    development?</p>
                <p>LORD: That's a very good question. I would say that, for a variety of reasons, it
                    didn't have any major impact on our Asian policies. There is no question that it
                    had a tremendous impact on political alignments in the United States. I haven't
                    thought about this systematically, but it might have had some impact on other
                    foreign policy issues.</p>
                <p>Regarding Asia, this change in Congress didn't really hurt us. First, the bad
                    news was that generally we saw people emerge in Congress who were less
                    interested and less informed on foreign policy. This was continuing an
                    established trend. We had people coming into Congress who didn't have a
                    passport. When Congressmen go overseas, which I think they should do, most of
                    them work hard. They get unfairly criticized in the “Washington Post” for going
                    on boondoggle trips. I think that there were two or three Republican Congressmen
                    who boasted that they hadn't been overseas since the late 1980s. This was a
                    ridiculous situation, in terms of ignorance. This resulted in problems caused
                    more by ignorance than ideology.</p>
                <p>Having said that, I found that most of the issues that I dealt with involved
                    contact with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the House of
                    Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, and particularly the sub-committees
                    dealing with Asia. We found very responsible leadership in these committees,
                    which continued when they were taken over by Republicans. We saw Senator Thomas
                    come in as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Sub-Committee on Asia and
                    Congressman Bereuter as Chairman of the House Sub-Committee on Asia. They were
                    both bipartisan, serious people with whom I was able to work extremely well, as
                    I did with their predecessors, Senator Robb and Congressman Ackerman.</p>
                <p>We were fortunate in the people who were chosen to serve on the key
                    sub-committees on Asia. We were also fortunate that there wasn't that much
                    controversy over Asian problems. We had problems throughout with a guerrilla
                    minority on the Hill dealing with Vietnam. The other part of the problem with
                    Vietnam involved the White House. The biggest part of the problem was political
                    skittishness of the NSC and the White House, rather than Congress. That
                    situation didn't change. It was there anyway.</p>
                <p>The Korean Framework Agreement was generally approved, but funding problems
                    emerged as we went on, but this wasn't any particular reflection of the 1994
                    elections. Problems with the Framework Agreement were more the result of North
                    Korea being such an unattractive, opaque, and lousy regime. No one liked to make
                    deals that were less than perfect with the North Koreans.</p>
                <pb facs="0629" n="Page0629"/>
                <p>On China the MFN debate, no matter who controls Congress, given China's policies
                    on other issues such as human rights, trade, Tibet, or nuclear
                    non-proliferation, always presented problems. I don't think that this problem
                    was appreciably worsened by the results of the elections of 1994.</p>
                <p>On Japan many Congresspeople continued to think that we should be firmer on
                    economic issues. Then, as we began to have more positive security relationships
                    with Japan, that wasn't much of a problem.</p>
                <p>This is a long way of saying that the elections of 1994 were of major
                    significance in terms of domestic policy and maybe some foreign policy issues,
                    but not in terms of Asian issues that could really hurt us. Ironically, I think
                    that most people would say that in general the Clinton administration on foreign
                    policy, and certainly Secretary of State Christopher, with his reputation, did
                    much better during the final two years of the first Clinton term than during the
                    first two years.</p>
                <p>This was an interesting phenomenon. At the outset of the Administration, you had
                    the stumbling over Haiti, Somalia, and Bosnia, as well as some of the Asian
                    problems that we had during the first two years of the first Clinton term.
                    Obviously, there could be criticism of many foreign policy issues, but I think
                    generally that most fair-minded people, and even Clinton's fiercest critics,
                    would say that by the end of 1996 our foreign policy situation looked a lot
                    better than it did at the end of 1994. This was despite the fact that Congress
                    was going in the opposite direction during the period 1994-1996. Now, how you
                    put those two trends together is somewhat ironic. So, the fact that we faced a
                    new, less attractive, and less informed Congress did not particularly hurt our
                    foreign policy. The Clinton Administration ultimately got its act together,
                    gained more experience, and changed some policies. We did a better job on Asia,
                    as a whole, during the last two years of the first Clinton term than during the
                    first two years.XXII. STATE DEPARTMENT ASSISTANT SECRETARY - CHINA BACKGROUND,
                    CHINA (1993-1995)</p>
                <p>Q: Could you talk about China as you described it to candidate Clinton? Also, did
                    China come up as an issue during the 1992 presidential election campaign?</p>
                <p>LORD: The answer is “Yes, of course.” As we get into this more current period on
                    China, let me say that, from the beginning, I was, of course, a strong believer
                    in engaging China. The United States and China are two great nations looking to
                    the next century. From the American national interest and in the global and
                    regional interests, they need to work together.</p>
                <p>At the same time I've never had any illusions about the difficulties of doing
                    this. Nor the fact that, throughout these years and as far ahead as I can see,
                    the relationship between the United States and China will be periodically sweet
                    and sour, if I may use this expression.</p>
                <pb facs="0630" n="Page0630"/>
                <p>Two of the more important people in my life on various China issues have been
                    Henry Kissinger and my wife. Of course, in many ways my head is with Kissinger,
                    but my heart is with my wife, in every way, but including China in particular.
                    What I mean by that is the following.</p>
                <p>Particularly when I was younger and working with Kissinger, my overwhelming
                    emphasis then was on geopolitics. I don't recall focusing as much on human
                    rights, trade, and other matters. I continue to share Kissinger's view of the
                    strategic importance of the relationship between China and the United States.
                    However, frankly, and he would admit this, too, we had somewhat of a parting of
                    the ways on China, not so much personally but conceptually, since the Tiananmen
                    Square massacre [of 1989]. Therefore, I agree with Kissinger on the one hand, in
                    the sense that I agree on the importance of engagement with China and that was
                    the basic approach of the Clinton administration. However, I assign a higher
                    priority to human rights than Kissinger does, both generally and in foreign
                    policy terms, and specifically on China. Not only because of the virtues and
                    values of human rights and idealism and the need to maintain Congressional and
                    domestic support, but also because I think that it is in China's self interest
                    to emphasize respect for human rights.</p>
                <p>I believe that China cannot develop its economy without a freer society,
                    especially in the age of information. I think that it is in China's interests in
                    terms of maintaining stability for the Chinese people to be able to express
                    themselves peacefully. With unemployment and other pressures, there will be
                    instability in China. If there is no room for peaceful dissent, then people will
                    take to the streets. For all of these reasons I think that the protection and
                    promotion of human rights should be an important part of our policy.</p>
                <p>However, I do not go as far in this direction as my wife, who also agrees with
                    the concept of engagement with China. From the beginning, she supported the
                    opening toward China and still does. Nevertheless, she believes that human
                    rights must be a centerpiece of our policies toward China. She wouldn't hold the
                    whole relationship with China hostage to human rights, but she would be much
                    more apt to go slow and be tougher unless there is more progress made in China
                    in the area of human rights.</p>
                <p>So, therefore, I don't believe in holding back the development of the
                    Chinese-American relationship because of the human rights situation in China as
                    much as my wife would favor. However, I would certainly put more stress on human
                    rights and be less defensive about the Chinese than Henry Kissinger and, say,
                    the great bulk of the American business community and experts on China. So much
                    for the general background.</p>
                <p>Now, I will start after the Tiananmen Square massacre, which I havcovered.</p>
                <pb facs="0631" n="Page0631"/>
                <p>Regarding the Tiananmen Square massacre, I was not shocked in the sense that I
                    knew that the Chinese authorities could be brutal. But of course, I was very
                    distressed by what the Chinese authorities did in Tiananmen Square, which was
                    totally unnecessary in my view. The demonstrations were fading away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in June...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: June, 1989. Coincidentally, I had left China on April 22, 1989, when the
                    Tiananmen demonstrations were just beginning to take place, a week after the
                    death of Hu Yaobang and the day of his funeral, when the first big crowd of
                    about 100,000 people assembled in Beijing.</p>
                <p>I returned to the United States as the news of the Tiananmen Square
                    demonstrations grew and I was therefore immediately invited to appear on
                    television and speak to other news outlets in May, June, and July, 1989. As I
                    said, I had left China in mid-April, 1989. Obviously, I supported what the Bush
                    Administration was doing at the time. However, I was very tough on the Chinese
                    authorities, even though I believed very strongly in the development of our
                    relations with China, where I had just been Ambassador. Like other observers, I
                    was hopeful about how the situation would turn out. I thought that the demands
                    of the demonstrators in Tiananmen Square were reasonable. I thought that the
                    Chinese Government's solution to this incident was brutal and unnecessarily so,
                    because the crowds were dispersing when the crackdown took place. In my view,
                    this situation could have been solved peacefully. So, in my comments on this
                    incident, I was very critical of the Chinese authorities.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, I still believed that we had to deal with China and had to keep
                    moving ahead in developing the Sino-American relationship. I thought that we
                    should react strongly to this incident in a rhetorical sense and apply sanctions
                    for what the Chinese authorities had done.The approximate sequence of events was
                    as follows. I had left China as Ambassador in April, 1989. After a short
                    interval my wife was commenting on CBS [Columbia Broadcasting System]
                    television, identified only as an author. During the summer of 1989 I wrote an
                    article for “Foreign Affairs” magazine, entitled “Beyond the 'Big Chill,'” which
                    was published in September, 1989. In that article, as I say, I was very tough on
                    the Chinese authorities. I said that they needed to move toward greater freedom.
                    I said how unnecessary all of this repressive action had been. But I also made a
                    strong case for holding the Chinese-American relationship together and
                    continuing to move ahead.</p>
                <p>At this point the Bush Administration had been relatively firm in its response to
                    events in China, although, even then, not enough to my liking. Its public
                    rhetoric was relatively too moderate, but the administration had taken certain
                    steps involving some sanctions. At that point I was unaware of the secret visit
                    by Brent Scowcroft [National Security Adviser] to China only a week after the
                    Tiananmen Square massacre.</p>
                <pb facs="0632" n="Page0632"/>
                <p>I showed my article for “Foreign Affairs” to Dick Solomon on the NSC staff, just
                    for his ideas but not in the sense of any censorship. We had worked together.
                    The fact remained that my article was very tough on the Chinese and maybe
                    tougher than the Bush administration wanted. However, it was also very positive
                    about forward engagement and was supportive of the Bush Administration's general
                    policy line. So there wasn't any real daylight between my position and that of
                    the administration. I thought that administration officials were fairly happy
                    with the article. However, whether they were happy with it or not wasn't the
                    point. I was simply expressing my views.</p>
                <p>Over the next couple of years the MFN issue as it related to Chinbegan to be
                    debated every spring.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: MFN means...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Most Favored Nation. It is renewed every year because of the Jackson-Vanik
                    Amendment. The President is required by this legislation to certify that
                    emigration from China [and other communist countries] is relatively free, which
                    it has been, despite all of the other things the Chinese have done. We could
                    conscientiously say that this was so. Nevertheless, we could only renew MFN for
                    a year at a time, because China didn't have permanent, MFN status. I won't go
                    into all of the details of MFN.</p>
                <p>I don't have the exact chronology before me. I don't remember whether this issue
                    came up in 1989 or whether it was too late by then to consider whether to extend
                    MFN status for China. In 1990 I did not favor placing conditions on the MFN
                    status for China and certainly was not in favor of revoking it. I have never
                    favored revoking MFN status. However, as the years went by, I felt that the Bush
                    Administration was overly soft on China, even though I believed in engagement. I
                    thought that we had allowed the pendulum to swing too far in the other
                    direction. I was getting increasingly restless about what I thought was an
                    overly compliant posture toward China.</p>
                <p>Then, it was publicly announced that Brent Scowcroft had been to China in
                    December 1989. Scowcroft was pictured exchanging toasts with a senior Chinese
                    official, whose name I don't recall. Scowcroft also made, in my view, some
                    ill-considered remarks on this occasion. This was sort of the last straw for my
                    growing impatience with the Bush Administration's posture on China. Again, I'm
                    not against engagement with China. I am not one of those right wingers or left
                    wingers who care only about human rights. However, in terms of respect for the
                    Chinese people, the world, our values, and our interests, I thought that we had
                    to take a stronger stand. I began to get more dissatisfied with the posture of
                    the Bush Administration. In fact, the Scowcroft trip pushed me over the edge, as
                    it were. I wrote a very strong op ed [published opposite the editorial page]
                    piece about the Scowcroft trip which was published in the “Washington Post.”</p>
                <pb facs="0633" n="Page0633"/>
                <p>I knew of the Scowcroft trip and wrote this article in a few days. I learned just
                    after I published the piece that Scowcroft had not only visited China in
                    December but also in July a week after the massacre. Had I known that, I would
                    have adopted an even stronger posture. Given my past service as Ambassador and
                    association with Scowcroft and others, my article made quite a splash. From then
                    on I began to express a more critical view of the administration but hopefully
                    not nasty or partisan. I kept saying that engagement with China was important
                    and continued to sound that theme. Moreover - I don't remember the exact
                    sequence of events - either when asked for my comments or when testifying before
                    Congress, I said that I was not in favor of revoking MFN status for China or
                    placing conditions on granting MFN status in 1990.</p>
                <p>I believe that by 1991, or certainly by 1992, when I was asked to testify before
                    Congress, I modified my position. I felt that, on the one hand, we should not
                    revoke MFN status for China. MFN status is really normal and available to almost
                    all countries, including terrible regimes. More importantly, I thought that
                    there was much substance to the argument that you can encourage a society by
                    engagement and by opening up our relations. If we cut off MFN status, we would
                    be cutting off the reformers and business people who were working in the
                    direction we wished. This would also hurt American business interests and
                    legitimate concerns, both in terms of our exports to China and imports from
                    China of cheaper goods for our blue collar people who buy textiles, shoes,
                    sneakers, toys, and so on. This would also hurt innocent bystanders,
                    particularly Hong Kong and also Taiwan, if we cut off MFN status for China.
                    Cutting off MFN status would be too blunt an instrument to express our
                    displeasure with what China had done. Such action would put us in confrontation
                    with China, when I still believed in engagement. On the other hand, I was
                    increasingly frustrated with what I thought was the overly soft approach toward
                    China by the Bush Administration and the fact that we didn't seem to have any
                    leverage with China. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say: “...with some reluctance?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: With some reluctance, I modified my stance. I didn't favor China's losing
                    MFN [Most Favored Nation] status. I came out in favor of what I considered
                    modest conditions for an extension of MFN status for China. The point here was
                    to lay out some objectives, sufficiently concrete to be meaningful, but not so
                    specific and detailed that we would box ourselves in. We needed to have some
                    flexibility on how we would interpret making progress. So my basic position was
                    that we needed some leverage to make progress which would not lose MFN status
                    for China for all of the reasons that I've mentioned. However, by setting some
                    modest conditions, that would give the Chinese some incentive to make progress.
                    They could do enough to meet our conditions but not so much so that they would
                    have grounds for worrying about instability or risking their control of the
                    situation. At least we would have some leverage on the Chinese because of their
                    huge trade surplus with the U.S. and because of the importance of trade to
                    them.</p>
                <pb facs="0634" n="Page0634"/>
                <p>Therefore, I advocated modest, not heavy but realistic conditions concerning
                    progress in human rights, which they could meet in the course of a year. I
                    reluctantly decided that this was the next step in trying to find a way to move
                    the Chinese on this issue.</p>
                <p>Q: You've been a Washington operator. Where did you feel that the thrust for this
                    sort of business as usual attitude or policy on the part of the Bush
                    administration was coming from? Bush had been the Chief of the U.S. Liaison
                    Office in Beijing.</p>
                <p>LORD: I thought that this attitude came directly from President Bush himself,
                    related to his time in China and elsewhere. This was proven to me in connection
                    with the Fang Lizhi incident, which we covered. Basically, he blamed me and the
                    Embassy, instead of blaming the Chinese for their outrageous behavior. I was
                    careful not to let my personal animus against him and Brent Scowcroft [National
                    Security Adviser] get in the way of my policy prescriptions.</p>
                <p>It was clear to me, in view of President Bush's supine reaction to the Fang Lizhi
                    incident, that this kind of attitude toward the Chinese was coming from him.</p>
                <p>And I figured that Brent Scowcroft shared Bush's view. Secretary of State Baker
                    was more politically attuned and kept his head down on China, because he knew it
                    was not popular in Congress and among the public more generally, although he got
                    more involved later on. So Baker was a little bit more nuanced in his approach.
                    Certainly, I thought, Bush and Scowcroft were soft on China. That's why I gave
                    you a little bit of philosophy in the beginning of this segment. I believe
                    strongly in engagement with China. I think that it's phony to debate isolation
                    versus engagement. I think that you can have engagement of a hard headed nature.
                    You can be firm with the Chinese and keep your powDer dry, but also have a broad
                    agenda of positive things to accomplish. You should hold firmly to human rights
                    but should not let human rights hold the relationship between China and the
                    United States hostage. I just felt that the balance in this relationship had
                    been upset by the Bush approach.</p>
                <p>So in careful congressional testimony I laid out this rationale for a modest
                    position on MFN extension. This would be enough to induce progress but not so
                    much as to risk losing MFN extension. I figured that the economic interest for
                    China was enough to make this approach work.</p>
                <p>I was equally strong against either extreme: either revoking MFN or placing heavy
                    conditions, on the one hand, or business as usual and not stepping up some of
                    the pressures on China, on the other hand.</p>
                <p>My view probably also came to the attention of the prospective Clinton
                    Administration, which was looking for a policy on MFN extension. They were not
                    happy with the position of the Bush administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0635" n="Page0635"/>
                <p>Now, in the course of the Presidential election campaign of 1992 candidate
                    Clinton used very strong language. He was tough on President Bush's position on
                    China saying Bush had allegedly coddled dictators, or whatever the language was
                    that he used. I was not consulted on the language he used in his speeches. I
                    thought that it was excessive. Even though I myself was frustrated by what the
                    Bush administration was doing, I had never gone as far as candidate Clinton
                    went. I thought that Clinton went too far.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Do you know where the language
                        used bClinton came from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No. I don't want to be disingenuous. I was not unhappy that Clinton was
                    being critical of the Bush approach. I was not happy with it myself. However, I
                    was not consulted and did not help to write the language which Clinton used on
                    China during the campaign. I would not have gone that far myself, because when
                    you become President, you need more room for maneuver.</p>
                <p>So after the New Haven meeting around Labor Day [of 1992] I got a few phone calls
                    on behalf of Clinton from Nancy Soderberg, Sandy Berger, Tony Lake, and so on,
                    asking for my views. I wrote a paper or two. I basically set out various options
                    and recommended the line which I had used in my testimony before Congress,
                    involving setting modest conditions, and I stress the word, modest.</p>
                <p>Thus, I advocated conditional MFN extension. So that's where I stood when I
                    ultimately agreed to serve in the incoming Clinton administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Do you have a sense that Clinton
                        usethis attack on President Bush as an important part of his campaign?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: If you are asking whether this issue came up during the 1992 Presidential
                    election campaign, in fact foreign policy was never as big a deal as other
                    issues. Clinton's basic campaign was that President Bush ignored domestic
                    policy. However, in the foreign policy area, I think that it's fair to say that
                    China was one of the three or four topics that Clinton touched on.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Right. It's interesting to note, insofar as one can
                    tell, that candidate Clinton had been to Taiwan when he was Governor of
                    Arkansas. However, he had no real experience with, or interest in, China as
                    such. So were his remarks on China part of his basic view or were they obtained
                    from someone else?</p>
                <pb facs="0636" n="Page0636"/>
                <p>LORD: I think that these views were part of his own convictions. In the first
                    place, then Governor Clinton probably was friendly to Taiwan. However, he wasn't
                    being propelled by a pro-Taiwan outlook. I think that he understood, and
                    certainly this was clear in our conversations, when he asked good questions,
                    that China was important. I want to make clear that in my briefing, and I should
                    have made this point more clearly, that, in addition to coming out modestly for
                    conditional MFN, I placed heavy emphasis on the need to engage China and the
                    importance of moving ahead. In fact, I emphasized that the U.S. and China had
                    many interests in common. I also said that I thought that we had been too soft
                    on the human rights issue and that the granting of conditional MFN was the way
                    to go.</p>
                <p>There was more discussion with Clinton in my September 1992 meeting with him, not
                    specifically on MFN, but on the relationship with China and where it had been
                    over the years. That is, what the context was and the importance of moving
                    ahead. So a lot of this discussion was based on that. Clinton asked good
                    questions. I had the feeling that even then, before he was President, he
                    considered that the relationship with China was important. He didn't want to
                    swing all the way over to isolation and containment. He genuinely was concerned
                    about China on human rights grounds. Surely, there was a partisan element in
                    this. This sort of thing happens in every campaign. Clinton saw that Bush was
                    vulnerable on this issue, and it might play well before the American people. I'm
                    sure that that was another factor.</p>
                <p>Q: Can you talk about who asked you to be Assistant Secretary of State? Also, can
                    you talk about your confirmation hearings for this position?</p>
                <p>LORD: Sure. Warren Christopher, the incoming Secretary of State, called me on the
                    phone. I don't recall the exact date, but it was sometime in December or perhaps
                    January, 1992. The appointment was not announced, I think, until January 20,
                    1993. When I was nominated to be Ambassador to China, Senator Jesse Helms
                    [Republican, North Carolina] held me up for several months. I had a long wait
                    for confirmation as Ambassador to China. This time the process was easy. My
                    appointment as Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs was
                    announced on January 20, 1993. My hearings took place about two months later, in
                    March, 1993. Then I was approved, more or less right away. I don't want to get
                    too far away from the China scene. We can get back to my confirmation hearings
                    some other time.</p>
                <p>I worked very hard on my opening statement for the confirmation hearings. The
                    Congressional relations people at State didn't want me to make a major
                    statement. They preferred bland opening statements, such as that I was happy to
                    be here, that the appointment as Assistant Secretary of State was a great honor,
                    that I looked forward to working with Congress, etc. Then I could say that I
                    would be happy to take questions from the Senators. Instead, I prepared a
                    broad-ranging speech, including my view on how we should deal with China. I had
                    to fight to give it. After all of the work I had put into the original
                    draft...</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: Wendy Sherman, for example, was the Assistant Secretary for Congressional
                    Relations. She was concerned about it. She said that I really shouldn't get into
                    tough questions and problems in a confirmation hearing. I can understand her
                    standpoint. All nominees were asked to be very bland. You don't try to make
                    policy before you're even confirmed. In principle, she had a point. In practice
                    I wanted to get out of the starting gate in a hurry and lay out an Asian policy
                    that I was sure the Administration was comfortable with. I wanted to give my
                    presentation a conceptual framework and, frankly, demonstrate to the Senate and
                    House of Representatives and to the key people there that I knew what I was
                    doing and that I was going to take a conceptual approach to foreign policy. I
                    wanted to make a more ambitious opening statement and to elevate Asia in our
                    foreign policy, because throughout our history we have usually been Eurocentric
                    in our orientation.</p>
                <p>I thought that it was important to get our regional approach out there quickly,
                    because now it was March, 1993. I wanted to make the point that Asia was as
                    important as Europe.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stick with China. Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Shortly after I was confirmed as Assistant Secretary for East Asian and
                    Pacific Affairs, in fact, within a few weeks, I had to go to Brunei to attend a
                    regional security dialogue.</p>
                <p>This was convenient, because I wanted to get overseas quickly on my first
                    overseas trip in my new position. Of course, I thought that it was also
                    important to go to China, particularly since we had the MFN deadline looming. At
                    that point some people even thought that President Clinton might recommend
                    revoking MFN for China. There was a lot of sentiment for revoking MFN or
                    attaching strong conditions to extending it in the Congress, in addition to
                    Clinton's own statements made during the campaign. There were a lot of questions
                    about what President Clinton was going to recommend. For example, was he going
                    to wait until he was close to the June renewal deadline for MFN status for
                    China? It seemed to me, and, of course, Secretary of State Christopher agreed,
                    that I should get out to China and sort of test the waters.</p>
                <p>I can't tell you the exact date I went to China on my way to Brunei and a couple
                    of other places. It was in April or May, 1993. While in China I made the point
                    that President Clinton wanted a good relationship with China. I tried to stress
                    some positive elements. I drew on and pointed to my own personal involvement and
                    the experience I had with Secretary Kissinger and then when I served as
                    Ambassador to China.</p>
                <pb facs="0638" n="Page0638"/>
                <p>The Chinese officials I met knew, of course, that I had been critical since the
                    Tiananmen Square massacre [of 1989]. So by this time they had sort of ambivalent
                    feelings toward me, all the more so since my wife had been even more critical
                    and outspoken, even though they had loved her while she was there with me when I
                    was Ambassador to China. So they probably looked at me with some ambivalence.
                    They knew that they would have to deal with me for four years. They were
                    probably concerned about what President Clinton had said in his own campaign in
                    the fall of 1992. They credited me for my role with Nixon and Kissinger and as
                    Ambassador. But for the Chinese conservatives, at least, my interaction with
                    Chinese students and the Fang Lizhi incident had created some concern.</p>
                <p>The Chinese basically listened to my presentation, which included a heavy dose of
                    comment on human rights and the need for progress. However, I was careful to
                    cover a broad agenda, including regional and global issues, as well as bilateral
                    problems. I was honestly concerned about the looming deadline on MFN extension
                    to China for another year. Therefore, I made a pitch for progress on that
                    front.</p>
                <p>The Chinese gave me a cordial reception, because of my past contributions to
                    Chinese-American relations. A new, American administration was in office, and
                    they wanted to get along with it. They sought to display general courtesy to me.
                    The reception was not as warm and outgoing as it would have been before the
                    Tiananmen Square massacre. It was a perfectly proper reception in terms of whom
                    I saw and so forth. However, the Chinese officials didn't go overboard. The
                    subsequent discussions I had were workmanlike. I didn't expect immediate
                    progress, particularly in the first meeting. I didn't get any sense that there
                    was going to be any movement on the human rights issue in particular. Therefore,
                    while I can't say that I was surprised, I surely wasn't encouraged by this trip
                    to China. Our immediate preoccupation was with the MFN debate, but I was trying
                    to set the stage for the Chinese-American relationship in general.</p>
                <p>When I returned to Washington from this trip, of course, we were getting close to
                    the MFN deadline. In the course of May in particular we had to start figuring
                    out what our decision would be. However, it couldn't just be our decision in the
                    State Department or even the White House. Congress was controlled by the
                    Democratic Party. Basically, I handled the key negotiations with Representative
                    Nancy Pelosi [Democrat, California] in the House of Representatives and Senator
                    George Mitchell [Democrat, Maine] on the Senate side. I was the point person for
                    President Clinton, accompanied usually by Wiedemann of the NSC. Of course, we
                    consulted other agencies of the U.S. Government. We weren't just winging this
                    issue on our own. However, I think that it's fair to say that the economic
                    agencies didn't feel that they had had a fair enough crack at the process at
                    that point. They never liked any conditions on MFN. Sandy Berger [Deputy
                    National Security Adviser] was involved, as were several other officials.
                    However, I was essentially the point man who worked this issue out with
                    Representative Pelosi and Senator Mitchell. We had a series of meetings with
                    them and their staffs where we crafted a package that was realistic from the
                    Administration's view and sellable to the Congress at large.</p>
                <pb facs="0639" n="Page0639"/>
                <p>What people now forget is that what we worked out at the time was, on the whole,
                    hailed as a very good outcome. To be sure, the economic agencies of the U.S.
                    Government would have preferred no conditions on MFN extension. They don't like
                    sanctions, they don't like any uncertainties in trade, and all of that. Further,
                    they advanced legitimate arguments on what might result from losing the
                    extension of MFN status to China. The business community in general didn't want
                    any conditions on MFN extension. So they were not happy. However, I think that
                    even the people in the business community and former colleagues of mine like
                    Kissinger (I believe he killed the outcome “statesmanlike”) and others were
                    somewhat pleased over how moderate the conditions on MFN extension ultimately
                    were, given the President's campaign and the Congressional mood.</p>
                <p>There were plenty of people on the other side of the argument who wanted much
                    tougher conditions on MFN extension or even outright revocation of MFN status.
                    Therefore, when we came out with what were really moderate and realistic
                    conditions, this was hailed in most quarters at the time as a significant
                    success. I'm sure that many people, certainly in Congress, thought that the
                    outcome was much too mild. In the academic community I'm sure that there were
                    some people who were opposed to any conditions at all. Certainly, economic
                    observers didn't want any conditions. However, on the whole, MFN extension with
                    moderate conditions was greeted as a significant achievement. As I recall, most
                    people were pleased because we had headed off MFN revocation or heavy
                    conditions.</p>
                <p>The outcome on this issue took into consideration President Clinton's rhetoric in
                    the 1992 campaign, which I thought had been quite heated. However, we had
                    avoided loading on conditions which the Chinese could not realistically meet.
                    Specifically, we came up with two mandatory conditions. First, there was the
                    Jackson-Vanik amendment language, which had always been there and which related
                    to free emigration from China. The other was connected with goods produced by
                    prison labor. We had five other conditions which dealt with prisoners, Tibetan
                    culture, and other matters. In dealing with these conditions we stated that
                    there had to be overall progress on them. We had to be specific enough to make
                    it possible to figure out what we were trying to do but flexible enough to give
                    us some leeway on judgements whether this related to preserving Tibetan culture
                    and history or getting prisoners released. However, we had to avoid being so
                    specific as to put us in a box, by saying something like: You must release 28
                    prisoners, or something like that.</p>
                <p>So we said that there must be significant, overall progress. It wasn't even put
                    in terms that there must be overall progress in each of the five categories.
                    There just had to be overall progress made, whether on each of them, all of
                    them, or some of them. Therefore, there was some judgment calls on what needed
                    to be done, but enough specificity to be credible to our domestic audience and
                    comprehensible to the Chinese.</p>
                <pb facs="0640" n="Page0640"/>
                <p>The feeling was that, with the Chinese stake in this bilateral relationship - and
                    we would stress other parts of the relationship at the same time and work with
                    them on this - there would be enough progress, so that, a year later, we would
                    not have to revoke MFN status for China. We would have made some progress. We
                    could then review the bidding on conditional extension of MFN status and extend,
                    revise, or drop the conditions at that point. However, all of this was
                    contingent on what we hoped and expected would be enough progress as to justify
                    renewing MFN.</p>
                <p>Q: Just to get a feel for the political environment in the United States, the
                    Bush administration, which had been a Republican administration, had been
                    castigated for being too soft on China. Was there any significant number of
                    Republicans or conservative Democrats who were in favor of doing something to
                    China?</p>
                <p>LORD: There was real doubt about the outcome. It was key that we obtained the
                    support of Representative Pelosi and Senator Mitchell, who were quite outspoken
                    on this issue and carried a majority of their colleagues. There were some people
                    like Senator Helms [Republican, North Carolina] or Congressman Solomon
                    [Republican, New York], and here I'm just picking names out of the air, who
                    either wanted to revoke MFN status for China or attach very heavy conditions on
                    MFN extension. Then there were some Democratic and Republican members of
                    Congress and a lot of Republicans like former Presidents Ford and Bush, who
                    favored MFN extension without conditions. By no means did this category include
                    all Republicans. There were conservative Republicans as well as liberal
                    Democrats who felt strongly about conditioning MFN extension. Some Republicans
                    and a few Democrats, mainly those serving on economic sub-committees and who
                    represented economic interests, didn't want any conditions attached to MFN
                    extension.</p>
                <p>The major problem at that point was to avoid having heavy conditions attached to
                    MFN extension, given the sentiment in Congress. The fact that Representative
                    Pelosi and Senator Mitchell agreed to much less than what they had said that
                    they wanted made the job easier for us. They were very statesmanlike, because
                    they didn't want President Clinton to be in a box. As long as some, modest
                    conditions were attached to MFN extension, they would go along with this
                    outcome. When we set out, it was not a foregone conclusion that we would not
                    have either MFN status revoked or have heavy conditions attached to MFN
                    extension. It appeared more likely that heavy conditions would be attached to
                    MFN extension than to have MFN status revoked.</p>
                <p>Moreover, we obtained congressional agreement to have this set forth in an
                    Executive Agreement rather than legislation. This gave the President even more
                    flexibility. These were significant achievements, given the political
                    climate.</p>
                <pb facs="0641" n="Page0641"/>
                <p>So at the time our outcome was generally hailed, as was I for my role. This was
                    generally forgotten a year later when President Clinton had to reverse his
                    position on this issue. Frankly, one reason that I received personal praise, as
                    did the Clinton administration at the time from most quarters, although I'm not
                    saying that this was unanimous, was that we were able to have Representative
                    Pelosi and Senator Mitchell deliver the broad, middle ground of people who were
                    critical of China but didn't want to wreck Chinese- American relations. When we
                    got the credentials of Representative Pelosi and Senator Mitchell behind us, we
                    were able to move ahead. There was some grumbling from economic specialists in
                    Congress and a lot of grumbling from those who thought that we had been too soft
                    on China. However, Pelosi and Mitchell gave us the necessary cover...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Senator Mitchell was the Democratic majority leader in
                        thSenate. However, Representative Pelosi...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: She was a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. She is from San
                    Francisco, represented a lot of Chinese in her district, and always has been
                    very outspoken in favor of Chinese dissidents and scholars. She had regularly
                    urged President Clinton to be firm with the Chinese authorities.</p>
                <p>Both Representative Pelosi and Senator Mitchell were very responsible in their
                    attitudes on this issue. I went up to Capitol Hill and dealt with both of them,
                    personally. There were other people with me, of course. As I say, we were very
                    pleased with the outcome.</p>
                <p>Now, the dirty little secret is that, over the next few months, in fact, thanks
                    to the extension of conditional MFN and engaging the Chinese, we made some
                    progress. Now, it was not monumental progress, and that's for sure. I don't want
                    to exaggerate it, and we never did. However, until we got to the trip to China
                    by Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in March 1994, we were beginning to
                    make some progress during that period. Secretary Christopher met his Chinese
                    counterpart in July at the regional security dialogue in Brunei. President
                    Clinton met the President of the PRC, Jiang Zemin, in November, 1993. This was
                    his first meeting with Jiang Zemin, and I'll come back to that in a minute, at
                    Seattle, when we lifted the APEC meeting to the summit level...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: APEC means?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0642" n="Page0642"/>
                <p>LORD: The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. This is a grouping of major
                    economic powers in the Asian and Pacific region to promote free trade and
                    investment. It now meets annually and is attended by heads of government. We
                    were the host at the first meeting during the Clinton Administration in 1993 in
                    Seattle and we lifted this meeting to a summit level to underline our interest
                    in Asia and the importance of Asian trade, as well as Asia's political
                    significance.</p>
                <p>The fact is that these meetings with China produced some general commitments
                    through quiet work. The Chinese, however grudgingly, were making some gestures
                    in the field of human rights. There were a few releases of prisoners, somewhat
                    better accounting of the number of detainees, and an agreement to talk with the
                    Red Cross about prison conditions. Chinese formulations on Tibet were less
                    bellicose, certainly than they are now. The Chinese agreed at some point, and I
                    don't remember the timing, to a regular and formal dialogue on human rights with
                    John Shattuck, the Assistant Secretary of State for Humanitarian Affairs. We
                    reached a prison labor agreement, and emigration from China continued to be
                    quite free.</p>
                <p>While I don't claim major progress, I believe the last half of 1993 represented
                    the most progress we made during the first Clinton term. Surely the MFN
                    conditions were of some help.</p>
                <p>MFN extension was agreed to in June, 1993, and we were looking to the renewal of
                    MFN coming up in June, 1994. We were concerned whether we were going to get over
                    the bar of debate on MFN renewal and whether enough, significant progress would
                    be made. We did not by any means think that the situation was hopeless. There
                    was enough progress in the fall of 1993 to make it possible to say that we were
                    beginning to move ahead.</p>
                <p>However, we also encountered serious problems in carrying this out. First, there
                    was general, Chinese resistance to pressure. The conditions of course were
                    public pressure, even though we worked to implement these arrangements in
                    private, as much as we could. The Chinese remained preoccupied with repression
                    and political control. Jiang Zemin himself had not yet solidified his position
                    as Chinese political leader. Above all, the Chinese considered human rights to
                    be an internal issue.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, China was extremely interested in trade and exports, and
                    sought to have good relations with the U.S. But there was disarray on our own
                    side, which totally undercut our leverage on this issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0643" n="Page0643"/>
                <p>First, there was the U.S. business community, which didn't want to have any
                    conditions placed on MFN renewal and which, at the end of the road, generally
                    doesn't care about human rights at all, although there are some exceptions. The
                    business community doesn't realize why a politically more open society is in
                    their own interest. Anyway, the U.S. business community, instead of lobbying the
                    Chinese to improve human rights practices in China, so that MFN could be renewed
                    on its own merits, was lobbying the Clinton administration to drop any
                    conditions and was very vociferous in that respect. That is, perhaps,
                    understandable and certainly legitimate, although you would like to think that
                    they would lean on the Chinese, as well as President Clinton and Congress.</p>
                <p>What was not legitimate was the behavior of our economic agencies, particularly
                    the Treasury, the Department of Commerce, and the USTR [Office of the U.S. Trade
                    Representative]. Sometimes they would put themselves on the record, expressing
                    half-hearted support for the President's policies. However, very purposefully
                    and on background, they were attacking the President's own policy. This came to
                    a crescendo in the winter and spring of 1994, but this pattern of behavior was
                    already evident from the very beginning of the Clinton administration. This
                    totally undercut us with Beijing. Obviously, they could see the disarray within
                    the U.S. Government.</p>
                <p>President Clinton, to his detriment, didn't rein in these economic agencies. He
                    refused to knock heads as he should have done in ensuring that his own policies
                    were carried out. Therefore, we had splits in our position, which the Chinese
                    could see and which totally undercut our leverage. The Chinese could say to
                    themselves: “Well, the White House is not policing its own agencies. All of the
                    economic types in the American administration are unhappy. The business
                    community is 'lobbying' the administration. They're unhappy, so why should China
                    make concessions?”</p>
                <p>I'm not saying that this is the only reason that we ran into trouble. I am saying
                    that it sure as hell hurt us. If the President disciplined his own
                    administration, we might well have pulled this off. It was a major failure of
                    leadership by Clinton, not backing the State Department in carrying out his own
                    policy, letting his economic officials undercut his own policy.</p>
                <p>Throughout 1993-1994 I convened interagency meetings to monitor our overall China
                    policy as well as progress on the human rights question. I also convened such
                    meetings in 1995-96 as we continued to make progress, despite ups and downs,
                    with China.</p>
                <p>I'll get to the March 1994 trip to China by Secretary of State Christopher next,
                    but let me circle back to President Clinton's first meeting with PRC President
                    Jiang Zemin and give a little chronology here.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0644" n="Page0644"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes, in November, 1993. By then, as I said, Secretary Christopher had met
                    the Chinese Foreign Minister in Brunei in July, 1993. I want to make this clear.
                    Christopher has been accused of not spending enough time on China. It has been
                    reported that Christopher went to Syria countless times and to China twice. The
                    fact is that he met his Chinese counterpart 12 times in four years. So, on the
                    average, this was about once every three months. Christopher made two trips to
                    China. The second trip was very successful. The first trip to China turned out
                    to be very unfortunate. Throughout the four years, he continued to correspond
                    with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. He met with him at least 12 times,
                    probably in seven or eight different cities. This included every summer around
                    the edges of the regional security dialogues. It also included every fall in New
                    York on the occasion of the UN General Assembly meetings and APEC [Asian-Pacific
                    Economic Cooperation] summit meetings. This was in addition to Christopher's
                    trips to China, and so on. We even met once in The Hague. Of course, I was at
                    all of these meetings, as I was at every Presidential meeting. The point here is
                    that Christopher devoted a great deal of time to China and was in constant
                    dialogue with his Chinese counterpart.</p>
                <p>Q: This was before the first Christopher trip to China. Christopher had been
                    Deputy Secretary of State during the Carter administration. What was your
                    impression of any baggage which Christopher carried to China, when you first
                    were getting acquainted with him, and all of that?</p>
                <p>LORD: I would say that he had a pretty balanced approach. There were two elements
                    which certainly made him somewhat more skeptical and hard-headed on China than,
                    say, Secretary Baker during the Bush administration. The main element was that
                    Christopher had always been strong on human rights and had a lot to do with
                    implementing President Carter's human rights policy. The issue of human rights
                    became a part of the U.S. agenda during the Carter administration.</p>
                <p>So Christopher had a human rights background as a lawyer, and he was genuinely
                    concerned about this issue. So he had some distaste for the Chinese political
                    system. He believed that it was legitimate to press for progress in this regard.
                    Having said that, I would add that he was obviously a very experienced,
                    international operator. He understood the importance of China in our foreign
                    policy. Christopher had spent most of his life in California, had a Pacific
                    orientation, and believed in the importance of the Pacific Ocean area. Indeed, I
                    got a lot of support from him in elevating Asia in our foreign policy.</p>
                <p>So Christopher wanted to improve relations with China but had no problem with
                    being pretty firm on human rights as part of that. Again, like me, he didn't
                    advocate holding the whole Chinese-American relationship hostage to the human
                    rights issue. He believed that human rights were an important factor. He had no
                    problem with the extension of conditional MFN status to China. He agreed that we
                    should try to make the conditions modest when we negotiated with Representative
                    Pelosi and Senator Mitchell.</p>
                <pb facs="0645" n="Page0645"/>
                <p>So that's where Christopher was coming from. He had also delivered the bad news
                    to Taiwan in early 1979 about full normalization of our diplomatic relations
                    with Beijing. In Taipei his car was rocked back and forth by Taiwan
                    demonstrators. However, he didn't hold that against Taiwan. He understood their
                    emotions, and this incident didn't make him anti-Taiwan or affect his view
                    toward Beijing.</p>
                <p>I just want to repeat at the outset that he worked very hard on the relationship
                    with Beijing. When we improved this relationship during the last year of the
                    first Clinton term [1996], I believe that Christopher did as much as anyone, if
                    not more than anyone else, to get us back on track, contrary to what has been
                    said in various media and books. Tony Lake in 1996 helped out in doing this and
                    also deserved a lot of credit for it. I worked side by side with Lake also.</p>
                <p>Anyway, President Clinton met Jiang Zemin in November, [1993], and it was frankly
                    a poor meeting. I believe that they spent about an hour or an hour and a half
                    together. At this point Jiang Zemin didn't have full self-confidence. He was
                    still consolidating his position in China. I had been dealing with Zhou En-lai,
                    Mao Zedong, and Deng Xiaoping, who were very impressive, and Jiang suffered by
                    comparison. During the course of the meeting with Jiang Zemin, President Clinton
                    asked Jiang a question about economic reforms and Chinese economic policy, as an
                    easy way to get a conversation started with him. President Clinton was then
                    treated to about a 45-minute monologue in which Jiang Zemin cited statistics. It
                    wasn't a hostile meeting by any means. It was just wasting time during this
                    first meeting between the two Presidents. Jiang Zemin went on and on about how
                    China had done economically. Then they touched on other issues briefly and to no
                    great consequence toward the end of the meeting. So very frankly, although of
                    course we went out and said what a wonderful meeting it was, President Clinton
                    was disappointed with it, as were we all.</p>
                <p>Again, I want to make clear that the meeting wasn't hostile on human rights or
                    anything else. It was just that this was a wasted opportunity on the essentials.
                    President Clinton put the usual, more positive spin on it, although if you look
                    at the statements made, you can see that we were careful not to portray it as a
                    great meeting. We didn't go overboard in our characterization of the meeting, as
                    far as I can remember.</p>
                <pb facs="0646" n="Page0646"/>
                <p>I frankly don't remember much about the Christopher-Qian meeting which took place
                    in July 1993. It was pretty workmanlike. There is no question, and I want to be
                    honest here, that during some of these early meetings, we usually had only an
                    hour or an hour and a half on the edge of an international conference. A lot of
                    the agenda focused on problem areas, including human rights, the trade deficit,
                    and nuclear non-proliferation. On the Chinese side, the issues they raised
                    included Taiwan. We tried to talk about other, positive aspects of the agenda. I
                    think, looking back, that we probably should have tried harder. Too much of the
                    meetings consisted of each side covering its complaints. However, I think that
                    people have to understand that, if you want to have a strategic dialogue with
                    the Chinese these days, it isn't all that easy. Not everyone can conduct such a
                    discussion as well as, say, Zhou and Deng used to do. And we had some real
                    bilateral problems which we had to deal with.</p>
                <p>I should add that in the summer of 1993, that is, after we had come out with the
                    MFN conditions policy, we worked on a strategy toward China. I believe that this
                    was at my initiative, but at any rate it was agreed in the State Department and
                    the White House that we should be laying out a strategy for the administration,
                    now that we had gotten through the initial MFN extension issue. While I don't
                    recall if we actually used the word engagement, although I think that we did,
                    the basic policy toward China which we are following today was laid out in that
                    memo prepared in the summer of 1993.</p>
                <p>Of course, we said that we had to be firm on human rights and we already had a
                    conditional extension of MFN. But we sought in this paper to define elements of
                    constructing a broad agenda, included trying to find positive elements on which
                    to work with the Chinese and the importance of China and the U.S. working
                    together in the next century. Outside observers discern themes at best toward
                    the end of 1996, but these themes were in that paper prepared in 1993. I think
                    that it was a hell of a good paper. It took a long while to get White House
                    approval of it, not because of opposition to it. The delay in obtaining White
                    House approval of it was just due to inertia. It was massaged through a couple
                    of high-level, interagency committees and was then sent to the President. I
                    think that he finally approved it in September, 1993.</p>
                <p>I don't think that we implemented this paper well, in terms of strategic
                    discussions. In a typical case, let's say, Secretary Christopher would be having
                    a meeting of an hour and a half, perhaps a working lunch, with his Chinese
                    counterpart. You have to cover human rights and try to make progress, as well as
                    telling the press that you covered human rights. The Chinese foreign minister
                    would take up time on the Taiwan issue. We had some urgent matters for
                    discussion, including possible sanctions on non-proliferation. You had to
                    address economic issues. So by the time you got through all of that, there was
                    very little time left to talk about North Korea, Cambodia, regional security,
                    APEC, global issues, and some of the more positive matters.</p>
                <pb facs="0647" n="Page0647"/>
                <p>So, if we had it to do over again, maybe we should have done things differently.
                    We always had longer meetings with the Chinese than we had with anybody else,
                    but then were still compressed. You could argue that Secretary Christopher
                    should have gone right away to China. I grant that. What I am saying is that the
                    basic approach of engagement with China, of having a mixed bag of positive and
                    negative issues on the agenda, of trying to construct a strategic relationship,
                    even as we grappled with these problems, and of trying to demonstrate to
                    domestic American and Chinese opinion that we had some converging and parallel
                    interests, all of that was in our basic strategy paper. We had some difficult
                    issues to deal with. But we didn't implement this strategy paper as well as we
                    might have done. And, of course, the Chinese didn't make it easy.</p>
                <p>Q: The Clinton administration came into office in 1993, not really well focused
                    on foreign affairs. I'm not talking about the Clinton team but rather how it was
                    directed. The domestic economy was considered the major issue. As an outsider
                    looking at this, I had the feeling that President Clinton did not have much
                    background on foreign affairs. In fact, he had virtually no background in this
                    area. At least as reported through the media, there seemed to be a certain
                    amount of drift and really no great focus on foreign affairs. However, you were
                    on the inside of this on major issues. Was there any of this?</p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, that is fair. I think that this was the view on the outside of the
                    administration and I think that it was also a fair view from the inside. I think
                    that most fair-minded people, who were not partisan either way, will tell you
                    that the last two years of the first Clinton term were much better in terms of
                    foreign policy than the first two years. If they are really fair, they will say
                    that the last two years of the first Clinton term were pretty good. Most people
                    would say that the first two years of the first Clinton term were pretty bad. I
                    say two years. Maybe it was a year and a half versus two and a half years.</p>
                <p>In reply to your point specifically I would say at the outset that the
                    administration had to deal with Bosnia, Somalia, and the Haitian problems, for
                    example. There was backing and filling on the extension of MFN status for China
                    in 1994. So, both in terms of perception and reality, I think that it's fair to
                    say that the Clinton administration didn't do well at the beginning.</p>
                <p>This was partly due to the process of shaking down a new administration. It was
                    partly due to the fact of the President's overwhelming focus on domestic issues.
                    Clinton was elected the first time by saying that President Bush had ignored
                    domestic issues. There was the election slogan, “It's the economy, stupid.”
                    Clinton genuinely wanted to focus on the economy from the beginning, and I think
                    that this was correctly the case. However, you pay a price for this. You can't
                    run foreign policy without the full involvement of the President and the White
                    House. This is certainly true of China policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0648" n="Page0648"/>
                <p>A good example of this is that for years I pushed strongly, and I persuaded
                    Secretary Christopher to push for a Presidential speech on China. I also worked
                    directly with the NSC [National Security Council] staff on this. I started this
                    effort in the summer of 1993. Certainly, it was one of the recommendations of
                    the strategy paper, which was finally approved in September, 1993, and which
                    contained a recommendation for a Presidential speech. I thought that it was
                    important to have the strategic approach to China laid out to the public in a
                    broader framework, so that these constant problems that we had on human rights,
                    nuclear non-proliferation, trade, and Taiwan wouldn't be the only things that
                    people noticed. These issues could be put in a broader context of the need for
                    engagement on some of the more positive aspects of the agenda.</p>
                <p>I literally spent four years trying to get President Clinton to give a speech on
                    China. In fact, I wasn't able to get the President to give a speech on China
                    during the first Clinton term. China would often be part of a speech but never
                    the main issue. Once Clinton started giving speeches of this kind, they turned
                    out to be pretty good and they helped. Even Secretary of State Christopher
                    didn't speak out solely on China for a couple of years. I was pushing for that
                    as well. Every time we could do so, we would work in a reference to China at
                    some length in a speech on Asia, or in testimony before Congress. But
                    Secretaries of State just don't get much public attention when they speak,
                    anyway. Christopher is a man for whom I have great respect, but he's no Billy
                    Graham [well-known preacher and evangelist] when he gives a speech.</p>
                <p>So the point I'm making is the same as yours. That is, President Clinton did not
                    focus that much on foreign policy. He is a very quick fix, very smart, you can
                    brief him up in a hurry, and he will do a great job. However, he just wasn't
                    that much involved. This has changed over the years, but he paid the price on
                    China because he didn't give a speech containing a strategic concept on what we
                    were trying to do, he didn't discipline his own cabinet, he didn't give
                    sustained interest or direction.</p>
                <p>Q: This points out the importance of having insiders who know how significant
                    speeches are. Insiders have that ability to deal with speeches. They know the
                    work that goes into writing a speech. If you don't make the effort, that is an
                    act in itself.</p>
                <p>LORD: It was partly the fact that we were never able to get President Clinton's
                    attention. This was due, very frankly, to some of his political advisers. If the
                    President gives a speech on China, you know that it's going to be controversial.
                    There is no way that you are going to make everybody happy. Part of the problem
                    was the lack of emphasis on foreign policy but a large part of it was the
                    realization among some of the President's advisers that this was a delicate,
                    sensitive matter. First, because it involved campaign positions. Then, as time
                    wore on, and the President changed his position on the extension of MFN, he
                    would make statements around the general subject of MFN, but these would be 10
                    and 20 minute statements. I don't mean that President Clinton never spoke on
                    China. It was just that he never gave a long speech on China, which we
                    desperately needed and wanted. It was a great disappointment, and it hurt
                    us.</p>
                <pb facs="0649" n="Page0649"/>
                <p>Q: I think, too, that you are also pointing out the problem facing a new
                    administration just entering office. The people surrounding the President are
                    essentially domestic, political operators. In many ways they have the ear of the
                    President, and there is the impetus of not making waves in the field of foreign
                    affairs. This means that foreign affairs operators like yourself continue to be
                    frustrated.</p>
                <p>LORD: This is true of many administrations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is true of many administrations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: In addition, there is the general question of giving a foreigpolicy
                    address. The specific subject of China is especially sensitive.</p>
                <p>Anyway, that was the background of the trip by Secretary Christopher to China in
                    February or March 1994. In effect, he was going to China to promote our China
                    relationship generally and specifically to make the further progress needed so
                    that we could renew MFN. Keep in mind what I said. We had made some progress,
                    but we hadn't made enough progress as yet.</p>
                <p>We were going to China by way of Australia. There was a joint meeting with the
                    Australians and the respective Foreign and Defense Ministers. While we were in
                    Australia and also while we were heading toward China, the Chinese, in advance
                    of Christopher's visit, began rounding up dissidents. This reflected their
                    general nervousness. The Chinese authorities figured that these dissidents would
                    speak out, try to meet Christopher, or something like that.</p>
                <p>Then, literally when we were flying to China and to our own surprise, Assistant
                    Secretary of State for Humanitarian Affairs, John Shattuck, met privately with
                    Wei Jingshen, the most famous Chinese dissident. Shattuck had gone to China
                    ahead of Secretary Christopher and his party to try to make more progress on
                    human rights, so that Christopher could push the ball down the field a little
                    farther. In effect, Shattuck would prepare the way. Again, we had this MFN
                    deadline coming up in a few months. So Shattuck was in China as part of our
                    formal dialogue. This was one of the reasons that we were making some progress.
                    At least we had that dialogue.</p>
                <pb facs="0650" n="Page0650"/>
                <p>Shattuck consulted with Ambassador J. Stapleton Roy, our outstanding Ambassador
                    to China, but what they didn't do was to consult with Secretary Christopher,
                    which, in my opinion, they should have done. So we were blindsided by this
                    development. The fact is that Ambassador Roy and Assistant Secretary Shattuck
                    had every reason to meet with Wei. Wei was an heroic figure. He'd been let out
                    of jail, at least on a temporary basis. This was one of the things that we
                    managed to accomplish. For about 24 hours the Chinese authorities failed to
                    react, even though, with their surveillance system, they knew that Ambassador
                    Roy and Assistant Secretary Shattuck had met with Wei. Then Wei made some public
                    remarks, and the Chinese authorities, in effect, felt forced to react. So that's
                    what happened.</p>
                <p>In any event, the Chinese authorities blasted the hell out of everybody because
                    of the meeting with Wei in advance of the Christopher visit to China. Again, I
                    believe in meeting with dissidents, but I also believe that something this
                    sensitive should have been checked out in advance with Christopher.</p>
                <p>In this atmosphere, as we were heading toward China, there were some calls in the
                    United States to cancel the Christopher visit to China. So we had debates on
                    this issue within the delegation before we got on the airplane to go to China
                    and on the airplane itself. Secretary Christopher got on the phone and touched
                    base with a few Senators and Congressmen. My recommendation was that we should
                    not cancel the Christopher visit. If we canceled the visit, we weren't going to
                    get the MFN conditions met and we would have to make the horrible decision to
                    cut off MFN extension. Then, whatever we did, the whole Chinese-American
                    relationship would come to a standstill. Indeed we might have a crisis.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, when people say that Secretary Christopher had a bad trip to
                    China, let's remember that the Chinese were rounding up dissidents before we got
                    to China. I said that we had to go ahead with the trip, despite the firestorm of
                    Congressional and media criticism at home.</p>
                <p>So, in effect, I recommended on the plane, and I think that we pretty much all
                    agreed on this, that we should not cancel the Christopher visit. Instead, I said
                    that we should make some public statements and some on background that we were
                    very unhappy with what the Chinese authorities were doing. So we recommended
                    that Secretary Christopher should get on the phone, from the plane, to some key
                    Senators and Congressmen, to deflate any pressures to cancel the trip and assure
                    them that we would press strongly on these issues. We felt that Secretary
                    Christopher should do all of this before he reached China. In this way he would
                    have made the point and protected his domestic flank while he was going ahead
                    with the trip. At the same time, if he didn't do this so vocally on Chinese
                    soil, it would be somewhat less provocative to the Chinese. In this case the
                    Chinese authorities were being provocative by rounding up dissidents. Still, we
                    didn't want the whole trip to fall apart.</p>
                <pb facs="0651" n="Page0651"/>
                <p>This was my recommendation, others on the plane agreed, and Secretary Christopher
                    agreed with it. He used some pretty tough rhetoric before we arrived in China. I
                    say that because he has been criticized. Well, the point is that he could either
                    cancel the trip or just ignore what the Chinese authorities were doing, such as
                    rounding up dissidents, and so on. I felt, and I still feel, that all that
                    Secretary Christopher could do was to be firm in public before he got to China.
                    This was to justify going ahead with the trip and to show the Chinese that he
                    wasn't just a pushover. Then he need not be so be critical of the Chinese on
                    Chinese soil and could see whether we could make progress.</p>
                <p>When we reached China, we had a frosty reception. I forget how long we were
                    there. I think that it was for two or three days. The first meeting was with Li
                    Peng [Prime Minister], who was extremely rough and tough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: He was very dismissive of Christopher, accused him of meddling in China's
                    affairs, and criticized Assistant Secretary John Shattuck's dealing with Wei. We
                    didn't make progress on other issues, either. Li Peng was always tough on human
                    rights issues. So it was just a very nasty atmosphere, and the general
                    atmosphere of the Chinese reception was cool.</p>
                <p>I don't whether the next meeting took place on the same day or not. I wouldn't
                    say that President Jiang Zemin played “good cop” to Li Peng's “bad cop.” Jiang
                    Zemin wasn't particularly friendly, either, but he was a lot less vitriolic.
                    This was his style, anyway. He's always been more tempered in dealing with our
                    relationship than Li Peng has been. However, Jiang Zemin was also less than
                    cordial. He was less insulting, but he was fairly firm. I had the feeling that
                    he was sort of letting us know that first we were going to be hit over the head.
                    Then he would ease up a bit, and we were supposed to feel grateful.</p>
                <p>Actually, on the last day of the visit, when we met with Foreign Minister Qian
                    Qichen, we began to make some progress on a few issues. They were not major
                    issues, but compared to where we started with at the beginning of the visit, we
                    moved forward. In the course of this visit there were some volleys fired back
                    and forth with the Chinese press spokesman. I had to brief our press. The
                    Chinese blamed us for hurting the atmosphere of the trip. This was during the
                    trip. I got up and said that this was a great “leap of chutzpah” on the part of
                    the Chinese. In effect, they accused us of ruining the atmosphere of the trip
                    while they had been rounding up Chinese dissidents. So there were some pretty
                    nasty exchanges, back and forth. I was pretty pleased with some of my one-liner
                    comments. This was clearly not making the trip a smashing success, but I felt
                    that we had to be firm in facing the Chinese.</p>
                <pb facs="0652" n="Page0652"/>
                <p>So we left China obviously unhappy. We had made no progress on human rights.
                    There were a couple of vague promises in a couple of areas, but I can't remember
                    what they were. As I say, the meeting with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen was
                    somewhat better, but mostly in relative terms. We made some headway on a couple
                    of other issues. All in all, the trip wasn't a total disaster, since we had made
                    some progress. But the press was already saying that the visit had been a
                    disaster. People back in the U.S., including the representatives of the economic
                    agencies, were giving background interviews with reporters. They were directing
                    their attacks at Secretary Christopher, and not the Chinese. This was really a
                    disreputable performance by our government.</p>
                <p>Of course, it was important to get a White House statement backing up Secretary
                    Christopher. This had to be a Presidential statement, saying that Christopher
                    had represented American interests firmly. We needed a statement which said that
                    we wanted good relations with China, but the Chinese had to behave themselves
                    better, and that kind of thing. We never got such a statement from the
                    President, who remained silent. Christopher tried to get this statement but
                    without success. So the combination of the attitude of the economic agencies in
                    undercutting Christopher and the President's not only not coming to
                    Christopher's aid or disciplining his cabinet but just being silent made this a
                    very tough period. The White House was irresponsible, leaving Christopher (and
                    the rest of us) twisting in the wind.</p>
                <p>We didn't have a great deal of conversation on the plane. However, Christopher
                    and I, more or less independently of each other, began to think through where we
                    went from there in our policy toward China. Christopher was detached and cool
                    enough at the time. Rather than just getting mad at the Chinese, Christopher
                    felt that we had to rethink whether we were on the right course on the MFN
                    issue, however modest the conditions were and whether the MFN issue wasn't too
                    blunt an instrument for dealing with the Chinese. He was wondering whether we
                    had to think of some other approach.</p>
                <p>So we returned to Washington. It was pretty clear now by March, 1994, that we
                    weren't going to make it over the hump and get enough progress on human rights
                    to get an extension of MFN status for China by May, because of the lack of
                    progress on this trip and the disarray in our own government. The U.S. business
                    community was continuing to lobby us and not the Chinese.</p>
                <p>We made one last effort during this period by sending Mike Armacost, former Under
                    Secretary of State, to Beijing on a secret trip to Beijing to try and get last
                    minute development on human rights. We made little progress.</p>
                <pb facs="0653" n="Page0653"/>
                <p>During the spring of 1994 we went through an agonizing reappraisal. We did a lot
                    of computer runs, working with the Department of Commerce, to see whether it was
                    possible to come up with an MFN arrangement hitting only those Chinese exports
                    that were from Chinese military industries or were derived from military
                    sources. In other computer runs we considered to what extent we could hurt China
                    with higher tariffs on some Chinese exports but wouldn't hurt Hong Kong or
                    Taiwan. So we tried to see, since the Chinese did not make enough progress on
                    human rights, whether there was a way selectively to affect Chinese exports by
                    hitting only military industries or picking products that didn't affect innocent
                    bystanders.</p>
                <p>We just couldn't find any way of doing this. There was no way to sort out the
                    Chinese structure of military versus civilian companies and cut-outs and cover
                    and producers versus exporters and holding companies. The only thing that we
                    could identify, which we finally did, was Chinese arms exports of handguns to
                    the U.S., which were coming onto our streets. That was one kind of merchandise
                    which was coming from the Chinese military, and we could single it out. But we
                    just couldn't come up with a nice deus ex machina program to identify anything
                    else to get us out of this box.</p>
                <p>We had hoped that we could say, in effect: “We don't want to cut off all of our
                    trade with China, but we are going to hit them selectively because they haven't
                    made enough progress on human rights. We are going to hit military companies, we
                    are going to spare Taiwan, Hong Kong, etc.” We figured that this might be enough
                    to satisfy our domestic audience in the U.S. We would admit that China had not
                    made enough progress on human rights and so we were taking these limited steps.
                    We weren't going to cut off all MFN trade. We were trying to get something that
                    might affect, for example, 10 to 20% of their exports to the U.S., as opposed to
                    the majority of their exports. So there would be enough damage limitation so
                    that we could continue with MFN status on most Chinese exports to the U.S. and
                    avoid the major problems I mentioned. We would have selectivity in the
                    application of trade controls, avoiding harming Hong Kong and Taiwan, but also
                    maintaining some momentum in the overall Chinese-American relationship.</p>
                <p>Well, as we got down to the wire, we found that we didn't have those options. We
                    just couldn't come up with a program or, rather, the computers couldn't find
                    it.</p>
                <p>So then we had three choices. First, we could say that the Chinese hadn't met the
                    conditions, however modest, for the extension of MFN. Therefore, we were
                    revoking MFN status for China. We didn't want to do that for all of the reasons
                    I have mentioned. The negative impact on Chinese-American relations and on our
                    business and exports, as well as the impact on Hong Kong and Taiwan were
                    generally things that we wanted to avoid. We never wanted to harm them.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0654" n="Page0654"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you explain why, whatever we did with MFN status for
                        China, iwould have an effect on Hong Kong and Taiwan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, a great deal of Chinese exports to the U.S. go through Hong Kong.
                    Many of them are reprocessed and given a higher value in Hong Kong. This is one
                    reason why we have disputes in our trade. The Chinese think that we exaggerate
                    the deficit in our trade with China, because a large part of this trade with the
                    U.S. really comes through Hong Kong. So, by hitting Chinese exports to the U.S.,
                    we were going to hit the economy of Hong Kong very heavily. I don't have the
                    figures in front of me, but a great deal of Chinese trade with the U.S. goes
                    through Hong Kong. And a large number of jobs in Hong Kong would be affected. We
                    would be raising tariffs on goods of Chinese origin, if China lost MFN status,
                    to a level which would be prohibitive, in many cases. Hong Kong would have been
                    severely affected, and Taiwan, somewhat less so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would Taiwan have been affected? Was Taiwan also at
                        thapoint reprocessing mainland Chinese goods destined for the U.S.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Taiwan had some investment in China and so it imported some goods from
                    China, reprocessed them, and then re-exported them to the U.S. from China.
                    Indeed, a large part of our trade deficit with China was caused by Hong Kong and
                    Taiwan production going into China. So our trade deficit went down with Taiwan
                    and Hong Kong but went up with China. But Hong Kong and Taiwan still would have
                    been affected by our limiting our trade with China.</p>
                <p>There were mixed feelings in Taiwan because the government there didn't like
                    Beijing. However, they also didn't want to hurt their own economic interests, so
                    they were pretty quiet on this issue. In fact, the Taiwan Government did not
                    lobby Congress to cut off MFN status for China. I think that the Taiwan
                    Government just stayed neutral on this issue. So, one of the choices facing us
                    was cutting off MFN status for China. We didn't want that choice. In the U.S.
                    government, I believe John Shattuck was the only one favoring revocation of MFN,
                    or at least selective revocation.</p>
                <p>Another choice was to say: “Well, China already has MFN status. We're not happy
                    with Chinese behavior. However, based on how we define them, the Chinese have
                    met enough of our goals, and we will renew MFN status for China.” Maybe we could
                    again renew MFN extension but with conditions. That would be one sub-option. We
                    could renew MFN status, saying that China had made enough progress to justify
                    renewal, but we are still going to keep some conditions on because China has not
                    done as much in the field of human rights as we would like. We rejected that
                    course as well. Rejection of this course was strongly recommended by Secretary
                    Christopher, myself, and others because it would have lacked credibility.</p>
                <pb facs="0655" n="Page0655"/>
                <p>On the two mandatory conditions, emigration was an easy call - dissidents and
                    other people could get out of China without any great difficulty. Prison labor
                    involved somewhat of a stretch, but in good conscience, taking into account the
                    views of the lawyers, we could say that we already had a prison labor agreement
                    and we had some inspections provided for to ensure that they were not exporting
                    the products of prison labor. It wasn't an airtight breakthrough by any means,
                    but we thought that it was enough to justify meeting that condition. However, in
                    terms of overall significant progress in releasing prisoners, there wasn't much
                    to point to. The Chinese authorities had let some people out, but they were also
                    beginning to round up others. On prison conditions nothing had really happened.
                    Nothing had happened in the case of Tibet. On these and other conditions, we
                    just felt that the Chinese authorities hadn't made significant progress on them.
                    If we had tried to stretch what had happened, we would have had a firestorm in
                    Congress. Probably this would have resulted in having the President overridden
                    by Congress, anyway.</p>
                <p>In any event, it would have made the President look so eager to stretch the truth
                    that he would have done anything to renew MFN status for China. We would have
                    lost credibility in Beijing because the Chinese Government would have concluded
                    that the American Government was so desperate to renew MFN status for China that
                    they were calling our bluff. The Chinese hadn't made any real progress on most
                    issues. Our lack of credibility would have had an impact around the world. So we
                    ruled out manufacturing progress because of domestic and Chinese reaction.</p>
                <p>I think that the third choice, which we eventually selected, was the least bad
                    alternative. Certainly, it was what I recommended at the time, but it was very
                    embarrassing. It meant a reversal of policy. The President hadn't been willing
                    to discipline the economic agencies or present a united front in any event. The
                    Chinese would continue to do what they had been doing, and placing conditions on
                    renewal of MFN status just wasn't going to go anywhere. We weren't prepared to
                    pretend about progress allegedly made and we weren't prepared to revoke MFN
                    status for China. So we felt that the only choice we had, and the least bad
                    choice was simply to renew MFN, while pressing human rights in other ways. And
                    this is what we did.</p>
                <p>This was awkward, but it was the only choice available to us at the time. Some
                    people might say that we should never have placed conditions on the renewal of
                    MFN. Some people said that we should have kept MFN, while others said that we
                    should have revoked MFN status for China. I still feel, to this day, that if we
                    had had a united administration and a strong President on this issue, we might
                    have pulled off our initial policy of MFN renewal with modest conditions.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: I was just curious. In initiating this policy to what
                    extent, if at all, did you consider that you were giving leverage to the
                    Chinese? In many ways the renewal of MFN status for China could only work with
                    Chinese good will. That is, if the Chinese were willing to come far enough under
                    these conditions. So the initiative for making the Clinton administration policy
                    work was in Chinese hands. Was that a consideration?</p>
                <pb facs="0656" n="Page0656"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes. However, put another way, we felt that the Chinese had enough of a
                    stake in the Chinese-American relationship in general, and the export and
                    trading part of it in particular, to have Chinese good will. After all, we were
                    taking one-third of their exports, and they had a huge surplus in their trade
                    with the U.S. Therefore, in this view the Chinese had an incentive to cooperate
                    with us, if not out of good will, at least in their own self-interest. However,
                    that depended on China's concern that there was a real danger of their losing
                    MFN status. And between the business lobbying and what the economic agencies
                    were saying, that clearly was not the case. There is no question that one can
                    criticize conditional MFN, albeit forgetting that we headed off revocation of
                    MFN and the imposition of heavy conditions on MFN extension. You can say that
                    extending conditional MFN status should never have happened in the first place,
                    but in 1993 we faced the realities of Clinton's campaign positions and the
                    congressional mood.</p>
                <p>The President said that he wasn't going to pretend about the extent of progress.
                    He said that we considered that conditional MFN renewal had been a useful
                    instrument up to now, but we had used up whatever utility it had, and we
                    couldn't make any further progress on this front.</p>
                <p>We stated how we would be vigorous on human rights on other fronts. Specifically,
                    we revoked or cut off MFN status on Chinese small arms and handguns, so there
                    was a tiny sector that we did hit. We stressed that we would continue to
                    consider human rights a very important part of our policy and that we would do
                    it through resolutions passed in Geneva, and through the human rights dialogue.
                    We began to mention legal reforms in China at that time. We mentioned that we
                    would work through Radio Free Asia and other programs involving non-governmental
                    organizations. We also said that we would try to work with the business
                    community on the adoption of good business principles to promote human rights.
                    There were a couple of other elements which were announced at the time.</p>
                <p>So we've renewed MFN without conditions and changed our position. And we set out
                    to improve our relations and press human rights in other ways.In the fall of
                    1994 Secretary Christopher met again, in Indonesia, with the Chinese. The APEC
                    meeting that year was in Bogor. He was working hard by cable, by letter, and
                    also at periodic meetings with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. Various
                    issues came up, but I can't give you the chronology.</p>
                <p>We had the famous case of the Chinese ship with the chemicals on it. We received
                    poor intelligence from our people. The ship wasn't transporting dangerous
                    chemicals. We stopped the ship, boarded it, and examined it. We got egg on our
                    face as a result. What happened was that our intelligence people had proof, from
                    the cargo manifest of the ship, that it was scheduled to load certain dangerous
                    chemicals on board. Either the Chinese snookered us in a kind of con game and
                    took these chemicals off at the last minute to embarrass us or, in fact, they
                    had unloaded it in planned fashion. It didn't have any dangerous chemicals on
                    board at the time we inspected it. The Chinese predictably blasted us for
                    this.</p>
                <pb facs="0657" n="Page0657"/>
                <p>We were also concerned about Chinese nuclear proliferation activities with
                    Pakistan. We had to slap sanctions on China a couple of times in this
                    connection. I think that this occurred once in 1993 and again in 1995.</p>
                <p>We made very little progress on human rights. The Chinese called off the dialogue
                    with Assistant Secretary John Shattuck after a while. We would go to Geneva and
                    lose on the votes taken there to pass a resolution critical of the Chinese.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the Chinese were somewhat helpful on North Korea and became
                    increasingly helpful in this connection. On Cambodia the Chinese halted their
                    aid to the Khmer Rouge. They were more helpful there and supported the UN
                    operation and the elections. Our exports to China were increasing, even though
                    the overall trade deficit with China was increasing generally. There was some,
                    slogging progress on nuclear non-proliferation, particularly in the wake of the
                    sanctions that were applied to China.We tried to talk about broader issues with
                    China. We began to talk about developing a new agenda on some of the global
                    issues. So the Chinese-American relationship began to make some progress. It was
                    not dramatic, but clearly it was getting way beyond the level of the Christopher
                    trip, which had gone so badly.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Could you say something about the relationships within
                    the American administration? One of the things that has often been talked about
                    is the growing role of Ron Brown, Secretary of Commerce, in defining how the
                    relationships worked, and foreign policy more generally. What did you see as the
                    dynamic in this situation? To what extent was Secretary Christopher as important
                    a player as previous Secretaries of State might have been?</p>
                <p>LORD: I think that Secretary Christopher was important during this period. No
                    question about that. In fact, on China I think that he was the most important
                    player short of President Clinton, despite criticism of him. Now Tony Lake, the
                    National Security Adviser, got into this picture constructively toward the end,
                    and we'll get into this later. But in the first few years, his deputy, Sandy
                    Berger, was the key person at the NSC on China, and Asia generally. Having said
                    that, there was no question that Christopher did not control foreign policy as
                    Kissinger did. So there was in some people's eyes, and probably in the eyes of
                    the Chinese, some varying degrees of emphasis which were different, if nothing
                    else.</p>
                <pb facs="0658" n="Page0658"/>
                <p>Whenever there was an economic cabinet member, like Ron Brown, or the Secretary
                    of the Treasury, or the USTR [United States Trade Representative] going to
                    China, we would work with them. I would often send one of my people with them.
                    We would brief them and encourage them to raise human rights, even as they
                    promoted our economic or commercial interests, and try to show a united front.
                    This was particularly the case after the tough going early in the Clinton
                    administration. I must say that, after that change in MFN policy, we had a much
                    more united and disciplined administration. Most official visitors who went to
                    China, even though they didn't particularly like it, would raise the human
                    rights issue. So we began to get a more cohesive policy, partly because with no
                    conditions standing in the way of MFN renewal, the economic agencies were
                    comfortable with the policy. I think that the President was happy no longer to
                    have this yearly deadline of MFN renewal staring at him. It had been an awkward
                    and embarrassing situation, but we began to make progress overall with the
                    Chinese.</p>
                <p>Again, the economic agencies were important, but they didn't dominate foreign
                    policy. We had very good relations between the White House and the NSC [National
                    Security Council]. That was generally true with regard to policy toward East
                    Asia. The NSC Asian officers and I and my colleagues worked extremely well
                    together. The same with the Defense Department.</p>
                <p>On China there were a lot of skull sessions, particularly when we got to the
                    renewal of MFN status each year or when the President was going to meet Chinese
                    President Jiang Zemin at an APEC meeting or Secretary Christopher was going to
                    meet Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen at some international conference.
                    There would often be an interagency meeting, usually chaired by Sandy Berger
                    [Deputy National Security Adviser]. Tony Lake [National Security Adviser] wasn't
                    too much involved with China in those days. We worked well together, so there
                    was a cohesiveness which had been previously missing. I think that it is fair to
                    say that, although the White House became more involved, the Department of State
                    was still in the daily lead on China policy. However, the economic agencies were
                    important and were bound to be important. At this point we at least had a united
                    policy. It was constructive that the White House became generally more
                    interested and in control of China policy. Christopher and I personally were
                    fully involved throughout. There has been some revisionsm that after the 1994
                    MFN change the White House took over and State was cut out. This is total
                    nonsense. We worked very closely together.</p>
                <p>Secretary Christopher very much promoted our economic interests. He took a lot of
                    time at meetings in doing this, even the economic agencies would mention human
                    rights when they went to China. So we had a better team at this time than had
                    previously been the case.</p>
                <p>Q: Were we, not only in front but virtually all by ourselves in dealing with
                    human rights in China, compared to the British, the French, and so forth?</p>
                <pb facs="0659" n="Page0659"/>
                <p>LORD: The answer is “Yes.” I have said publicly that our friends would hold our
                    coats when we raised some of these tough issues with the Chinese, whether it
                    concerned human rights, nuclear non-proliferation, or even trade negotiations.
                    They would hold our coats and then take the trade contracts while we took
                    Chinese annoyances.</p>
                <p>That's a very good point. It's another reason why the conditional approach on MFN
                    renewal did not work. We were all alone in this respect. No other country tried
                    to put on sanctions or conditions on trade status. Other countries didn't press
                    the Chinese on human rights. There were modest exceptions to this, like Great
                    Britain, because of Hong Kong, and Australia, because they cared about human
                    rights. Other countries just went through the motions. So the Chinese, of
                    course, were very adept at saying: “Well, you people may want to place
                    conditions on MFN renewal or keep bugging us on human rights, which are our
                    internal affair, but our European and Japanese friends don't do this. We'll just
                    give them the contracts.”</p>
                <p>In fact, the Chinese wouldn't always do that because we might have better
                    technology or better deals. The Chinese didn't want to be dependent on Japan and
                    Europe, so the Chinese bark was sometimes louder than their bite. However, there
                    were times, for example, when we were left with the feeling that maybe Airbus
                    Industries got a contract for aircraft that Boeing might have gotten. Maybe some
                    French or Japanese company got something that an American company might
                    otherwise have gotten.So this lack of multilateral help hurt us. One of the
                    criticisms was that the U.S. was pressuring the Chinese unilaterally and why
                    didn't we do this in coordination with our friends? The answer to this is that
                    we tried very hard to get our friends to act in coordination with us. I would
                    have policy talks with my counterparts, including the British, the French, the
                    Germans, and the Japanese in particular, and try to persuade them to work with
                    us on human rights issues so that we would have a more effective approach to the
                    Chinese. We never got anywhere with this approach. This really hurt our efforts
                    in the field of human rights in China. No question about it.</p>
                <p>One of the reasons that our business community was upset with stressing human
                    rights was that they figured that the Chinese would shift business to their
                    competitors.</p>
                <p>Q: During the period from 1993 to 1997 the issue of birth control and
                    particularly of abortion were hot button issues in American politics. Did you
                    have to deal with that?</p>
                <p>LORD: I had to deal with that, but, strangely enough, even though it was always
                    there and always simmering, these never became overriding issues. There were
                    major issues on human rights in general, but I would say that prisoner release,
                    Tibet, and prison labor policy. Of course, some Chinese officials saw the need
                    to hold down the growth of China's population in any way possible. However, I
                    think that there was less and less proof that forced abortions were going on,
                    although there surely were some. This issue, at least in my recollection, never
                    became one of the major matters.</p>
                <pb facs="0660" n="Page0660"/>
                <p>Every now and then there would be related matters like infanticide, killing girl
                    babies, mistreatment of orphans, organ transplants, or issues related to these.
                    These might come up. However, these were just among the human rights issues that
                    we were concerned about. They were never at the top of the agenda. We were
                    concerned about them, but I just don't think they caused that much steam in
                    Congress, compared to other matters, like prisoners and Tibet.Q [Nancy Bernkopf
                    Tucker]: One other question. I'm not sure whether it belongs here or maybe
                    later, but how much access, if at all, did people concerned with the China
                    portfolio have to the President? Did you have opportunities to meet with him and
                    brief him? Did Secretary Christopher go on trips with him?</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, early in the first Clinton term foreign policy was not the
                    President's major preoccupation. However, we would meet with President Clinton
                    before he met with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, perhaps a week or so in
                    advance. Then we would meet with President Clinton again just before he would go
                    into the meeting.</p>
                <p>Most of the interagency meetings on China policy were at the level of Sandy
                    Berger [National Security Adviser], Peter Tarnoff [Undersecretary of State for
                    Political Affairs], and myself, at the Department of State level. Joe Nye would
                    sit in, representing the Department of Defense. These meetings did not involve
                    the President. I don't recall a full-scale, NSC [National Security Council]
                    meeting on China alone during the first two or three years of Clinton's first
                    term, if, in fact, such a meeting ever occurred. There were a couple of sessions
                    at which we briefed the President, attended by outside experts in addition to
                    ourselves. However, President Clinton did not pay a great deal of attention to
                    foreign policy at this time. He made up for this later on, to some extent.
                    Often, if he was going to an APEC meeting or on an Asian trip, we would work in
                    China issues as well. I can't recall more than one or two such sessions which
                    were just on China, for example, before President Clinton met with Chinese
                    President Jiang Zemin. However, President Clinton is a quick study, and we had
                    the opportunity to brief him before he would meet with someone, as I say, like
                    Jiang Zemin.</p>
                <p>Generally, briefing President Clinton was a little hair raising because he was
                    usually late for them. I'm talking about the briefings just before he would go
                    into a meeting. These are supposed to take place an hour in advance of such a
                    meeting. But the President would show up for his briefing with only about 15
                    minutes to go before the meeting. Several people would be standing around in the
                    Oval Office in Washington or some hotel, wherever we were, shouting last minute
                    advice at him. He would be looking through his talking points. His press
                    secretary would be going over his public statements. We would be pretty nervous.
                    We didn't know how much homework he had done and whether he could absorb all of
                    this advice. However, he would perform quite well at these meetings.</p>
                <pb facs="0661" n="Page0661"/>
                <p>Now, as time went on, some outsiders thought that our China policy was not really
                    progressing as much as it should have. We did what we could to engage the
                    President. I know that, on occasion, President Clinton met with former Secretary
                    of State Kissinger or Al Haig. Often, businessmen would weigh in on U.S. policy
                    toward China. We know now, of course, that even campaign contributors could do
                    that. However, in terms of your basic question as to whether President Clinton
                    was exposed to a lot of expertise and heavy thinking and debate on China policy,
                    I shouldn't think so.</p>
                <p>Q: There wasn't somebody who was a friend of President Clinton's from Little
                    Rock, Arkansas, who had a Chinese cousin or something like that? Sometimes, it
                    happens that somebody who is personally close to the President may have
                    pronounced ideas on China.</p>
                <p>LORD: It's not surprising that business people, either in a meeting or if they
                    are talking to the President at a reception, or when they are having coffee with
                    him, or on some such occasion, would advocate trade or investment with China, or
                    engagement with China in general. There is nothing wrong with that, and I am
                    convinced that anything which President Clinton did on China was not done as a
                    favor to contributors. Again, we have to look at investigations now going on and
                    make sure that they are fully carried out. However, President Clinton's views on
                    China policy would have been what he thought was in the national interest, not
                    the result of a lot of systematic access by outsiders. That was true, not just
                    on China, but on foreign policy issues in general. At the same time, the
                    consistent economic emphasis by businesspeople seeing him undoubtedly had an
                    effect.</p>
                <p>So we were sort of moving ahead on China policy. I can't quantify it. However, as
                    we reached the beginning of 1995, we had had these periods of ups and downs.
                    Then we reached the visit to the U.S. by President Li Teng-hui of Taiwan.</p>
                <p>Let me just step back on Taiwan for a minute. In 1993-94, we launched the first,
                    systematic review of our Taiwan policy since the passage of the Taiwan Relations
                    Act in 1979. This review went on for a good year or so, including debates on how
                    bold we could be. I don't remember the specific timing, but it happened early in
                    the first Clinton term. We in the bureau led this effort, personally headed by
                    me and my deputy, Tomsen.</p>
                <p>There was never any feeling that we were going to revolutionize policy toward
                    Taiwan in one way or another. We weren't going to go backward and resume having
                    official relations with Taiwan. That would really have hurt ourselves with
                    Beijing, as it was one of the most sensitive areas from Beijing's point of view.
                    Nor were we going to flip over, do the bidding of the PRC [People's Republic of
                    China] Government, and hurt Taiwan in any significant way. That would be weak,
                    unnerve allies, demoralize a good friend, and caused an upheaval in
                    Congress.</p>
                <pb facs="0662" n="Page0662"/>
                <p>So this review was constrained from the beginning, and I think correctly so. We
                    didn't want strawmen options and we ruled out either extreme. However, within
                    that framework we wanted to see whether we could strengthen ties with Taiwan,
                    without significantly hurting our China relationship.</p>
                <p>Many anomalies had grown up since we had passed the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979.
                    These had turned out to be awkward in terms of how we deal with Taiwan, because
                    this relationship has to be unofficial. So the questions came up, Where can you
                    meet Taiwan officials and in which U.S. Government buildings?” What level of
                    American Government officials can go to Taiwan? Who could visit the U.S. from
                    Taiwan? What shall the name be of the Taiwan Government office in Washington? A
                    lot of things were rather hurriedly thrown together in 1979 to compensate for
                    normalization of relations with the PRC [People's Republic of China] and to
                    control keep our ties with Taiwan, both in legal terms and in terms of
                    nomenclature, and in political terms with regard to Beijing. These arrangements
                    had become cumbersome and awkward in dealing with Taiwan. So not only did we
                    want to strengthen relations with Taiwan but we wanted to simplify relations in
                    a way that wouldn't have major substantive impact but which would just make it
                    easier to work the Taiwan side of the issue.</p>
                <p>So we went over this subject for probably a year. It took a long time, partly
                    internal debates, partly White House inertia. Taiwan kept pressing us in terms
                    of what was going to happen. The results were constructive. They were modest,
                    but I think that they were helpful. I can't remember all of them, but we changed
                    the name of the Taiwan office in Washington to “Taiwan Economic and Cultural
                    Relations Office [TECRO].” Now what was it called before?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: It was called, “The Coordination
                        Councifor North American Affairs.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: The Coordination Council for North American Affairs is a real mouthful, and
                    TECRO was a modest improvement. We did that, but it certainly didn't make this
                    office more official. We wouldn't do that, but it gave more sense of what this
                    office was up to. We did approve, in principle, economic cabinet level official
                    visits to Taiwan, which was quite significant. However, such trips had to be
                    related to specific goals. Such trips wouldn't be frequent, but they would be
                    acceptable when they could help us, particularly in the cultural and economic
                    areas. Until then, I believe, the only U.S. Cabinet level official who had ever
                    gone to Taiwan was Carla Hills, at the end of the Bush administration. She was
                    U.S. Trade Representative. We also said that Taiwan officials who have economic
                    functions could meet in U.S. Government offices, even though we said that they
                    couldn't meet U.S. officials in the State Department in Washington, because this
                    would suggest diplomatic overtones.</p>
                <pb facs="0663" n="Page0663"/>
                <p>We decided that we would vigorously support Taiwan membership in international
                    organizations which didn't require statehood. And in the case of those which
                    required statehood, we would press to make sure that their voice could be heard
                    in some fashion, perhaps as observers. In the case of those organizations which
                    didn't require statehood, such as APEC, WTO [World Trade Organization], and
                    other economic agencies, we would push for some Taiwan presence more
                    strongly.</p>
                <p>At the APEC meeting in November, 1993, we also worked out that Taiwan could
                    attend the summit meeting that year. That was also very tough and delicate.
                    Taiwan had already become a member of APEC during the Bush Administration, but
                    it was not a foregone conclusion, when we lifted the level of representation
                    from Foreign Ministers to Heads of State or Heads of Government, that Beijing
                    would settle for Taiwan being present. So we had delicate negotiations conducted
                    by my deputy, Peter Tomsen, in which we arranged for Taiwan to send a
                    representative to the APEC meeting. This representative would not be President
                    Li Teng-hui of Taiwan. This would have been too much for Beijing to accept. The
                    Taiwan representative was, in effect, at the economic cabinet level. This got
                    Taiwan into the APEC summit meeting but at a slightly lower level. It was a
                    rather ingenious compromise which represented a step forward for Taiwan in many
                    ways. They really couldn't have expected to have President Li Teng-hui at that
                    meeting when PRC President Jiang Zemin was there. The PRC didn't like this
                    arrangement, and Taiwan didn't like it either, which shows that it was a good
                    deal. It has lasted ever since.</p>
                <p>I want to underline that I worked very hard at maintaining good relations with
                    Taiwan. I met with their representative, as well as visiting officials very
                    frequently, probably more than any Ambassador in my region. Because of
                    unofficial ties, we couldn't meet in the State Department - I would go across
                    the street to meet in a hotel room; sometimes we had meals at the Four Seasons
                    Hotel in Georgetown. I was dedicated to good relations even as we went ahead
                    with China, because we had moral and historical bonds, we were responsible for
                    Taiwan's security through arms sales and rhetoric and deployments, it was a
                    democracy in contrast to China, we had strong economic links and there was great
                    congressional and media support for Taiwan. I kept Taiwan closely briefed on
                    trips and meetings with China - my own, the President's, Secretary
                    Christopher's, etc. I always supported a robust arms package. Except for the Lee
                    visit interlude, my relations were very cordial, especially with Ding Moushi and
                    Jason Hu.</p>
                <p>In any event, we did all of these things and others for Taiwan. I forget when we
                    announced the results. Of course, it was less than Taiwan had hoped for, but we
                    felt that we had cleaned up a lot of the anomalies, maintained our basic policy,
                    avoided really annoying Beijing all that much, and modestly pleased Taiwan. I
                    think that we came out quite well. The outcome wasn't dramatic. It correctly
                    avoided the extremes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Why did it take so long?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0664" n="Page0664"/>
                <p>LORD: Essentially because people disagreed. Also, frankly, this was a result of
                    inertia in the White House, particularly when there was sensitivity on this
                    issue. It was hard to get meetings scheduled and decisions made.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Were there people arguing that this was going too far,
                    that we were going to hurt Chinese feelings, and this was a bad move?</p>
                <p>LORD: I don't remember that there was a lot of passion in the discussions, to be
                    honest, because it didn't mark a dramatic departure. I don't recall anybody in
                    the Clinton administration pushing for much bolder moves in support of Taiwan. I
                    don't recall anyone saying very passionately that this was going to hurt our
                    relations with Beijing. Thus, you have raised a fair question, why this process
                    took so long. I think that a lot of it was simply a matter of plain inertia in
                    getting the White House to come to grips with the issue. There might have been
                    some nervousness that, maybe, Beijing would be a little annoyed, but I don't
                    recall that this view was held very passionately.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: I ask because, from the outside, I think that the
                    feeling always was that if movement had been faster on this issue, it would have
                    been seen as a really positive, administration move.</p>
                <p>LORD: A very good point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: However, it took so long that
                        everybody'expectations were raised.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's a very good point, and I am glad to record it here. This package of
                    measures involving Taiwan was not revolutionary by any means, of course. We did
                    not review or change our policy on arms sales to Taiwan and the basic policy of
                    unofficial and friendly ties with Taiwan. But if we had done all of this, say,
                    in three or four months, people would have said: “Well, they're looking at the
                    situation affecting Taiwan and they're cleaning up some anomalies. And there's
                    some good steps forward. This is not as much as we 'Taiwan' supporters would
                    like, but it's a step forward. They did it without alienating Beijing. It was a
                    pretty good job.” And I think that in fact was the case.</p>
                <pb facs="0665" n="Page0665"/>
                <p>However, taking a year for action was damaging. Not only were the economic and
                    academic experts on the outside watching this situation, wondering what the hell
                    was going on. Taiwan, of course, was working with Congress to try to pressure on
                    the administration to undertake some bolder moves forward. They had their
                    expectations raised, although, through careful backgrounding of the press, we
                    tried to keep those expectations down. I also tried to keep them down in my
                    meetings with Taiwan representatives. By the time these changes came out, a lot
                    of people probably thought that we had produced a mouse. I think the outcome was
                    better than that. I think that it was partly the delay which caused this
                    misperception.</p>
                <p>Having said that, however, we didn't pay a price of any significance in Beijing,
                    and we got modest kudos from Taiwan. On the whole, Congress thought that we
                    should have done more, but members of Congress grudgingly said that we at least
                    did something.</p>
                <p>Then, in the course of 1994, there was the episode of President Lee Teng-hui of
                    Taiwan wanting to visit the United States in transit to Central America, where
                    he was making a state visit. I believe that it was in 1994. Up till then we
                    hadn't even allowed transit visits by top officials in Taiwan through the United
                    States, bound for another destination. This was due to opposition by Beijing,
                    which had a tremendous, double standard in this regard. They accepted that
                    President Lee Teng-hui could play golf and have official meetings with the
                    leaders of Southeast Asian countries. Beijing would hardly say anything about
                    it. But the U.S. was a different matter, as was Japan.</p>
                <p>In any event, in 1994 President Lee Teng-hui wanted to have a visit, preferably a
                    stopover somewhere in mainland U.S., en route to Central America. He wasn't
                    asking for an official visit to the U.S. at that point. What he wanted was more
                    like a transit visit, but a leisurely transit visit. We split the difference. We
                    decided that we would make the case that, given considerations of geography, it
                    was only natural for him to go through the U.S. en route from Taiwan to Central
                    America. It would have been a little tough and inconvenient not to do so. It was
                    also a matter of airplane distances. You couldn't fly directly from Taiwan to
                    Central America. So on grounds of logistics, convenience, and courtesy, you
                    could make a case for approving this transit visit through the U.S. We knew
                    about Beijing's sensitivities and we decided to have the transit take place in
                    Hawaii. Yes, Hawaii is part of the United States. However, it's in the middle of
                    the Pacific Ocean. A short visit there was not like landing in New York or
                    California. We decided to approve a transit visit which was genuinely a transit
                    visit. It would be a refueling stop. President Lee Teng-hui would come into the
                    VIP lounge while his plane was refueled. I sent out the head of our Taiwan
                    office in the State Department to greet him as a matter of courtesy.</p>
                <pb facs="0666" n="Page0666"/>
                <p>The problem is that this solution didn't work in any direction. The Chinese
                    Government in Beijing was mad and beat up on us, but that was manageable. We
                    could live with that. President Lee Teng-hui, wanting a more high profile visit,
                    said that he wanted to spend a couple of days in Hawaii, play some golf, and
                    meet local people. Instead of Taiwan being grateful that for the first time ever
                    its President had set foot on American soil, it turned out that it was not at
                    all satisfied that the arrangement approved was a step forward compared to what
                    any other American administration had previously permitted. Lee was upset
                    because he just had this refueling stop in Hawaii.</p>
                <p>Lee decided that he would play up this incident and magnify it by not getting off
                    the airplane. As I said, I had sent one of my officers from the Taiwan office to
                    meet and greet him and bring him into the VIP lounge. To this day, like the
                    “Energizer Bunny” [advertisement for a brand of flashlight batteries], I've been
                    trying to stamp out this rumor that we wouldn't let Lee get off the airplane in
                    Hawaii. Of course we wanted him off the plane. We wanted him in the VIP lounge
                    in the airport in Honolulu. By the time my officer met him at the plane, Lee
                    decided that he would get more propaganda advantage by staying on the plane.
                    Then Taiwan put out a statement that we wouldn't let Lee off the plane in
                    Hawaii. We never caught up with that allegation. I became blue in the face,
                    telling every newsman and every Congressman and Senator that I could get my
                    hands on that this allegation was not true. The Taiwan Government keeps saying,
                    to this day, that Lee couldn't get off the airplane in Hawaii. This is total
                    baloney.</p>
                <p>In any event, that was a little forerunner of what came next. Beijing was upset,
                    but this was all right with us. We knew that they weren't going to be pleased.
                    We thought that this was a fair splitting of the difference, balancing security,
                    comfort, and courtesy. We were not being provocative. President Lee didn't have
                    any press conference while he was in Honolulu.</p>
                <p>This incident foreshadowed what happened in 1995. Lee started pressing for an
                    official visit, or at least a working visit. He knew that he couldn't come as a
                    head of state for an official visit. The excuse he used was that he wanted to
                    receive an honorary degree from Cornell University. This was nonsense, because
                    he already had an honorary degree from Cornell. The idea was that he would go up
                    to Cornell University, give a speech, and be feted by his former university.</p>
                <p>Taiwan already had strong lobbyists on Capitol Hill, of course. Taiwan was in
                    second place, just behind Israel and just ahead of Greece in its lobbying effort
                    in Congress. Taiwan also hired a PR [Public Relations] firm, Cassidy. My own
                    view is that Taiwan would have been able to mount a lot of pressure for a travel
                    permit, which is shorthand for Lee being able to come and visit the U.S., even
                    without the PR firm.</p>
                <pb facs="0667" n="Page0667"/>
                <p>They had four million dollars available for this campaign. There were some people
                    in the Taiwan Government who argued against this trip, saying that they should
                    not annoy the Americans and pressure the U.S. Government or go around and lobby
                    Congress, but there were various factions in Taiwan behind this project. Who
                    knows all of the details? In any event, the pressure was intense for us to allow
                    Lee to come to the U.S. and give a speech at Cornell University. This particular
                    episode, along with the reversal of our policy on MFN extension, were the two
                    key events for which the Clinton administration has been criticized on specific
                    aspects of our China policy.</p>
                <p>So we had to deal with the question of the Lee visit. There was a view in the
                    administration, held fairly generally, that Lee should not be allowed to come.
                    You never know when the President was consulted, but he was clearly aware of the
                    matter. The fairly generally held view was that, even though the Chinese
                    Government was being somewhat unreasonable by objecting to an unofficial,
                    private visit by President Lee Teng-hui, the turbulence that would be caused in
                    our relations with Beijing wasn't worth granting a travel permit to Lee. We
                    continued to talk about a transit visit, but when it came to a working visit,
                    this would present a fundamental problem. The basic policy for several
                    administrations had been not to allow visits by high level Taiwan officials. We
                    already had moved on transit visits.</p>
                <p>I remember going up on Capitol Hill on several occasions and just getting
                    lambasted. I was asked: “What the hell is going on? Can't a guy who is a
                    distinguished person, the head of a democracy, come to the United States and
                    visit his 'alma mater'? We're not talking about a high level, high profile
                    visit. We're just talking about letting this poor guy come here and get an
                    honorary degree. Are you going to let these 'pirates' in Beijing pressure you?
                    This guy Lee is a democrat and a friend of the U.S. What the hell is going on
                    here?”</p>
                <p>I remember thinking frankly, during all of the time that I was testifying to the
                    best of my ability, that I privately agreed with the Congressmen. This was an
                    absurd situation. I'm not saying that I argued, within the administration, that
                    Lee should be given a permit. I saw the turbulence building in Beijing and I was
                    not in favor of giving him a trip. However, I felt that, on the merits, it was
                    absurd saying that Lee, as a democratic politician, couldn't get honored by his
                    alma mater. We kept on fighting the Congress and telling the PRC Embassy and
                    Beijing that it was our fundamental policy not to have a visit to the U.S. by
                    such a high level official of the Taiwan Government. This position was also
                    relayed in a meeting in April, 1995, which Secretary Christopher had with PRC
                    Foreign Minister Qian Qichen at which he said that our fundamental policy was
                    still not to allow visits to the U.S. by high level Taiwan officials. However,
                    Christopher also said that we were having a difficult time convincing the U.S.
                    Congress that this was the right course, and the pressure was building up.
                    Understandably, Qian Qichen reported the first part of Christopher's remarks
                    back to PRC President Jiang Zemin and others that the U.S. continued to oppose
                    such visits. Either he didn't report the second part of Christopher's remarks or
                    didn't give appropriate weight to these Congressional pressures. Maybe Qian
                    Qichen thought that, whatever these pressures, we would just ignore them.</p>
                <pb facs="0668" n="Page0668"/>
                <p>I'm not trying to say that Secretary Christopher was trying to tell Qian Qichen
                    that we were going to reverse our policy on visits by high-ranking Taiwan
                    officials. The PRC authorities, I think, were caught by surprise, but there was
                    a lot of foreshadowing by Christopher to Qian Qichen of the ultimate decision,
                    based on the fact that there were great difficulties in the way of continuing
                    this policy. When we did reverse this policy on visits to the U.S. by
                    high-ranking Taiwan officials, Qian Qichen didn't say that he was personally
                    embarrassed. PRC President Jiang Zemin was embarrassed, to the extent that he
                    looked as if he had been outflanked by Taiwan at a time when Jiang was trying to
                    consolidate his position. This was a very sensitive issue, which was
                    embarrassing both for President Jiang and for Foreign Minister Qian. Qian was
                    identified with dealing with the U.S. and for having gotten these assurances
                    that there would be no further visits to the U.S. by high-level Taiwan
                    officials. It was one of the reasons why Foreign Minister Qian was so hard-line
                    during the later Taiwan Straits missile crisis. He needed to show that he could
                    be firm on Taiwan and so protect his flank. The same was true with Jiang.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the pressure kept up on this proposed visit to the U.S. by President Lee
                    Teng-hui. Congress voted unanimously, without dissent in the House of
                    Representatives, to allow Lee to come for a short visit. In the Senate, I think,
                    the vote was 97 to 1. These were “sense of the Congress” resolutions without
                    legal effect. However, the votes were overwhelming and were a clear message to
                    the administration. The only holdout in the Senate was Senator Bennett Johnson
                    [Democrat, Louisiana], who voted both out of conviction, to avoid upsetting
                    Beijing, and because of various oil interests and so forth. This took guts, I
                    must say, no matter what his views were. So we got to the point where we felt
                    that Congress would be so outraged if we held out on this issue that it might
                    tamper with the Taiwan Relations Act and might enforce other things with respect
                    to Taiwan which could really hurt our policy toward Beijing. The media was also
                    generally beating up on us. The Cassidy firm had been very effective, but these
                    pressures would have been there anyway.</p>
                <p>We also felt that the PRC Government was overreacting, of course, but basically
                    we knew that continuing to decline to issue a traveler's permit to Lee Teng-hui
                    was going to cause huge problems. On the other hand, we knew that we had told
                    the PRC Government that we would hang in there, so it was very awkward for
                    us.</p>
                <p>Now, I was traveling overseas in May, 1995, so I didn't get directly involved in
                    the last few days of debate in Washington on the Lee visit. I don't know exactly
                    what I would have done if I had been in Washington at the time. However, I want
                    to make very clear that I knew through back channel messages from my deputy, the
                    acting Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, as I was
                    traveling, what was happening and that we were going to reverse our policy and
                    let Lee Teng-hui visit the United States. I did not oppose that decision.</p>
                <pb facs="0669" n="Page0669"/>
                <p>In retrospect, if I had this to do all over again, I think that we should have
                    agreed to grant Lee a traveler's permit from the beginning. We would then have
                    avoided the flip flop in the eyes of the PRC Government, although they still
                    would have been outraged at the decision. However, on the merits, I think that
                    Lee Teng-hui should have been allowed to make a private, unofficial visit, and
                    then we should have been prepared to tough it out with the PRC. Another thing
                    that we should have done, and I'll get to this, is that we should have been much
                    more air tight on the speech that Lee was going to give at Cornell
                    University.</p>
                <p>Q: By any chance, during the arguments on this issue within the administration,
                    was the case for letting the Shah of Iran into the United States for medical
                    treatment brought up as something that might have been a parallel?</p>
                <p>LORD: No, I don't recall that. By the way, I happen to have been in favor of
                    allowing the Shah of Iran to be brought into the U.S. for medical treatment. But
                    that parallel...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just wondering whether that case was considered.
                        There is certain symmetry...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: In terms of our relations with another country, I understand that, but I
                    don't recall that that argument was used. Basically, it was the impact on
                    Beijing and the pressure on Beijing, versus the impact of the pressures from
                    Congress. And, of course, there was the feeling that the PRC Government was
                    really overreacting on this issue. However, in the end, we were also concerned
                    that Congress might pass legislation which would really tie our hands on Taiwan
                    and China. As I have said, these were incredibly overwhelming votes in both
                    houses of Congress.</p>
                <p>There also was the question of timing and the President, and I'll never sort this
                    matter out. When he announced the decision on the travel permit for President
                    Lee Teng-hui, President Clinton expressed the view along the lines of: “I
                    believe in freedom of travel. Why can't the President of Taiwan come to the
                    United States privately?” This seemed to suggest that Clinton didn't know what
                    American positions on proposed visits had been. He finally seemed to conclude
                    that our position had been unreasonable and that we were going to change it. I
                    can't tell you how much President Clinton consulted with Tony Lake [National
                    Security Adviser] and Sandy Berger [Deputy National Security Adviser] as he went
                    along. However, it was such a visible issue that I can't believe that the
                    President wasn't in favor of holding the line. He just changed his mind, and put
                    emphasis on the freedom of travel and other considerations when he announced his
                    decision. Of course, the Congressional pressures were key for him.</p>
                <pb facs="0670" n="Page0670"/>
                <p>Of course, we tried to package this decision for the PRC Government as best we
                    could. What we told them, and what we told Taiwan at the same time that we did
                    this, was that this visit was going to be at the lowest key possible. So we
                    worked out that President Lee would hold no press conferences. He would land in
                    California and go directly to Ithaca, New York, [where Cornell University is
                    located] and not even go through New York City. Of course, not Washington, but
                    not even New York City. He would go directly to Ithaca. He would not be met by
                    any U.S. Government officials, although we would have my Taiwan Country Director
                    accompanying him, partly to keep Lee under control, to work with their people,
                    and make sure that he didn't do something that would be awkward.</p>
                <p>There were Congressmen and Senators who wanted to go up to Cornell and meet
                    President Lee. We couldn't do anything about that. However, he would not meet
                    with any administration official, there would be no press conference, and he
                    would not even go through New York City. We were assured by Benjamin Lu, the
                    Taiwan representative in Washington, that Lee's speech would be low key, would
                    be non-political, and would cover economic reforms in Taiwan. So, in retrospect,
                    the other thing that we should have done was to obtain the text of his proposed
                    speech in advance. I know that we attempted very vigorously to get details of
                    the speech from the Taiwan representative in Washington, but without success.
                    This should have made us suspicious.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, and I didn't argue this at the time, we should have given him the
                    visa from the beginning, so we wouldn't have had a public flip flop on the
                    issue. We wouldn't have had these pressures from Congress and the awkward
                    reversal of policy. This would have helped modestly with Beijing. In the context
                    of air tightness, on the trip being unofficial and low key, which we managed to
                    pull off on other things, besides the speech, we should have said that we would
                    only approve the issuance of a travel permit for Lee if we could see the text of
                    the speech in advance. If he didn't like this condition, he didn't have to come
                    to the U.S. at all.</p>
                <p>I am convinced that the Lee speech created a major problem. The PRC Government
                    was going to scream and shout, even without the speech. However, the fact is
                    that during most of the Lee visit, we kept the press away, we limited his
                    itinerary, and we explained all of this to the PRC Chinese. They did not react
                    all that strongly during the lead up to the Lee visit and even during the first
                    couple of days of it. The reaction was strong, but not in terms of the decibel
                    count that I was familiar with in terms of the Chinese rhetoric. Then Lee gave
                    his speech. In his speech he had countless references to the “Republic of China
                    on Taiwan, in addition to other provocations.” He totally double crossed us. Of
                    course, the PRC Chinese went ballistic. I must say that I went ballistic as
                    well, as did others in the U.S. Government. After all, on this issue President
                    Clinton had stuck his neck out, risking our relationship with the PRC, and then
                    Lee gave a big political speech on Taiwan.</p>
                <pb facs="0671" n="Page0671"/>
                <p>As a result, on my own, I just refused thereafter to receive Benjamin Lu, the
                    Taiwan representative. I was not personally given any instructions to do this
                    and I didn't consult anyone. For a few months he had absolutely no access to me.
                    I was the highest level official in the State Department that he was allowed to
                    see and I had been seeing him regularly. Because of his performance on the
                    visit, however, and to register our displeasure on the speech, I just ignored
                    him. He was finally recalled to Taiwan. I would like to think that I had
                    something to do with it. He is a nice man but ineffectual. However, he
                    personally could have been more helpful. He was either weak or disingenuous. He
                    had been lobbying Congress and going around us, without attempting to discuss
                    the matter with us. He wasn't respected in Taiwan, anyway. Everyone thought that
                    his appointment to Washington was somewhat puzzling to begin with. I was
                    therefore sending a message to Taiwan about our unhappiness over this issue but
                    also our unhappiness with his behavior. As a result, he was withdrawn from
                    Washington, but not just because of me. But the Taiwan Government saw that he
                    had no access to the State Department, and this contributed to its decision to
                    withdraw him from Washington.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we were very tough with Taiwan afterwards. Also we went back to Beijing
                    on it, but in any case the damage was done. PRC President Jiang Zemin and
                    Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in particular thought that they had been
                    embarrassed on this matter. I don't remember all of the things that happened,
                    but the PRC Government cut off some trips and exchanges. They withdrew their
                    Ambassador from Washington, and relations got very frosty just when we had been
                    making some progress on our relationship. I think that the PRC began its first
                    military exercise [in the Taiwan Straits] in summer, 1995, not long after the
                    Lee visit.</p>
                <p>I also paid close attention to Hong Kong throughout my tenure. The British colony
                    was to return to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997, after I left office. I
                    thought it was important to underscore American support for Hong Kong's future
                    autonomy and freedom under Chinese rule. I enthusiastically supported Governor
                    Chris Patten's efforts - and tangle with Beijing - to introduce some elements of
                    political choice and democracy. This would constitute a glass ceiling which the
                    Chinese would have to break if they wanted to roll back reform. Of course, the
                    British were late at doing this - Patten had the courage and foresight to do
                    this whereas all his predecessors had essentially kow-towed to Beijing. Some of
                    them, and some so-called China experts in the U.S., criticized Patten for this.
                    I strongly supported him, as did our government. I would always see him, usually
                    at a private working breakfast on my several trips there to show the flag.</p>
                <p>I would also meet with the Chinese representatives (NCNA) and urge tolerance in
                    China's self-interest. Christopher and I would also raise this in our meetings
                    with Chinese officials elsewhere. In Hong Kong I would also meet with American
                    businesspeople, Hong Kong business types, and Hong Kong legislators, including
                    democracy activists, like Martin Lee. I would include support for Hong Kong in
                    various speeches and hold press conferences there, as elsewhere in Asia.</p>
                <pb facs="0672" n="Page0672"/>
                <p>At any rate they fired some missiles and had some military exercises. We reacted
                    to this, saying that these exercises were not helpful, but I don't recall any
                    high level protest, since they were not particularly provocative.XXIII. STATE
                    DEPARTMENT ASSISTANT SECRETARY - CHINA (1996-1997)</p>
                <p>In 1995 we got MFN status renewed for China by a fairly significant majority
                    despite the controversy that came up every year. We kept working on other
                    issues. However, as we reached the beginning of 1996, it looked as if we faced a
                    real nightmare. This was even before the Taiwan Missile Crisis heated up again.
                    We had been able to improve relations somewhat with the PRC but we discovered
                    that there was a whole minefield ahead of us. The Chinese were sending ring
                    magnets to Pakistan, which helped Pakistan develop their nuclear capability.
                    Consequently, we slapped on sanctions because of that.</p>
                <p>We had very tough negotiations on intellectual property rights. American business
                    interests were losing billions of dollars each year because of pirating
                    [unauthorized copying] by the PRC Chinese of CDs [Compact Discs], VCRs [Video
                    Cassette Recorders], computer software, pharmaceutical products patented in the
                    U.S., and so forth.</p>
                <p>In March, 1996, we had coming up the annual tussle in Geneva over a resolution
                    critiquing Chinese human rights. This was always a source of irritation between
                    us and Beijing. The MFN extension would come up after that in May-June, and the
                    human rights issue wasn't going well. There was still the chill left over from
                    the withdrawal of the PRC Ambassador from Washington in the wake of the Lee
                    visit, although he would have returned by then. I don't remember when exactly.
                    However, there was a basic chill on exchanges with the PRC. So the relationship
                    between the U.S. and the PRC Chinese was not in very good shape early in 1996
                    and difficult issues lay ahead.</p>
                <p>With my encouragement Secretary Christopher - of course with the full agreement
                    and encouragement of the White House - said that we have to look at our whole
                    policy toward China and see how the hell we are going to get back on track in
                    terms of our relationship and get through all of these minefields. I don't
                    recall whether it was January, 1996, or it may even have been in the fall of
                    1995. At any rate, we began a process of intensive, strategic reviews, both in
                    the State Department and at the White House. Either Sandy Berger would chair
                    meetings at the White House or Christopher chaired meetings at the State
                    Department, with Sandy Berger or Tony Lake coming over to the State
                    Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0673" n="Page0673"/>
                <p>The point I am making is that this contradicts stories that this was essentially
                    a Christopher-led operation or a White House one. Meetings were held at the
                    White House and the State Department and there was total cooperation. Everyone
                    felt that we had to see how the hell we were going to get through this minefield
                    of issues. So we not only looked at specifics about what we would do about IPR,
                    what we would do about nuclear non-proliferation, and what we would do about
                    human rights. We also considered our approach to all of these issues, generally.
                    It was agreed, among other things, that we really would try to make a much more
                    aggressive effort to engage in a strategic dialogue with the PRC, even as we
                    referred to individual issues.</p>
                <p>I should add that at this time Liu Haoqui was Tony Lake's equivalent within the
                    Chinese hierarchy as National Security Adviser, although not as powerful,
                    reporting directly to Lee Peng [PRC Prime Minister]. He was also Vice Foreign
                    Minister. He had been an America hand for some time, including when I was in
                    Beijing as Ambassador. Anyway, Liu was coming to visit the PRC Embassy in
                    Washington in March, 1996, to talk to all of the PRC Consuls General and the PRC
                    Ambassador. This was a sort of “Chiefs of Mission meeting,” whatever they called
                    it. So, with close coordination between the State Department and the White
                    House, we requested that Liu spend some time, not only with the usual suspects
                    in the State and Defense Departments but also with the National Security
                    Adviser. We arranged a day-long retreat and to have a strategic dialogue with
                    him.</p>
                <p>This was done with Christopher's agreement with the understanding that I would
                    sit in on all the Lake-Liu talks. The PRC Government clearly appreciated that
                    there was full coordination within the U.S. Government, with Secretary
                    Christopher keeping up his vigorous efforts with the PRC Foreign Minister, which
                    he did, throughout this period.</p>
                <p>Lo and behold, on the day Liu arrived in Washington, Friday, March 7, 1996, the
                    PRC fired missiles that landed on either side of Taiwan. One missile landed off
                    one port in Taiwan and two others, I believe, landed off a second port. This
                    incident greatly escalated the tension in the Taiwan Straits. As I previously
                    mentioned, the PRC had already held military exercises in the area, and tensions
                    were building up. That was the other development which was already making things
                    look pretty grim in early 1996.</p>
                <p>So that particular time - March 1996 - was clearly the low point in U.S.-China
                    relations during the first Clinton term. All of these factors came together,
                    with the missile crisis being the latest and the most dramatic.</p>
                <pb facs="0674" n="Page0674"/>
                <p>As we looked toward the Liu visit, we had decided not to change our policy toward
                    the PRC, but to implement it much more aggressively in terms of a strategic
                    dialogue, looking ahead at all of these minefields and the continuing problems
                    we were having. We were engaged in mapping out what we would do on each of these
                    issues. But also we tried to think of ways that we could do things the PRC might
                    find positive, in addition to pressing them on things that they would find
                    difficult. So a lot of discussions on strategy went on, as I say, between the
                    State Department and the White House. Secretary Christopher chaired most of the
                    key sessions, unlike what is stated in this “Washington Post” article, which
                    emphasized the role of the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might mention why we are mentioning the “Washington
                        Post.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, as we speak here in late June, 1998, there has been a two-part series
                    of articles in the “Washington Post” which essentially could have been written
                    by Tony Lake and his new partner, Rothkop, who used to work in the Department of
                    Commerce. These articles essentially said that U.S. China policy during the
                    Clinton administration was screwed up by the State Department until Tony Lake
                    rescued it. That's what I'm referring to.</p>
                <p>I will give Lake his due, as we go ahead, you can be certain. It's just that this
                    is a one-sided view. I'm not saying that Lake wrote these articles. I'm just
                    saying that these articles contain a lot of spinning, in the sense that they are
                    a very partial view, if you look at them from the historical perspective. The
                    facts are that both Lake (with me by his side) and Christopher worked on
                    improving our relations with China in 1996. There was total coordination in our
                    government. It was natural, and healthy for the National Security Advisor to get
                    more involved (until then, it was mostly his deputy, Berger), but this was done
                    in close concert with Christopher and me. Together we did a very skillful job on
                    China in 1996 and by the end of the year relations were much more positive.</p>
                <p>We had arranged for Liu's visit to begin on a Friday night with an informal
                    dinner at the State Department, hosted by Secretary of State Christopher. This
                    was to make clear, as Liu went off the next day for a full day's meeting with
                    Tony Lake and me, that the State Department was still heavily involved in U.S.
                    foreign policy. So as part of a united front, Lake was going to come over to the
                    Department, and they were going to have a joint dinner with Liu.</p>
                <pb facs="0675" n="Page0675"/>
                <p>When we got word of the PRC missile firings, we decided to add Secretary of
                    Defense Perry to the discussions we were going to have with Liu. I don't believe
                    that we included the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen Shalikashvili.
                    So the dinner included Secretary of State Christopher; Secretary of Defense
                    Perry; Tony Lake, National Security Adviser; myself; and Jeff Bader, the PRC
                    Country Director, who was note taker. I can't remember whether Sandy Berger was
                    there. It was a small dinner, with about six or seven of us on the U.S. side. We
                    decided to do a full court press, of course, on the PRC missile firings. This
                    was now required before opening up a strategic dialogue on the next day. This
                    had now been overtaken by the PRC missile firings, which we had to address
                    first. We weren't going to cancel the Liu visit. However, we had to carry out
                    our policy of having a strategic dialogue against the backdrop of firmness in
                    view of this Chinese provocation.</p>
                <p>It was agreed that first Secretary of Defense Perry, then Secretary of State
                    Christopher, and then National Security Adviser Lake would speak, although I am
                    not entirely certain of the order in which they spoke. I know that Secretary
                    Perry went first. Each of the three speakers was to deliver a tough message over
                    dinner. We worked closely together on this. In effect, Perry, and this has been
                    covered in the article in the “Washington Post,” said that what Beijing had done
                    could result in grave consequences. This was a pretty heavily loaded term. He
                    said that this could lead to a possible conflict with the United States. He
                    likened what the PRC had done, firing missiles North and South of Taiwan, as a
                    kind of bracketing artillery fire, where you fire to one side and then to the
                    other side so that you can zoom in on the actual target. He used that image,
                    which was strong language. And Christopher and Lake also used strong
                    language.</p>
                <p>Our clear impression was that Liu was totally surprised by the timing of the
                    missile firings, if not the missile firings themselves. I'm sure he was not
                    pleased that this was the way that he was starting his visit to Washington. Liu,
                    of course, was firm. He is always firm. He can be jovial at times. He was
                    personally very friendly to me and my wife on many occasions when we were in
                    China, so I have personal respect for him. However, he can be very feisty in his
                    discussions in defendinChinese interests and attacking the U.S. So he was tough.
                    However, I felt that, by Chinese standards, he was on the defensive, and his
                    decibel level was under control. He clearly felt awkward about this situation,
                    although he didn't say that, of course.</p>
                <p>So we basically spent the whole dinner on this one subject. We made some
                    references to the view that we hoped to move ahead with our relationship. We
                    noted that Liu would be meeting with Tony Lake throughout all of the following
                    day. However, we indicated that we thought that this was a hell of a way to
                    start important discussions.</p>
                <pb facs="0676" n="Page0676"/>
                <p>On the next day there was a lot of snow on the ground, and it was cold. We drove
                    down to Pamela Harriman's estate in Virginia. It is called “Pelican Estate” and
                    it is secluded. I forget the exact town it is near. There were four of us on our
                    side, including Tony Lake, Bob Suettinger of the NSC staff, Jeff Bader, and
                    myself. We had worked closely with Tony Lake in setting this up. We worked very
                    well together. Tony Lake did an extremely good job and deserves a lot of credit.
                    He helped a lot. He had not played that much of a role on China policy, as Sandy
                    Berger had. Now he was getting more involved on some of these Asian issues,
                    generally and specifically on China. It's true that Lake had been advised by
                    some outsiders that the White House should get more involved, including Tony
                    Lake personally, as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger had formerly played
                    key roles on China issues. Lake should have been doing the same thing here. In
                    years gone by Kissinger and Haig had urged the importance of our having a
                    strategic dialogue with China, and the importance of having the White House
                    involved in it.</p>
                <p>So we carefully scripted how we would approach the meeting with Liu. We sat in a
                    comfortable living room. There were four people on the Chinese side, plus one
                    interpreter. We sat around a fireplace and then went into the dining room for a
                    working luncheon. Following this, we came back to the living room and sat around
                    the fireplace. The discussion lasted roughly from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, including
                    lunch. Our strategy was the classical one to follow at a time like this. First,
                    we had to repeat the warnings and the grave concerns expressed at dinner on the
                    night before, regarding the Chinese missile firings at Taiwan. We began with
                    that.</p>
                <p>Tony Lake also made references to words that we heard from Charles Freeman about
                    a potential Chinese threat against us (Los Angeles specifically), if we had a
                    nuclear confrontation. We said that we didn't know how authoritative these words
                    were, but we didn't like what we were hearing. So there was some tough talk at
                    the beginning, reiterating the points made the night before.</p>
                <p>We then went over to what was supposed to be a more constructive discussion. We
                    decided to do that in three parts. They were carefully scripted but were also
                    projected to the Chinese in advance. The first part of the presentation was more
                    conceptual, philosophical, and strategic, describing two great powers heading
                    into the next century, that is, how we could work together, why that is
                    important, and how we see China. We said that we want to see China as a strong,
                    stable, prosperous, and open society. We weren't out to contain China, divide
                    it, or subvert it. We thought that it was in our interest for China to have
                    these attributes. We would not oppose China in developing such a society and,
                    indeed, would work with it. However, we said that we were also hard-headed and
                    would defend our interests. We would maintain our force levels and our
                    alliances. We would be firm in negotiating. We had interests and would stand up
                    for our values. This was a philosophical discussion of our approach and why it
                    was important to have a strategic dialogue with China. We sketched out some
                    areas where we could work more effectively together and give some content to
                    this approach.</p>
                <pb facs="0677" n="Page0677"/>
                <p>Some of the areas involved ranged from Korea to Cambodia, regional security
                    dialogues, APEC, economic questions, Chinese admission to the WTO [World Trade
                    Organization], and environmental questions, crime and narcotics. All of these
                    things have become more familiar today. We laid most of those out on this
                    occasion, as I recall.</p>
                <p>So we started with this conceptual, philosophical, and strategic framework of a
                    rather positive nature, after the initial pounding about Chinese missile firings
                    in the vicinity of Taiwan.</p>
                <p>Then in the second part of the day we took on the tough issues. We didn't want to
                    start with the negative side. We wanted to set out a strategic, positive
                    framework within which to take up these tough issues. We also didn't want to end
                    up with negative issues but rather on a positive note. So we put the tough
                    issues in the middle. We covered human rights, trade, nuclear non-proliferation,
                    Taiwan, and so on.</p>
                <p>Then we ended up in part three by indicating where we could go on some of the
                    issues which we had sketched in the agenda earlier in the presentation. We
                    outlined some suggestions on how we could make progress on troublesome issues
                    such as nuclear non-proliferation, human rights, and some other matters, as well
                    as reference back to regional security, economics, and some of the other
                    positive aspects. We also proposed the intensification of exchanges between the
                    two countries at various levels, and, I believe, some foreshadowing, without
                    locking ourselves into it, of a possible summit meeting. We indicated that our
                    Presidents had met on occasion and we suggested that this might be a good
                    idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: President Clinton had not yet made a state visit to
                        China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No. He hadn't made a visit to China of any kind. The lasvisit had been made
                    by President Bush in 1989.</p>
                <p>That, basically, was the approach we made to the Chinese. Tony Lake handled
                    himself very well. There was a firm discussion, particularly in the middle part
                    of the agenda. However, it was clearly constructive, and, obviously, the Chinese
                    liked the fact that this was a discussion at the strategic level of two great
                    powers. Lake and Liu livened the discussion with some humor at times, and so on.
                    On the whole, it was the most extensive discussion and the most strategic that
                    we had with the Chinese during the first Clinton term.</p>
                <pb facs="0678" n="Page0678"/>
                <p>It was the best such discussion that we had had because previous meetings,
                    whoever was conducting them for the U.S., lasted for only an hour here or two
                    hours there. We never had more than a two or two and a half hour meeting. For
                    this meeting we purposely got out of our Washington offices and from within
                    range of telephones. We knew that we had seven hours to discuss these matters.
                    It was an important step, particularly since we had reached the nadir of our
                    relationship at that point. I believe that this meeting helped set the stage for
                    an improvement in our relations thereafter. It was a turning point. I'll get
                    into more detail on that.</p>
                <p>We still have to comment on what the Chinese were up to at this point. Do you
                    want me to answer any questions about this meeting, which was held, I believe,
                    near Middleburg, Virginia?</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Could you say something about what the Chinese raised
                    with you when you asked them for this meeting? How serious were the discussions
                    which Chas. Freeman had with General Xiong?</p>
                <p>LORD: It depends on whom you were talking to. Chas. Freeman likes to think that
                    these discussions were of fundamental importance. I think that that's baloney.
                    It was vague, at least the way we heard it at the time. It seems to have gotten
                    more precise since then.</p>
                <p>But I think that we all felt that there was enough there that we had to respond
                    and take note of it. We didn't want to inflate its importance. Obviously, it
                    wasn't coming...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was supposed to be coming out of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Basically the Chinese were alleged to have said more or less as follows.
                    They said: “Look, we're not worried if we get into some tension and potential
                    conflict with the United States. By the way, we have nuclear weapons, too. In
                    the event of a real confrontation we don't think that the Americans are going to
                    give up Los Angeles in exchange for Taiwan.”</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: They basically said that in the 1950s and 1960s it was
                    possible for the United States to eliminate China with nuclear weapons. However,
                    times have changed, and the United States would not be willing to sacrifice Los
                    Angeles for Taiwan.</p>
                <p>LORD: So this was unpleasant, but it wasn't so authoritative that we wanted to
                    give this comment the dignity of an official, Chinese position. We also wanted
                    to let them know that we had noticed the comment. I wonder whether this exchange
                    was quite as important as Freeman suggested. Nevertheless, he felt that he had
                    the obligation to report it, and it was of potential significance. So we
                    addressed that matter head on at the Saturday session as well, but not at great
                    length. Does that answer your question?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0679" n="Page0679"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: On the very next day we met in Secretary of Defense Perry's office on the
                    Taiwan missile crisis. This was Saturday, March 8. We were, of course, very
                    concerned about Chinese actions. We felt that, obviously, China was seeking to
                    intimidate Taiwan and influence the Presidential election there. There still was
                    residual fallout not only from the visit of President Lee Teng-hui to the U.S.,
                    but from Taiwanese diplomacy, which was trying to get more international
                    profile. Taiwan was trying to get into the UN, in response to growing
                    independence sentiment in Taiwan. Beijing, in its heavy-handed way, was trying
                    to prevent this.</p>
                <p>This shows how little the PRC leaders understood about democracy. All they did
                    was to increase Lee's margin of victory in the Taiwan presidential elections and
                    make many people on Taiwan very angry. The Chinese also scared countries in East
                    Asia. On the other hand, in effect the PRC sent a message to Taiwan that,
                    although they can't attack Taiwan in an amphibious way, they could lob in a few
                    missiles. They could affect the Taiwan stock market, investment, and so forth.
                    So the PRC didn't lose totally on this. I'm sure that the PRC rationalized it in
                    their own mind that their tough muscling around had some positive impact.</p>
                <p>In any event, we met in Secretary Perry's office on Saturday morning, March 8. I
                    remember that I went over to the Georgetown section of Washington and joined
                    Secretary Christopher at his home and then rode over with him to the Pentagon
                    for this meeting. The Americans present were Perry, Christopher, and myself - I
                    was the only sub-cabinet official there - John Deutch, the Director of Central
                    Intelligence, was there, as was JCS Chairman General Shalikashvili, and either
                    Tony Lake or Sandy Berger from the National Security Council staff. Probably
                    Lake, but maybe both of them were there. I just can't remember.</p>
                <p>Perry's office had charts on display for the meeting. Perry had Gen Shali do the
                    presentation. Basically, there was no debate. The question was what, if
                    anything, we could do to deter Chinese use of force. Neither we nor Taiwan had
                    any intelligence that the PRC was going to use force at that time against
                    Taiwan, beyond firing a few missiles and using intimidation. We had no evidence
                    that the PRC was going to hit an uninhabited island with a missile or harass
                    shipping. Certainly, the PRC was not going to attack Taiwan if they didn't even
                    have the capability to attack one of the offshore islands. As far as we knew,
                    none of this was within the PRC range of capabilities. Our best judgment was
                    that the PRC wanted to engage in psychological and political warfare to
                    intimidate Taiwan and send a signal about the sensitivity of this issue, from
                    the PRC point of view. Taiwan intelligence agreed with that view.</p>
                <pb facs="0680" n="Page0680"/>
                <p>Having said that, it was agreed that there was a five or ten percent chance that
                    we were wrong. The PRC might take aggressive action at the lower level, namely,
                    for example, seize an uninhabited offshore island or lob a missile at some
                    uninhabited territory. The PRC might possibly go after one of the larger,
                    offshore islands, although we believed that they couldn't take even one of the
                    offshore islands without bloody fighting, and they would have to prepare to do
                    that well in advance. We knew that the PRC wouldn't attack Taiwan itself,
                    because they couldn't do so. Furthermore, that would be incredibly
                    provocative.</p>
                <p>There was a danger that our intelligence was wrong and that the PRC might just do
                    something of a modest nature which would still be very humiliating and which
                    would make it very difficult for us to decide what to do in response. Or,
                    through miscalculation, the PRC might stumble into action. Either a missile
                    misfire could hit a populated center, or harassment of shipping could result in
                    a collision or some incident in the air. Or something could happen just
                    inadvertently. There was unanimous agreement, and Secretary Perry stressed this
                    point, “an ounce of prevention is worth an awful lot of cure.” Our choices after
                    the Chinese had done something would be much more difficult, even after an
                    accident, however modest it was, than if we deterred them from the beginning. So
                    the feeling was that we had to have a demonstration, beyond the rhetoric that we
                    had been applying, both privately, through diplomatic channels, and publicly,
                    when we strongly criticized what the Chinese were up to.</p>
                <p>We had to show the Chinese that we were serious. Furthermore, we wanted to show
                    our allies and friends in the East Asian region that we were reliable partners.
                    We wanted to remind Beijing that we were number one in terms of military power.
                    We also, of course, wanted to reassure Taiwan about its security concerns. We
                    wanted to show Beijing that provocation doesn't pay and is dangerous. And, of
                    course, we were concerned about our domestic front in Congress, whose views we
                    shared completely. Many members of Congress were concerned about Taiwan and were
                    angry about what Beijing was up to. For all of these reasons there was a
                    unanimous view in this group which met in Secretary Perry's office that we
                    needed to do something significant.</p>
                <p>We had the usual aircraft carrier deployed in the region. I think that the USS
                    INDEPENDENCE had been undergoing repairs and overhaul in Yokohama. I guess that
                    by the time of this meeting it had already sailed, with its accompanying battle
                    group. We made sure that it moved close to the region of the Taiwan Straits.
                    This key decision, by itself, would get some attention from Beijing, in the
                    sense that this was a carrier deployed in the Pacific. When we moved it closer
                    to Taiwan, this was significant but it was not particularly dramatic. We didn't
                    want to take any half measures. So we purposely decided, again without anybody
                    disagreeing, to deploy another aircraft carrier, along with its accompanying
                    escorts, to the area, which would really make our point. This would marshal the
                    biggest fighting force in the Western Pacific for a long time.</p>
                <pb facs="0681" n="Page0681"/>
                <p>We had to get this second carrier, which I think was the USS ENTERPRISE, from the
                    Indian Ocean or Persian Gulf, so this carrier had to be replaced from somewhere
                    else. Of course, it took some time for it to get to the vicinity of Taiwan. The
                    very fact that we were deploying a second carrier would - did - get everyone's
                    attention. So it was agreed, and Sandy Berger or Tony Lake, whoever was there,
                    and I guess it was Lake, said that he would take this matter back for
                    presidential approval, which he got by that night. We agreed that we wanted the
                    word of this redeployment of the second carrier to get out quickly. We didn't
                    want to be overly high profile, but it was important for the word to get out
                    rather quickly to have an impact on Beijing and U.S. domestic audiences. After
                    all, the information about the PRC missile firings had spread quickly and was
                    causing a great stir.</p>
                <p>Secretary Christopher was due to be on the TV program, “Meet the Press,” which
                    was one of the Sunday talk shows on March 9. We decided at the State Department
                    to have Secretary Christopher handle the announcement during this program. I
                    don't know whether we checked with anyone else on this, but it had been agreed
                    by everyone who had been at the meeting in Perry's office that we would get the
                    word out. Christopher had taken enough of a beating on China policy and deserved
                    better than the treatment he had received. So, it was appropriate for him to
                    take the public lead on this key move. So he got the word out. I forget the
                    exact phrasing he used on “Meet the Press.”</p>
                <p>We were working on this matter on both sides of the Straits. With Beijing, of
                    course, the most dramatic signal was the deployment of these aircraft carriers
                    to the Taiwan Straits. Both publicly and privately in our rhetoric, we were
                    telling Beijing not to use force and get into a conflict with grave consequences
                    and so forth. At the same time we were providing them both for real as well as
                    for face reasons, evidence that we were not changing our policy toward Taiwan.
                    Our policy was still a One China policy. We assured Beijing of continuity. We
                    also told Beijing that we were telling Taiwan that they shouldn't be overly
                    provocative in their diplomacy. So we sent a double barreled message to Beijing,
                    that is, aircraft carriers, “tough rhetoric,” and “don't use force” coupled with
                    assurance that we were sticking with our China policy. We were disturbed with
                    what Beijing had done but we weren't going to change our policy on One China. We
                    were urging Taiwan to cool it. We were encouraging Beijing and Taiwan to have
                    direct talks across the Taiwan Straits. We did not put the carriers in the
                    Strait itself but kept them nearby.</p>
                <pb facs="0682" n="Page0682"/>
                <p>With Taiwan, of course, the deployment of the carriers was reassuring and a great
                    boost to morale. It made the point. We also filled this in with appropriate
                    rhetoric. We told them that we found what Beijing was doing was unacceptable.
                    However, we told Taiwan that we didn't like Taiwan's being overly provocative in
                    its diplomacy, because this might drag the U.S. into a conflict. We said that we
                    didn't think that this would serve Taiwan's interest because tensions in the
                    Taiwan Straits don't serve Taiwan's security or the economy of Taiwan. Recalling
                    President Lee's speech at Cornell University and Taiwan's direct dealings with
                    the U.S. Congress, we were not going to let them outflank us. As for Taiwan's
                    international diplomacy, the U.S. would support Taiwan's efforts to get into
                    international organizations which do not require statehood for entry. In fact, I
                    don't recall whether we tried to discourage Taiwan from its campaign to get into
                    the UN but we did say that we didn't want Taiwan to act in a provocative way. We
                    told Taiwan that they could see that we continued to ensure its security, and
                    they could see what we were doing with the deployment of the aircraft carriers
                    to the Western Pacific. In return, Taiwan owed us some restraint.</p>
                <p>Specifically, we had Peter Tarnoff, the Undersecretary of State for Political
                    Affairs, and Sandy Berger, Deputy National Security Adviser, meet secretly at a
                    hotel in New York with Ding Moushi, who had been the Taiwan representative in
                    Washington during the early part of the Clinton administration. He was now a
                    direct adviser to the Taiwan Government on national security affairs, although
                    not the national security adviser to President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan. We knew
                    that he had a direct pipeline to President Lee and was also an able guy, unlike
                    Benjamin Lu, then representative at the time in Washington. We didn't even tell
                    Benjamin Lu that this meeting was taking place at a hotel in New York. So they
                    met up in New York. I didn't go. My country director, Bodey, went. Tarnoff
                    represented State. He and Berger delivered both the reassurances to Taiwan and
                    the point that they not be provocative at the same time.</p>
                <pb facs="0683" n="Page0683"/>
                <p>I happen to think that this combination of rhetoric and diplomacy with Beijing
                    and Taipei was one of our finer moments. This deployment of carriers to the
                    Taiwan Straits helped to cool things down. From then on our relationship with
                    Beijing started to improve. As I've already indicated, Beijing probably saw that
                    the missile firings had backfired. They had caused apprehensions in Asia and
                    caused a conflict with us in which Beijing had to stand down and stop firing
                    missiles. So their firing of these missiles hadn't been a ringing success. On
                    the other hand, President Jiang Zemin, of the PRC, had now protected his flank
                    on Taiwan, after looking awkward because of the visit to the U.S. by President
                    Li Teng-hui of Taiwan. Jiang Zemin was still consolidating his position. The PRC
                    showed that it could cause jitters of an economic, if not security, nature, with
                    regard to Taiwan. But on the whole, we figured that the missile firings toward
                    Taiwan was not one of the PRC's wisest decisions.Meanwhile, we got lots of
                    credit in Asia. Taiwan, of course, warmly welcomed our show of support. The
                    Asian reactions were very supportive but as usual quiet. I think that the
                    Australians came up with a public statement. Many Asian governments patted us on
                    the back and were very happy, although not many said so publicly. This was the
                    usual game that they played with Beijing. We know that we did ourselves an awful
                    lot of good throughout Asia, without exception, because the East Asian countries
                    were concerned about this episode, about China creating mischief in 1994 in the
                    South China Sea, and China's buildup of its military. Even though nobody wanted
                    a confrontation with China, and rather wanted engagement, the East Asian
                    countries were concerned about Chinese power. That was one of the reasons, along
                    with keeping Japan under control, that these countries welcomed the U.S.
                    military presence in East Asia. So they welcomed our checking China. These
                    actions were also applauded in Congress and in the U.S. press. We got a lot of
                    credit, in contrast to our previously having taken a beating on China policy on
                    some occasions. It was kind of refreshing to have all of these kudos. I think
                    that we deserved them and that we handled this situation quite well. To this
                    day, even critics of the China policy during Clinton's presidency all applaud
                    our handling of the 1996 missile crisis.</p>
                <p>We then worked on all of these other elements of the Chinese-American
                    relationship. There were major negotiations on nuclear non-proliferation. We got
                    the Chinese to agree by May, 1996, not to ship any nuclear materials to
                    non-safeguarded facilities in Pakistan. With this and other Chinese steps, we
                    were able to lift the sanctions previously imposed, and so we made progress on
                    nuclear non-proliferation.</p>
                <p>On intellectual property rights we threatened China with the largest sanctions in
                    the history of trade negotiations in order to get their compliance. These
                    sanctions would have affected about $3.0 billion worth of Chinese exports. We
                    got close to publishing the list, but our leverage worked. As a result of tough
                    negotiations, we got a very good agreement, including arrangements for
                    enforcement by the Chinese, which our industry strongly supported. So we got
                    that issue out of the way.</p>
                <pb facs="0684" n="Page0684"/>
                <p>We were stepping up our dialogue on other issues. We had continual meetings at my
                    level in Washington and, of course, in regional security talks in July, 1996.
                    Also, Tony Lake went to Beijing in July, 1996. I went with him once again. We
                    continued the strategic dialogue with the PRC, in this case in Beijing. It was
                    held in the Dai Yutai guest house, which is in a compound away from the office
                    buildings of the PRC Government. It wasn't as distant from the center of the PRC
                    Government as Pamela Harriman's estate in Middleburg, Virginia, had been for the
                    talks with Liu. We had similar meetings with PRC officials on the strategic
                    dialogue regarding where we wanted to go strategically in the future in handling
                    ongoing, tough issues, as well as expanding our positive agenda.</p>
                <p>We were now talking about reciprocal summit meetings. We got pretty concrete
                    during that visit. We had come up with this idea earlier as well, but not in as
                    concrete terms. In addition to Tony Lake carrying on this dialogue, I
                    participated in it, and we found it very helpful. Secretary Christopher was also
                    working very hard through messages to the Chinese foreign minister and through
                    his meetings to get the Chinese-American relationship back on track. Christopher
                    made several statements and speeches, although we never got one from President
                    Clinton. We had begun to solve some of the contentious issues. The extension of
                    MFN was resolved without difficulty. We made modest progress on trade, nuclear
                    non-proliferation, and even human rights. None of this was dramatic. The Taiwan
                    issue was defused, and we began to expand our agenda.</p>
                <p>In short, by the time Secretary Christopher went to China in November, 1996, we
                    had developed considerable momentum. Already in the air was the possibility of a
                    summit meeting. We went to China just before going to Manila, where the annual
                    summit meeting of APEC was taking place, and President Clinton would meet PRC
                    President Jiang Zemin. This was a happy note to close off Clinton's first,
                    four-year term, in contrast to Christopher's earlier Beijing visit. There were
                    very warm and friendly discussions with PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. It was
                    agreed that the two Presidents would announce mutual summit meetings when they
                    got to Manila a few days later. We made some progress on other substantive
                    issues.</p>
                <p>Christopher gave a major speech on bilateral relations in Shanghai. With my
                    encouragement, he deleted references to “partnership” with China as being overly
                    optimistic. We had a banner with this phrase at the speech site changed.
                    Christopher and I didn't want a misleading label that would make us look naive
                    in our relations with China. But in the second term, after we had both left, the
                    Clinton Administration unwisely used the even worse phrase “strategic
                    partnership.”</p>
                <p>We went from China to Manila where the two presidents jointlannounced the two
                    summit meetings.</p>
                <pb facs="0685" n="Page0685"/>
                <p>So we concluded the first Clinton term in a lot better shape than we had been at
                    any time during those four years [1993-1997]. Specifically, we had come a great
                    distance from March, 1996. Now I'll answer your questions.</p>
                <p>I would agree that we could have done some things better before 1996. On the
                    other hand, I think that any fair-minded critic would say that from March, 1996,
                    the nadir of the Chinese-American relationship, we did an excellent job. This
                    continued till the end of the first Clinton term where U.S.-China relations were
                    in their best shape of the four years. I think that we handled ourselves very
                    well with an appropriate mixture of firmness, expanding the dialogue, and
                    highlighting a positive agenda. We finally were getting more public statements
                    about our policy toward the PRC, but still not out of the White House.</p>
                <p>So this was one of the reasons that I felt comfortable about leaving at the end
                    of the first Clinton term. I thought that our policy toward Asia was generally
                    in good shape. We had strengthened our alliance with Japan, reduced tensions in
                    Korea, normalized relations with Vietnam and moved ahead with APEC and ARF, and
                    made progress elsewhere. I felt that our China relationship was on track and
                    heading for summit meetings. We had gotten out of this difficult period and were
                    headed on a generally positive but still inevitably mixed course. Given my long
                    relationship with the China issue, I wanted to feel that way before I left
                    government service.</p>
                <p>Q: We're probably reaching our endurance levels here, but, just for a minute,
                    let's talk about when we were in the trough of our relations with China. At that
                    time, did anyone say that we ought to play or threaten to play, the Taiwan card?
                    I mean that if the PRC was going to be beastly on human rights or something like
                    that, we might do something like invite President Li Teng-hui to come to the
                    U.S. for an informal lunch at the White House, or something like that.</p>
                <p>LORD: That's a good question and a fair one. The answer is: “No.” I don't recall
                    anyone ever suggesting that. I myself would have been against such a course. I
                    could get impatient with the PRC and would argue about how firm we should be
                    with them. I believe in using leverage and pressure at times. However, you have
                    to take into account the best mix with the Chinese and face and the effects, as
                    opposed to posturing.</p>
                <p>On Taiwan I always felt that we shouldn't touch that. It was too sensitive. I
                    didn't think that we should be any less faithful to Taiwan but I also didn't
                    think that we should be provocative to Beijing. I don't recall anyone ever
                    suggesting that we should stick it to the Chinese by fooling around with our
                    Taiwan policy. So this just didn't happen.</p>
                <pb facs="0686" n="Page0686"/>
                <p>In the inevitable debates over individual arms sales to Taiwan some people in the
                    Pentagon and in the Department of Commerce may sometimes have wanted to be
                    somewhat more ambitious, although I'm not even sure about that. The Pentagon
                    would not necessarily always be for arms sales to Taiwan. These were individual
                    decisions, and reasonable people could disagree on Taiwan defense needs, whether
                    offensive or defensive. I was always supportive of a solid arms sales policy to
                    support Taiwan.</p>
                <p>As for diplomacy, no, no one ever said that the PRC leaders were being tough and
                    therefore let's give President Lee Teng-hui a state dinner at the White House,
                    and so on. This kind of possible action was never proposed at my level, or any
                    other level.</p>
                <p>Q: Regarding the missile crisis caused by the PRC firing missiles near Taiwan,
                    there had been an even more dangerous crisis during the Cold War. We deployed
                    Patriot missile batteries in Israel. The Patriot missiles were designed to shoot
                    down just the type of missiles that the PRC had. Did we consider doing anything
                    of that nature?</p>
                <p>LORD: We had already provided Patriot missile equipment to Taiwan. It was called
                    MAD. This did not mean “Mutual Assured Destruction” but something else called,
                    “Modified Air Defense.” I don't remember that we rushed this equipment to them
                    during the middle of the Taiwan Straits crisis. Maybe we provided it to them
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: We had promised to provide Patriot missiles to the
                    Chinese Nationalists at some time before the Dole-Clinton election campaign of
                    1996. I know that Senator Dole spoke about providing Theater Missile Defense to
                    Taiwan, while Clinton said that we were going to speed up the delivery of
                    Patriot missiles to Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Charles Stuart Kennedy] This was during the 1996
                        electiocampaign.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Q: [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker] This was after the Taiwan Straits missile firings
                    began, so I'm not sure what was actually in place in Taiwan. I have a few other
                    questions. What was your assessment of Lee?</p>
                <p>LORD: I'm basically positive about him. I am less positive than I used to be. He
                    jerked us around on the question of his 1995 trip and speech and the way he was
                    playing with Congress directly instead of the Administration. So that behavior
                    has modestly altered my view of him. However, in terms of the big picture, I
                    think that he deserves great credit. He will be recognized as the man who
                    consolidated and really brought democracy to the presidential level in Taiwan,
                    while maintaining its great economic performance. So, on those grounds alone, I
                    think that he deserves a great deal of credit. His state to state formulation of
                    relations with China in the late 1990s was unduly provocative, however.</p>
                <pb facs="0687" n="Page0687"/>
                <p>Let me make this clear. I can understand his frustrations, and Taiwan's
                    frustrations, about not getting any more international space. We have encouraged
                    the PRC, and we should continue to do so, to let Taiwan participate in some of
                    these international organizations, making clear that this doesn't represent
                    recognition of Taiwan's statehood. It's not a threat to Beijing or to the one
                    China policy. The PRC has let Taiwan participate in APEC and in the WTO. Why not
                    some of the other organizations? Taiwan should be a member of the organizations
                    that don't require statehood and an observer in those that do.</p>
                <p>I understand Taiwan's frustrations. It has turned in a great economic
                    performance, is one of the world's largest markets, despite its relatively small
                    size, and has gold and foreign exchange reserves which are among the largest in
                    the world. It is a flourishing democracy, has generally acted in a responsible
                    way, and has a population of 23 million people. I understand its concern that it
                    doesn't have more international profile, even if it preserves the one China
                    principle. However, having said that and against that backdrop, Taiwan, in fact,
                    Lee bypassed the American administration and dealt directly with Congress. It
                    would be a correct description to say that Taiwan did this, in addition to Lee's
                    double crossing us in connection with his speech at Cornell University.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Our policy toward Taiwan has basically been one of
                    strategic ambiguity in terms of what we would do in this situation. First of
                    all, how much discussion has there been of changing that policy? Secondly, do
                    you think that President Lee Teng-hui made an assumption that Taiwan would have
                    American support, regardless of what happened?</p>
                <p>LORD: A good question. Of course, we didn't want Taiwan to think that they had a
                    blank check from uThat was why we were telling Taiwan not to be provocative just
                    because we were deploying the two carriers to the Taiwan Straits. After all, it
                    was Beijing which provoked that crisis. Nevertheless, it was not in Taiwan's or
                    our interest to have a conflict or tensions in the Taiwan Straits. Just because
                    the U.S. had a commitment to the security of Taiwan, it should not think it
                    could abuse that commitment by getting us all into a scrape which we all would
                    be well advised to avoid.</p>
                <p>During the 1996 missile crisis, there was some discussion of the question of
                    strategic ambiguity within the Administration, but I don't recall that there was
                    any view that we should be more precise. During this time I testified a lot
                    before Congressional committees and gave a lot of interviews to the press. I got
                    a lot of questions about why we were not more precise in our response to the PRC
                    challenges, i.e., why we maintained strategic ambiguity. In answer to these
                    questions I used one or another of the following themes.</p>
                <pb facs="0688" n="Page0688"/>
                <p>First of all, the Taiwan Relations Act itself states that any administration has
                    to consult the Congress before taking any specific actions. So I said to
                    Congressmen opposing ambiguity that it was rather ironic that they seemed to
                    want the administration to get out in front of them, whereas the Taiwan
                    Relations Act states that there should be consultations with Congress before
                    action is taken. Secondly, there is a provision in the Taiwan Relations Act, and
                    I don't have the verbatim language of the act here before me, that the
                    administration is obliged to come to the Congress when the situation has
                    developed to the point that the threat to security is so serious that we should
                    consult with Congress on what to do. We've never reached that point. Even in the
                    crisis which arose over the PRC missile firings in the general direction of
                    Taiwan, we didn't invoke that part of the Act. Thirdly, it is prudent generally
                    that you don't state in advance what you will do in specific situations.
                    Fourthly, and most fundamentally, if we get away from ambiguity and go in either
                    direction, we're in trouble. If the PRC thinks that we won't come to the defense
                    of Taiwan in a crunch, it's going to be aggressive and will press Taiwan. In
                    that case we're likely to run into a difficult situation and possibly a
                    conflict. On the other hand, if Taiwan thinks that we're going to come to its
                    defense, no matter what happens, it's going to be provocative, knowing that it's
                    going to have a free ride no matter how angry Beijing gets.</p>
                <p>Therefore, we can't be precise about what our response would be in a crisis.
                    Having said that, we've got to use the right kind of adjectives and send
                    aircraft carriers at the right moments to make clear that it's dangerous for
                    Beijing to think that it can act aggressively. However, as we did it, we
                    reassured Beijing that we're not changing our policy. Meanwhile, we made it
                    clear to Taiwan that it doesn't have a blank check.</p>
                <p>So there wasn't much debate within the administration on this crisis. Most people
                    saw that rationale. I don't recall people arguing that we should be more
                    precise. Frankly, I didn't feel too much pressure from Capitol Hill. I think
                    that the merits of the case were pretty persuasive. A few Congressmen argued
                    that we should be very precise and tell Beijing exactly what we were going to
                    do.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Yes. Subsequently, I think that both Secretary of
                    Defense Perry, and particularly Joe Nye, have said publicly that we ought to be
                    more precise. Would you say that this is a point which may have evolved in their
                    thinking since the missile crisis in the Taiwan Straits and which they didn't
                    express at the time?</p>
                <p>LORD: That's correct. I'm not even sure that Joe Nye was in the administration at
                    the time of the crisis over PRC missile firings at targets near Taiwan. I think
                    that he may have left the administration by then.</p>
                <pb facs="0689" n="Page0689"/>
                <p>Now, to complete the coverage of China during the Clinton Administration, I went
                    on a trip with Secretary of Defense Perry and Senators Nunn and Warner
                    [Democrat, Georgia, and Republican, Virginia, respectively], which modestly
                    advanced the military relationship with the PRC. I don't remember the date. I
                    also went on a trip with John Deutch [then Director of CIA], which was black hat
                    but not totally secret. We were prepared to confirm the trip, which, indeed, was
                    part of a longer Asian trip. It leaked out, when he was in South Korea, that he
                    had already been to China. I was with him on that trip. This was very unusual -
                    for the CIA Director to take an Assistant Secretary of State with him. But
                    Deutch had a high opinion of me and wanted my counsel on China. We got along
                    very well. He was not particularly pleased with the Chinese response to
                    intelligence sharing and other issues. He generally wasn't too enthusiastic
                    about the Chinese. I wanted to cover those two trips which I went on, in
                    addition to meetings I had with the President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Could you say anything about why
                        JiSasser was chosen to be Ambassador to the PRC? How did that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: First, Ambassador Stape Roy had been terrific, but he was due to leave
                    China and go to Indonesia. We needed a top grade replacement for him in Beijing.
                    Of course, ideally we would want somebody who had had a lot of experience on
                    China and would have the kind of background that Stape Roy and I had. On the
                    other hand, we also needed someone of stature. We were at the point where we
                    were trying to improve our relations with the PRC. We had former Vice President
                    Mondale in Japan, so we wanted somebody who had some stature in Beijing.</p>
                <p>We have some terrific people, career people on China in the Foreign Service. But
                    in terms of timing, we've gotten beyond Stape Roy, Art Hummel, Winston Lord, and
                    that generation, and the other ones coming up haven't quite made it to the point
                    where they could yet be Ambassadors to the PRC. Even if these other, capable
                    people could handle the post of Ambassador to the PRC, they don't yet quite have
                    the reputation to do so in terms of their resume. So in the career service we
                    weren't quite at the point where we had a natural choice, though Charles Freeman
                    thought that he was a natural choice to be Ambassador to China. Chas was very
                    disappointed. He had hoped that he would get this assignment. There were some
                    people in the administration who thought that he was overly sympathetic to
                    Beijing. You could have made the case for appointing Freeman as Ambassador to
                    the PRC, since he had been Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, he had the best resume,
                    the most expertise, and was the best Chinese language speaker in the Foreign
                    Service. But there were doubts whether he would be objective enough, whether he
                    would suffer from clientitis.</p>
                <pb facs="0690" n="Page0690"/>
                <p>Briefly, there was no other career candidate. You would have to talk about how
                    well he got along with people in the Pentagon. I don't know anything about that.
                    I would think that they would have checked him with the White House. As I say,
                    some people felt that he wouldn't be tough enough on the Chinese. I never got
                    the impression that Freeman was almost going to be chosen. I believe that in the
                    White House there was a feeling that there was a need for a political
                    Ambassador, one with status and political ties.</p>
                <p>Jim Sasser had been senior Democratic Senator from Tennessee. I think that he
                    probably would have been Democratic leader in the Senate if he had been
                    reelected to the Senate in 1996 and if the Democrats hadn't lost their majority
                    in the Senate. In any case, he was one of the leaders of the Democratic Party.
                    He was very close to Vice President Al Gore. He was defeated for reelection to
                    the Senate in 1996 and was looking for a job. So I believe that the initiative
                    for Jim Sasser's appointment as Ambassador to China came from Vice President
                    Gore. President Clinton also thought highly of him. So that's how it came to
                    be.Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: I've forgotten exactly when the U.S.-Japan
                    guidelines were finalized, but clearly they were being discussed while you were
                    still in the State Department.</p>
                <p>LORD: Oh, absolutely. We'll get into that in some other session, but I worked
                    very closely with Joe Nye to insulate the U.S.-Japan security relationship and
                    our overall ties from the trade disputes that we had with Japan. Bill Perry
                    [then Secretary of Defense] took the lead on defense guidelines, and Secretary
                    Christopher, my deputy, Tom Hubbard, and I worked with him and his people,
                    especially Kurt Campbell. These guidelines came out around the time of the
                    President's trip to Japan, which was in the spring of 1996.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: It was a very successful trip. It had been postponed from November, 1995,
                    because President Clinton said that he had to stay home because the budget had
                    not yet been passed. He couldn't go to the APEC meeting in Japan. He was
                    scheduled to make a state visit to Japan, as well as attend the APEC
                    meeting.</p>
                <p>We were determined to strengthen our relations with Japan, which is, of course,
                    an important partner in Asia. We had had these trade disputes with Japan. I want
                    to get into this in more detail in another session. We also felt that with the
                    end of the Cold War and the passage of 15 or 20 years it was time to update the
                    guidelines on U.S. policy toward Japan. China had started complaining and had
                    become suspicious. This feeling seemed to have been directed at Taiwan. It
                    appears that the initial, Presidential visit and the Defense guidelines
                    document, also reaffirming the Japan-U.S. alliance generally, which would have
                    taken place in November, 1995, would have been strong, in any event. Then the
                    Taiwan missile crisis, which relates to your question, I'm sure, intervened
                    between the original date for the Presidential visit to Japan and when the visit
                    actually took place, in April, 1996.</p>
                <pb facs="0691" n="Page0691"/>
                <p>Some people have said that the Japan guidelines document was strengthened because
                    of the Taiwan missile crisis. The answer to this is, “Yes.” Japan again began to
                    become worried about an aggressive China. However, I want to make the point that
                    this Japan guidelines was going to be a very strong statement of principles. I
                    can't remember the exact time when we finalized the revision of the Japan
                    Defense guidelines document, because this was an ongoing process. It was clear
                    that the revision of the Japan Defense guidelines document was given greater
                    impetus by the Taiwan missile crisis. It was kept ambiguous whether the
                    guidelines document applied to Taiwan. Neither we nor the Japanese have either
                    confirmed or denied it. We were not about to deny that it applied, because it
                    might well apply. However, it was provocative to Beijing to say that it does
                    apply because it considers Taiwan part of the territory of China. The phrasing
                    of “situations surrounding Taiwan...”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: Situations and areas
                        surrounding...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: “Surrounding Japan,” so it doesn't mention Taiwan. So we and Japan
                    effectively stonewalled the Chinese on what the guidelines document really
                    means. We wanted the Chinese to understand that it might well mean Taiwan.
                    However, we didn't say that it did, because that would be provocative.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: In your experience has it been difficult to get Japan
                    to talk about China? Have there been continuing consultations between the
                    Japanese and American Governments on China problems?</p>
                <p>LORD: There have been no difficulties at all. I went out of my way on this
                    subject myself, because of my own, personal experience in the 1970s, the Nixon
                    Shoku, and so forth. I thought that it was crucial to stay in close touch with
                    Japan. I'll talk about Japan in another session. I went to Japan more than to
                    any other country by far. On almost every Asian trip I would drop in on Japan,
                    either at the beginning or the end. We regularly had regional security
                    dialogues, which I promoted and which we worked on at my level, in getting ready
                    for the ministerial meetings. In May I would usually make a trip around Asia. We
                    would meet with Japan at the beginning and coordinate our strategy. We would
                    maintain a constant dialogue on China policy and make sure that there were no
                    surprises in this regard.</p>
                <p>The only rift between us was on human rights. Japan just wouldn't put any
                    pressure on China. Partly this was natural policy because Japanese commercial
                    instincts always overrode everything. It was also partly because of their guilt
                    feelings about World War II and the “Rape of Nanjing.” The Japanese didn't want
                    to look as if they were lecturing China, when...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Japanese weren't the right people to do that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0692" n="Page0692"/>
                <p>LORD: They weren't the right people. They haven't been exactly forthcoming in
                    confessing their sins in China, or Korea, or World War II generally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what I mean. They haven't really fessed up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. Also, on the other hand, the Japanese have sort of said that, because
                    of their history, it's awkward for them to discuss human rights abuses, even
                    though they don't acknowledge their history.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: The Japanese always seem to be uncomfortable, both
                    when our relations with China are bad and when our relations with China are
                    good.</p>
                <p>LORD: A very good point. If our relations with China are bad, then the Japanese
                    get nervous about tensions in the Taiwan Straits, because they might have to
                    choose between the U.S. and China. If U.S. relations with China are good, the
                    Japanese wonder if it will be at Japan's expense. So the phrases which they have
                    been using, and which you may be familiar with, is that we may either bash Japan
                    or may bypass Japan. Right now the Japanese are concerned about our possibly
                    bypassing Japan.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: One final question that might be a little sensitive,
                    but, particularly, there has been recent pressure by Congress on the
                    administration. Many questions have been asked in Congress about whether the
                    administration should have sanctioned China and/or Pakistan about transfers of
                    missiles and missile technology from China to Pakistan. The administration has
                    always insisted that these transfers haven't been clearly demonstrated. However,
                    intelligence sources have recently suggested that the administration did know
                    about these transfers of missiles and missile technology and that there were
                    such transfers.</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, as you know, there have been a lot of issues during the last several
                    years regarding transfers of technology from China to Pakistan and elsewhere in
                    the nuclear and chemical areas. These reports have reflected varying degrees of
                    precision and severity, sanctionability, and so forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0693" n="Page0693"/>
                <p>We did invoke sanctions against China on two occasions, in 1993 and 1995, in this
                    general area. I think that the specific area to which you refer is whether we
                    had evidence to prove that they shipped missiles and technology to Pakistan. The
                    general feeling was that they were right on the edge, but we never had a smoking
                    gun. In effect, without getting into classified material, we saw suspicious
                    crates and heard chatter about unpacking these crates. We were able to see some
                    signs of training by Pakistanis on how to use certain equipment. This would have
                    been a real hammer if we had invoked the sanctions. I admit that people were not
                    anxious to do this. In any event, you need very high legal standards if you're
                    going to do that, and we didn't have a smoking gun.Furthermore, we were making
                    progress, generally, in the nuclear area with China. But we were now more
                    concerned about missiles. At that time, the Chinese were then, and even more so
                    now, linking their proliferation of missile technology with our providing arms
                    to Taiwan and in specific terms, Theater Missile Defense equipment. So the
                    Chinese are tough on missiles. They say that it is proliferation when we ship
                    something to Taiwan, which we of course totally reject. There are some
                    ambiguities regarding materials useful for chemical weapons. However, in the
                    nuclear area the Chinese were making progress throughout this period. That was
                    another incentive not to find the PRC guilty on missiles. It is fair to say that
                    there were those, certainly in CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] and maybe in
                    DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency] who felt that the evidence was sufficient and
                    that we should invoke sanctions. But others, including in State, argued we had
                    to have a smoking gun.</p>
                <p>We never crossed over that line. I would be the first to admit that we were not
                    anxious to do so. I will also say that if we did have a real smoking gun, of
                    course we would have invoked sanctions. We had every legal and moral obligation
                    to do so. And the Congress would have been very insistent.</p>
                <p>There were different sanctions for different reasons. Whatever their laudable
                    purpose, they were generally not well crafted, leaving aside a debate on whether
                    sanctions are effective at all. Most of the effect of sanctions is to cut off
                    our exports. So it hurts our economic interests and has very little impact on
                    Chinese imports. Now, of course, sometimes they want our technology, for
                    whatever reason. But, on the whole, the sanctions were hurting American
                    companies more than China. So the sanctions did not apply particularly effective
                    pressure.</p>
                <pb facs="0694" n="Page0694"/>
                <p>We made progress in the nuclear area. China signed many international agreements.
                    It cut off nuclear assistance to Iran, beyond what it was required to do. It
                    also tightened up on Pakistan. We worked very hard on the missile and other
                    areas as well, through a combination of selective sanctions when we had to apply
                    them and when we felt that they were required. Incentives, either involving
                    lifting the sanctions or possibly by defining more carefully dual technology
                    exports, and the geopolitical dialogue which we carried on were maintained. We
                    have continued to explain why it is in China's self-interest to clamp down on
                    nuclear and missile proliferation. We have said many times that the nuclear arms
                    race in South Asia is going to be of more concern to China than to the U.S.,
                    because of geography. We have suggested to the Chinese that they may have helped
                    to create a monster in their own backyard. And with China's growing need for
                    Persian Gulf oil, it has an interest in making sure countries like Iran cannot
                    threaten shipping with missiles. Also nuclear weapons in North Korea would be a
                    real headache for them, and could provoke Japan, South Korea, even Taiwan to
                    develop nuclear weapons.</p>
                <p>So the PRC has joined the NPT [Non Proliferation Treaty] and the Comprehensive
                    Test Ban Treaty, even though the Chinese had done much less testing than anybody
                    else. They agreed to cut off the export of fissile materials. They made this
                    agreement on non safeguarded facilities after the ring magnet episode with
                    Pakistan. They agreed not to ship any more missiles to Pakistan. China also
                    joined the Zanger Committee on nuclear exports, and has helped us with regard to
                    North Korea. I think that it's fair to say that, on the whole, they've moved
                    forward on the nuclear front. Of course, that was shown by the decision of
                    President Clinton to go forward with a nuclear agreement during the visit of
                    President Jiang Zemin last October, implementing the agreement which we reached
                    in 1985 when I was Ambassador to the PRC. We had never sent this agreement to
                    Congress for ratification because we couldn't say, in good conscience, that the
                    PRC had ended its unhelpful activities with Pakistan and Iran. The fact that the
                    President could now go ahead with the nuclear agreement showed the progress made
                    with China in the nuclear area.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we made progress with nuclear arms after heavy slogging over a period of
                    months and years. We encouraged the PRC successfully, when I was Ambassador in
                    Beijing and since then, to cut off all nuclear cooperation with Iran, even
                    though it's legal. Iran is a member of the NPT and is subject to supervision
                    under that treaty. We just said that such nuclear cooperation was unwise, even
                    though it wasn't illegal. Such cooperation, if it had been with Pakistan, would
                    have been illegal. China has also agreed to cut off sending any conventional
                    missiles to Iran, so we have made further progress in this area.</p>
                <pb facs="0695" n="Page0695"/>
                <p>Let me make just a couple of other points. Whatever tactical mistakes we made
                    with China, and I think that we inevitably made some in this complex
                    relationship over the four years I have been talking about, I have tried to
                    explain also where I think that we have done well. I think that the mistakes we
                    made were not so egregious, although I would say that we did much better toward
                    the end of the 1993-1997 period than at the beginning. I would like to make the
                    key point that it takes two to tango, to use that awful cliche. There is a
                    tendency by some of my former government colleagues and academic experts, which
                    I still resent, that when things go wrong in our relations with China, it's
                    always the fault of the U.S. In fact, it may often be China's fault.</p>
                <p>I still feel strongly about some of the experts and former officials who jumped
                    on us because of some of these matters, when they really ought to have been
                    tougher on China. That is also true of the business community as a whole. This
                    is not to say that we did everything correctly. My experience with China now
                    goes back to the 1971 secret trip with Kissinger and a year or two before then,
                    preparing for it. During recent years, the mood and the attitude of the Chinese
                    leadership has been the most arrogant and prickly that I've ever encountered.
                    This doesn't mean that I'm not in favor of engagement with China or that we
                    shouldn't work at this relationship. As I've said, “They never promised us a
                    rose garden.” However, for a variety of reasons the Chinese have been
                    particularly difficult to deal with. This includes their growing power,
                    invocation of nationalism, apprehension about American encirclement.</p>
                <p>Before I go any further in that direction, let me say that in our own backyard we
                    suffered greatly because President Clinton never gave a speech on China during
                    1993-1997 and that our moves were not always the wisest. However, we faced the
                    lingering effects of the Tienanmen Square massacre, the end of the Soviet
                    threat, and Chinese aggressive actions. It wasn't just that the Chinese are bad
                    at public relations. They do things in the field of human rights, Tibet, weapons
                    transactions, market access, and Taiwan that are bad period. They deserve a bad
                    press at times. So you put that together with Tienanmen Square images and the
                    end of the Soviet threat, and you have problems in the U.S. with respect to
                    China.</p>
                <p>Moreover, there is the Chinese mood. First there is the point that, over 5,000
                    years of its history, China was number one and the “Middle Kingdom.” Everyone
                    else was a barbarian, irrelevant, or was a tributary state of China. The Chinese
                    were leading the world and were superior. Then the Chinese had a bad century or,
                    say, 150 years when they were humiliated by foreigners. The country was carved
                    up by European powers. There was the Opium War and the Japanese invasion of
                    China. Whatever the case, China from the mid-1800s to when Mao Zedong took over
                    the country in the late 1940s, looked as if it was being trampled on by
                    outsiders.</p>
                <pb facs="0696" n="Page0696"/>
                <p>So China is a country which, in effect, has very little experience - only the
                    last couple of decades - in dealing with outside countries as equals. During
                    most of its history China was number one. More recently, it has been humiliated.
                    So there is a combination of arrogance, xenophobia, and nationalism. This is not
                    new. It goes back for some time, but it is part of the general background to the
                    present.</p>
                <p>Then, on top of that, there is the always tricky phenomenon of an emerging power
                    like China, which is in the process of becoming a great power, adjusting its
                    status to the world's superpower. That was the case with the Germans early in
                    the 20th century. That is a difficult process to handle. This often happens.
                    Then, on top of that, there is the fact that China is growing very strongly in
                    the economic field and, to a certain extent, in military terms, though this has
                    been exaggerated in some quarters. This gives the Chinese a certain
                    self-confidence, a certain arrogance and a certain desire to flex their muscles
                    and also to be treated as equals, as they should, anyway, as a great, rich,
                    historic and cultural force. On top of that the Chinese have a certain smugness
                    vis-a-vis the Soviet experience. They figure that Gorbachev and other Russian
                    leaders allowed too much political freedom without making economic progress. So
                    the Soviets lost their empire, and the Communist Party lost control of the
                    country. The Chinese feel that they're not going to make the same mistake. And
                    they say, see, it's working. The Chinese leaders say that they have lifted the
                    lives and living standards of the Chinese people, and that they have managed to
                    do that without allowing political freedom. They think that they're not going to
                    make the same mistake which Moscow made.</p>
                <p>Then the Chinese military are demanding more of a role. In the South China Sea
                    and the Taiwan missile crisis, they clearly had a significant role to play. They
                    showed that they can be more aggressive. In addition, there is the fact that
                    there isn't a single, dominant leader in China; whether he was good or bad is
                    another issue. The Chinese had previously had Mao, Zhou En-lai, and Deng
                    Xiaoping. Although Jiang Zemin is now clearly the first among equals and is
                    consolidating his position, throughout most of this period he was still engaged
                    in trying to solidify his status. It was only in 1997 that he completed
                    strengthening his position. He had had a successful Congress of the Communist
                    Party of China, Deng had passed away, there was a relatively successful
                    reversion of Hong Kong to China, although the jury is still out on this, and
                    Jiang Zemin had a successful trip to the U.S. However, during most of this time
                    Jiang Zemin was watching his flanks. The Taiwan missile crisis is a good example
                    of that. So this meant he couldn't afford to look soft on sensitive issues.
                    Thus, China did not have a self-confident, charismatic leader who could steer
                    the China-U.S. relationship as Deng, Mao, and Zhou had done earlier on.</p>
                <pb facs="0697" n="Page0697"/>
                <p>Then there are Chinese suspicions of the United States. Some of these are
                    probably for tactical reasons to put us on the defensive. But some of the
                    Chinese leaders genuinely feel this. The most extreme Chinese view of the United
                    States is that we're keeping them down, and we don't want another super power
                    around. So, in this view, we are trying to restrain, contain, and isolate them.
                    This is allegedly proved by our maintaining our military presence in the Pacific
                    Ocean area and by our strengthening our relations with Japan and so on.
                    Allegedly, the U.S. is trying to control China's exports of military materials
                    and military sales and is allegedly interfering in the Taiwan Straits and in
                    Taiwan generally. Another allegation is that we are trying to keep China out of
                    the WTO [World Trade Organization], and generally trying to keep China down.
                    Then we are trying to divide up China's territory, with pressures on Hong Kong,
                    Tibet, and Taiwan. On top of that we are allegedly trying to subvert China
                    politically by pushing human rights and democracy, so that the PRC Government
                    will lose political control of the country.</p>
                <p>If you put all of these allegations together, I would argue that that's a fairly
                    difficult mood to deal with. This is not by any means an excuse for any mistakes
                    we might have made. It just means that, objectively, it's not going to be easy
                    to deal with these people.</p>
                <p>We should continue the policy of engagement, which I am in favor of. However,
                    when we run into trouble, because the Chinese fire missiles, lock up dissidents,
                    crush Tibet, or sell dangerous weapons in volatile areas of the world, some of
                    the so-called China experts in thU.S. or some of the former U.S. Government
                    officials should admit that maybe the Chinese are making trouble, and it's not
                    just the U.S. administration.</p>
                <p>One other China-related issue - the visit of Mrs. Clinton to China in September
                    1995 for a UN-sponsored International Conference on Women. I may have covered
                    this elsewhere. I was with her as foreign policy advisor. She also went on to
                    Mongolia with my urging to show support for that struggling democracy, and an
                    inherent contrast to repressive Beijing. There she met with high level
                    Mongolians, of course, and visited a nomadic family in a yurt. Very colorful
                    trip, and the Mongolians were immensely pleased.</p>
                <pb facs="0698" n="Page0698"/>
                <p>I had met Mrs. Clinton before, including sitting next to her at a White House
                    dinner. I was very impressed with her intelligence which is well known. We
                    worked hard with her and her staff to get ready for the trip. On the plane to
                    China, and throughout the trip I was also impressed with other qualities, not so
                    well known by the public - her sense of humor, her willingness to listen to
                    ideas, her approachfulness, without losing the dignity of First Lady. We had a
                    good time, figuratively putting our feet up, with her and her staff. She was
                    pleasantly surprised that I encouraged her to be tough at the conference on
                    women's issues, rather than being a State Department softy worried about
                    upsetting the Chinese who were a clear target on some of these issues. I knew
                    she cared deeply about these issues and that U.S. leadership was important and
                    that her audience would be watching her. So she gave a very firm and well
                    received speech. There was a driving rainstorm and trouble getting around the
                    swampy compound outside Beijing that the Chinese forced the NGO groups to occupy
                    so as to isolate them. I also knew that being firm on these global issues
                    wouldn't really hurt us with the Chinese.</p>
                <p>We didn't even finally decide to go to China for the conference until the Chinese
                    released Harry Wu, a dissident who they caught sneaking back into China.</p>
                <p>Q: Right. The next session will concentrate on your time as American Ambassador
                    to China. Then we'll revert back to your time with the NSC and talk about things
                    other than China. Particularly Vietnam and the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>LORD: That's right. We'll do China first, and then you're welcome to hear about
                    anything else. I assume that that's up to you. I assume that that's what you
                    want.</p>
                <p>Q [Nancy Bernkopf Tucker]: That's the main thing.</p>
                <p>LORD: We'll certainly finish the discussion of China, I think. I would welcome
                    both of you going over the transcript and thinking of any additional questions
                    that you might have. I'll try to make sure that I haven't left anything out.
                    Maybe in half a day we can get through the rest of it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: Unless you have any general questions about the course oevents.</p>
                <pb facs="0699" n="Page0699"/>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] Some may come up, but let's start with the number one country on
                    your list of goals, Japan. First, I'd like you to talk about dealing with Japan.
                    I remember reading, in Kissinger's White House Memoirs, about the problems
                    involved in dealing with the Italian Government. The Italian Government kept
                    changing, and it was difficult to deal with the Italians. I was wondering who
                    called the shots and where Japanese Government policy is decided, from your
                    perspective.</p>
                <p>LORD: First of all, throughout my service as Assistant Secretary for East Asian
                    and Pacific Affairs, I considered Japan the single most important partner of the
                    U.S. It had the highest priority for attention.</p>
                <p>There is no question that our relationship with Japan was complicated somewhat by
                    the Japanese internal politics. During the course of the four years of the first
                    Clinton term there were five Japanese Prime Ministers and five Foreign Ministers
                    for Secretary Christopher to deal with. Of course, in Japan there is the general
                    problem caused by the fact that they work slowly and deal by consensus. So it
                    takes a while to get decisions out of them. On the plus side is the fact that,
                    once they reach a decision and there is full consensus on it, they can implement
                    it fairly quickly. However, even that is being challenged as we speak. The
                    general cautiousness of Japanese politicians always makes it difficult to deal
                    with them, and this is especially true on sensitive issues, such as economic
                    questions, where a government decision can affect their domestic constituents.
                    As a result, members of the Japanese Government are always looking over their
                    political shoulder. That was a general, complicating factor.In the Bureau of
                    East Asian Affairs we felt, and I think that it is fair to say that the Clinton
                    administration felt, that Japan is still our number one partner. It is not a
                    zero sum game to try to improve relations with both China and Japan. We
                    shouldn't have to lose ground with one country because of the situation in the
                    other country. However, first of all, Japan is our major ally in Asia. We have
                    troops stationed in Japan, and this country is a cushion for our whole security
                    position. Japan's economy accounts for two-thirds of the region in GNP. Japan is
                    a giant in terms of our economic connections. It is a democracy and is a
                    democratic ally.</p>
                <pb facs="0700" n="Page0700"/>
                <p>Beyond that, in addition to the bilateral ties between Japan and the United
                    States, there is an increasing number of areas where we believed that we could
                    and should work together. These ranged from regional security questions, like
                    those in Korea and Cambodia, both of which are very important, and the regional
                    security dialogues, to economic questions, where Japan plays an important role
                    in APEC, as well as Japan's economic strength. Another area of close contact
                    between the U.S. and Japan is the United Nations, where we have supported them
                    for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. This reflects Japan's strength
                    and responsibilities. Also included are the so-called newer issues, which I
                    referred to in my confirmation statement before the Senate Foreign Relations
                    Committee. These are the environment, science and technology, and all the other
                    items on this common agenda which we developed with Japan during the four years
                    of jointly addressing global problems. Increasingly, Japan, and here Prime
                    Minister Hashimoto gets some credit, is willing to engage in United Nations
                    peacekeeping activities. Japan has been willing to set aside the taboos on the
                    use of military force which goes back to World War II. This included active
                    involvement in Cambodia, where Japan stationed some peacekeeping forces, in
                    Africa, and elsewhere. Japan was getting involved in world affairs in that way,
                    and we encouraged that.</p>
                <p>The strategy which we set out was to address the one, serious part of our
                    relationship which was not in good shape, and that is the economic relationship,
                    while simultaneously we sought to insulate that problem from the security
                    relationship. We worked increasingly with the U.S. Defense Department in this
                    regard. As I said, Joe Nye [Assistant Secretary of Defense for International
                    Security Affairs] deserves considerable credit for this, as does former
                    Secretary of Defense Perry and Kurt Campbell, Nye's deputy. We conducted a
                    serious dialogue on security, to review our bilateral relationship, update it,
                    and make sure that we coordinated with Japan on all security matters in the East
                    Asian region. We continually expanded our agenda with Japan, so that we would
                    work increasingly closely on global problems.</p>
                <p>I spent more time on Japan than any other. I went to Japan more than to any other
                    country. Our basic approach early on was the following. If we allowed the trade
                    deficit with Japan to continue indefinitely, and it was not just the trading
                    surplus with us but with the entire world economy, and Japan continued to resist
                    deregulation and opening up its market, over time the political cost in Congress
                    and in labor unions in the U.S. would be such that it could begin to poison the
                    overall relationship with Japan. And perhaps this would erode support for our
                    security relationship. This is important for our security alliance and our troop
                    presence in Japan. After all, this relationship is in our own interest and is
                    not just a favor to Japan.</p>
                <pb facs="0701" n="Page0701"/>
                <p>Also, we were genuinely concerned about American jobs and exports. So just on
                    economic grounds we wanted to improve the situation. We didn't feel, of course,
                    that we had to have a strict, bilateral balance with every country in the world.
                    That's not how the world trading situation works. We felt that when the trade
                    deficit with Japan reached $40 or $50 billion a year, that is a point where it
                    became a political problem, as well as a matter of economic unfairness. A large
                    part of this trade deficit was due to the fact that Japan was unwilling to open
                    up its domestic market to U.S. exports. Japan had taken action to protect its
                    inefficient farmers and in other areas. Also, we were concerned about investment
                    as well.</p>
                <p>As we set out in the Clinton administration, we had a fairly conscious plan about
                    where we wanted to be in terms of Japan after the four years of the first
                    Clinton term. We knew that we would run into some problems with Japan and in
                    public perceptions, including even our domestic audience, if we stepped up the
                    pressure on the economic front. We felt that that was necessary on the economic
                    measures, as I've mentioned, to preserve the other parts of the U.S.-Japan
                    alliance.</p>
                <p>Throughout this period the Department of State was not a soft partner on this.
                    Obviously, the most aggressive and most visible agency was the USTR [U.S. Trade
                    Representative], led by Mickey Kantor and later, Charlene Barshevsky. This was
                    also and emphatically the approach with almost everyone in the U.S. Government.
                    There were serious disputes among the various agencies, with the Embassy in
                    Tokyo weighing in as well, about, for example, going for specific, numerical
                    targets in terms of increasing our exports, how much we would hit the Japanese
                    in public, and the tone and tactics to be used. However, it was never a matter
                    of the Department of State saying that we were being too tough on economic
                    matters with Japan, to the detriment of other aspects of ourrelationship. The
                    U.S. Defense Department said essentially the same thing, i.e., we needed to
                    address the economic issues while - and in order to - preserving the security
                    ties. Thus disagreements within the Administration were on tactics, not the
                    basic strategy.</p>
                <p>The economic agencies and leaders oriented toward domestic problems were also
                    saying: “We have to do this or that for domestic, political reasons, as well as
                    for economic reasons.”</p>
                <p>There was a united view in the U.S. Government that the trade deficit was a
                    problem and that it was unfair. Furthermore, unfortunately and sadly, the only
                    way to move the Japanese was to exert pressure on them. We would much prefer for
                    the Japanese to come to the conclusion that they should open up their markets in
                    their own self interest, not to have such a huge, global, trade surplus, as well
                    as a surplus with us, which was unbalanced in terms of the world economy. Above
                    all, we would like to see the Japanese Government persuade Japanese consumers
                    that a better life and better choice of goods could be available to them, and at
                    lower prices, by opening up their domestic markets.</p>
                <pb facs="0702" n="Page0702"/>
                <p>We had some hope that the Japanese Government might move in terms of their self
                    interest because of what seemed in 1993 and 1994 to be the beginning of some
                    political reforms in Japan. It seemed that the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party]
                    wasn't going to be totally dominant. Indeed, in 1993 the LDP was voted out of
                    office, and the Japanese opposition took over the government. We thought that
                    if, in fact, Japan would become not just a democracy but a two and three party
                    democracy, this meant that Japanese politicians would genuinely have to compete
                    for votes and that the domestic consumer in Japan would insist on having a
                    better life and a better choice of goods at cheaper prices. This, in turn, would
                    lead to more competition in the political area, as opposed to domination of the
                    system by one party. We thought that this might lead to pressures on the
                    politicians running for office to open up the Japanese market when they entered
                    office.</p>
                <p>This expectation turned out to be premature, because that just didn't happen. We
                    didn't like the fact that whenever you sought to make progress with Japan, you
                    had to bring matters to a head and create a crisis, because that presumably
                    meant that the Japanese Government would be seen as yielding to outside
                    pressure. This wasn't good for the overall relationship between Japan and the
                    United States. It soured the situation because it meant that, even if we
                    succeeded, there would be an after taste that could create a nationalistic
                    backlash in Japan.</p>
                <p>So we kept trying to appeal to Japanese self interest. However, the fact is that
                    this tactic hadn't worked with previous Japanese administrations and, by itself,
                    wasn't going to work with this administration. So we set out early on in the
                    Clinton administration to try to craft a different approach. Obviously, in many
                    ways the American economic agencies played a major role in this, as one might
                    expect. I can't say that the State Department maintained total control over our
                    approach to Japan. However, we were heavily involved in this approach, and, as
                    I've said, we didn't disagree fundamentally with the economic agencies of the
                    U.S. Government in this respect.</p>
                <p>By the time President Clinton went to Japan on his first trip there in July,
                    1993, we had been working hard on setting up a new approach to our trading
                    problems with Japan. I forget exactly what this approach was called, but it was
                    referred to as a framework agreement. This approach was announced in Tokyo. We
                    were there for the G-7 meeting but we were also there to deal with bilateral
                    problems. Basically, as I recall it, the agreement consisted of three
                    aspects.</p>
                <p>One of these involved macroeconomic considerations. We tried to make this as
                    mutual as possible, and each side act. For example, we had to have fiscal
                    discipline and attack our budget deficits. Clearly, it was aimed at opening up
                    the Japanese market to American exports. Here our emphasis was for Japan to
                    undertake greater domestic stimulus, expand Japanese imports, and generally take
                    more of our trade through fiscal stimulus and through deregulation. This was a
                    major issue in Japan.</p>
                <pb facs="0703" n="Page0703"/>
                <p>Secondly, progress was to be made in certain sectors, which were identified,
                    including automobiles, telecommunications, and so on. Here we got into a debate
                    over time on how much we would identify specific indicators to show progress
                    being made, after a year or two. Part of our problem was that there were a lot
                    of agreements with Japan entered into under previous American administrations,
                    which tended to be agreements in principle, but the implementation usually fell
                    short. We had no way of measuring whether or not we had success in this respect.
                    The big debate in Washington was whether and to what extent we could come up
                    with specific, measuring sticks. Japan felt that this approach involved locking
                    them into quotas that would either be politically difficult or would not be
                    acceptable. Or this would involve running the risk of the U.S. applying
                    sanctions if there wasn't enough progress made. So, over the next couple of
                    years, a lot of the negotiations with Japan involved how could we define
                    progress. On the whole we sort of came out, without being overly specific, with
                    measures to indicate progress, but without tying down the Japanese to specific
                    quotas. In a couple of sectors, percentages of their consumption were introduced
                    as targets.</p>
                <p>The third part of this framework agreement was included at the request of Japan.
                    It was called a common agenda, which was a program to attack global issues such
                    as the environment, drugs, and disaster relief. This agenda kept expanding over
                    the next couple of years. Actually, a lot of good work was done in that context.
                    However, despite our best efforts, we never had much attention paid to this
                    common agenda. People focused on the economic disputes. When things improved
                    somewhat, the common agenda wasn't sexy enough for people to pay much attention
                    to. However, throughout the four years of the first Clinton term, Tim Wirth
                    [Undersecretary for Global Affairs], as well as the rest of us, worked hard on
                    this. We tried to make progress on a lot of these issues and introduce a
                    positive element to this framework, as well as these tough, economic
                    measures.</p>
                <p>On a macro level, we in turn were committed to reducing our budget deficit. In
                    fact, we kept our part of the bargain over the coming years. So that was agreed
                    upon during the Clinton trip to Japan of July, 1993.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] Just to get down to the modalities involved, how did you deal with
                    the Japanese Government? There was just one party in power but there were
                    revolving governments and so forth. I was thinking that it would be very
                    difficult to pin anybody down. Could you talk about where you could go, in the
                    case of foreign and economic affairs, to get some continuity? Could you also
                    talk about the role of Ambassador Walter Mondale and the American Embassy in
                    Tokyo in this connection?</p>
                <pb facs="0704" n="Page0704"/>
                <p>LORD: On all of these matters it was obviously the Japanese Prime Minister that
                    we looked to. However, he didn't have the individual clout that, say, our
                    President would have in our government. The Japanese Prime Minister would always
                    have to rule by consensus within his party. The process of developing a
                    consensus could be slow moving. During the early period of the Clinton
                    administration Hashimoto was the Japanese trade negotiator with Mickey Kantor.
                    He was more dynamic than most Japanese leaders and then he became Prime
                    Minister. By the way, he was very good on security issues but was always tough
                    on economic issues.</p>
                <p>On security matters the Japanese Ministry of Defense isn't all that important.
                    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister are the key points of
                    contact on security affairs. When questions become sensitive, as they did over
                    the Okinawa rape case, new defense guidelines, or host nation support for our
                    defense budget, it really required the leadership of the Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>On trade matters, the Japanese trade negotiator in the initial phase was, of
                    course, Hashimoto. He was the key man. Obviously, he had to coordinate with the
                    Prime Minister, because you had to influence him.</p>
                <p>The Japanese bureaucracy is generally very influential. To this day, it controls
                    many issues, with the politicians coming and going, in and out of office. The
                    senior bureaucrats remain in place. The Ministry of Finance was generally pretty
                    conservative on these matters, as were the other Japanese economic agencies. We
                    also had to try to appeal, and did, though maybe not as effectively as we might
                    have done, to Japanese consumers and public opinion. We had to try to go over
                    the heads of the government leaders and to appeal to their own self interest. In
                    this way we hoped to increase what we saw as the momentum in support of possible
                    political reform, or put pressure on politicians to be responsive to consumer
                    needs.</p>
                <p>However, the quick answer to your question is that on security matters we dealt
                    with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Ministry. At times the Japanese Defense
                    Ministry was also involved. On economic matters, we dealt with the Prime
                    Minister and the trade negotiators from other financial and economic
                    institutions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Bernkopf] I think that Stu Kennedy also asked about the
                        role oAmbassador Walter Mondale.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0705" n="Page0705"/>
                <p>LORD: In my view Mondale was a very good Ambassador. From the beginning of his
                    assignment as Ambassador to Japan, he was determined to be very polite and
                    supportive in public, on the whole, but to be very firm privately with the
                    Japanese on economic issues and to speak candidly to them. What was refreshing
                    about Mondale was that he never suffered from clientitis. He always made clear
                    that he was working for the United States. Obviously, he would represent the
                    Japanese point of view to Washington, as any Ambassador should do. He would have
                    views on how to deal with the Japanese. However, he was very good at carrying
                    tough messages to the Japanese. He worked very hard and was firm in private,
                    even as he treated the Japanese publicly with great respect. You don't want an
                    Ambassador in Tokyo who simply bashes the Japanese, and you don't want someone
                    accused of clientitis. Mondale was neither.</p>
                <p>In all candor, many people felt that Ambassador Mike Mansfield was terrific as an
                    Ambassador early on. However, by the end of his term as Ambassador the American
                    business community felt that he wasn't tough enough with the Japanese on
                    economic issues. He began to lose his reputation in this regard. I think that
                    Ambassador Armacost was considered very good by the American business community.
                    However, some Japanese may have felt that he was a little abrasive in public,
                    although I didn't think so. I think that he was an excellent Ambassador. I'm
                    sure that Ambassador Mondale, building on the work of his predecessors, may have
                    appeared to be like Ambassador Mansfield in public. However, in private he was
                    like Armacost, firm and tough. I think that Mondale was successful in that. He
                    also had great clout in Washington, and with the President which he used
                    effectively without undercutting Secretary Christopher.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Mondale also brought tremendous, political instincts to the job which,
                    given his background, was only natural. These instincts served us very well at
                    key moments. For example, there was an incident where some Japanese students
                    were murdered in the U.S. Ambassador Mondale, without waiting for instructions,
                    went immediately to the Japanese press, apologizing to them over this incident
                    and defusing it. He did this also, and above all, on the rape incident in
                    Okinawa, which happened in 1995.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] Can you explain the background and what
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: A couple of U.S. Marines raped a Japanese woman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] I think that she was a very young girl.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Bernkopf] She was a 12 year old girl, in fact.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0706" n="Page0706"/>
                <p>LORD: She wasn't killed, but it was a particularly humiliating and terrible
                    situation. To this day it continues to hurt our defense relationship and could
                    have destroyed it entirely. Everybody worked hard on this, including Secretary
                    of State Christopher, Secretary of Defense Perry, and President Clinton.
                    However, Ambassador Mondale, without waiting for instructions, because he knew
                    that speed was necessary, arranged to appear on Japanese television and
                    apologized without even checking with Washington. He just knew that he had to
                    move quickly and visibly. So on this occasion and on others he was very good in
                    dealing with Japanese public opinion.</p>
                <p>Now, in his first year or two as Ambassador, he was frustrated because he felt,
                    even though he believed in pushing the Japanese hard on trade issues, that we
                    didn't have our act together back in Washington. Sometimes the USTR would be
                    saying one thing, and someone else would be saying something else. Even if there
                    was a general consensus, at least tactically it looked bad. He felt that we were
                    losing a public relations battle in Asia and around the world by going for
                    managed trade. This was ironic because Japan was essentially the party which was
                    going for managed trade. We were for free trade. But our use of specific
                    indicators lent itself to attacks. We were accused by the Japanese and many of
                    our Asian trading partners of trying to promote artificial trade. We were
                    accused by some people in the U.S. who were worried about security that we were
                    risking our security ties with Japan because of economic considerations. They
                    felt that we were going about this matter in the wrong way.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Ambassador Mondale felt, and correctly, that we weren't handling this
                    matter correctly in terms of public relations. Also, he felt that tactically we
                    were not speaking cohesively and that some of our approaches, such as overly
                    strict, numerical targets, were actually wrong. He felt that this was the wrong
                    way to go about it. So, for a variety of reasons, Ambassador Mondale was on the
                    phone to Washington a lot, talking in particular to Joan Spero, the Under
                    Secretary of State for Economic Affairs and we; Secretary of State Christopher;
                    the White House; Mickey Kantor [USTR]; Ron Brown [Secretary of Commerce]; and
                    other key economic players. Mondale tried to develop more cohesion and more
                    sense in our policies with Japan.</p>
                <p>I think that Ambassador Mondale felt frustrated, as many of us also did, during
                    the first two years of the first Clinton term. However, by the time he left
                    Tokyo, he felt very good, indeed, after the triumphant, Presidential trip to
                    Japan at the end of the first Clinton term. So Ambassador Mondale was an
                    important player. People knew of his political clout, if he went to the
                    President, as he would do from time to time, but only selectively. He wouldn't
                    overdo that access. Mondale was very helpful. Both Joan Spero and I worked very
                    closely with him. We would be in touch with him fairly regularly, trying to keep
                    Mondale posted, and not just through the usual cables. We would get on the
                    telephone or use sensitive back channels and try to coordinate with Ambassador
                    Mondale on strategy and tactics.</p>
                <pb facs="0707" n="Page0707"/>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] What were your relations with Mickey Kantor, the U.S. Trade
                    Representative [USTR]? In the press he has been portrayed as being a very
                    aggressive, New York type, or something of this nature. I would have thought
                    that there would be a problem between the nuanced State Department style and the
                    Mickey Kantor style.</p>
                <p>LORD: That would be a fair supposition. I know that it may look suspicious
                    because I'm being nice to everybody, and that is my instinct when I am speaking
                    on the record, but I'm a genuine admirer of Mickey Kantor, although there were
                    times when his tactics left something to be desired. For example, after a caning
                    incident in Singapore [when a young American was administered with several
                    strokes of a rattan stick, pursuant to a Singapore court order because he
                    possessed narcotics], he opposed agreeing to Singapore being the world
                    headquarters of the World Trade Organization [WHO]. He didn't check with
                    anybody, and we had to roll that one back. I helped to do that. There were times
                    when Kantor wasn't careful enough in his public remarks with respect to Japan.
                    In my view these were essentially nit picks, compared to his overall
                    performance.</p>
                <p>I thought that, even though he got into some trouble and may have had some
                    stylistic shortcomings, on the whole Kantor and Barshevsky, his deputy, were
                    extremely able. I wouldn't exaggerate the progress we made on trade agreements,
                    and some people could say that we paid a price for this. The fact is that we
                    negotiated 23 different trade agreements during this period. The key point was
                    that the trade deficit with Japan began to decline. I felt that Mickey Kantor
                    had the practice of being willing to compromise at the last minute. He was tough
                    but he wasn't stubborn to the point of giving up on trade deals. I thought that
                    we made some progress on trade, even though, from the public relations point of
                    view, we did poorly with our Asian and domestic audiences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] When you mention PR, did this mean that we were
                        seen ajust beating up on Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. Of course, this was welcomed in some quarters. Those who were worried
                    about the trade deficit and those who had been frustrated in their dealings with
                    Japan, some of them in the business community and some labor figures, supported
                    this. Others, who put their emphasis on geopolitics and security, would still
                    feel that we were exaggerating the importance of this issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0708" n="Page0708"/>
                <p>This may have reflected a left over of attitudes from the Cold War. During the
                    Cold War, if we had a trade problem with Japan, the State and Defense
                    Departments and the JCS [Joint Chiefs of Staff] would go to the White House and
                    say: “Look, Japan is a key ally. We are engaged around the world in a struggle
                    with the Soviet Union. We can't afford to 'mess this up' with petty economic
                    problems.” In effect, they would tell the economic agencies to get lost. Well,
                    in addition to other reasons we felt that the greater role being played by
                    economic developments in foreign policy, something which President Clinton
                    clearly felt strongly about, and the relationship between the domestic economy
                    and the global economy meant that economics had to have a higher priority. But
                    there were some people who still thought that we were sacrificing our security
                    ties with Japan, even though we tried to insulate them and indeed succeeded in
                    doing so.</p>
                <p>Then there were others who agreed on the urgency of the economic problems between
                    the U.S. and Japan but felt that we were handling them in the wrong way. They
                    felt that we were either involved in too much public bashing of Japan in terms
                    of the numerical, fixed targets for trade we were trying to achieve, or we
                    didn't know whether we could reach these targets anyway. They tended to think
                    that these targets were somewhat artificial and were too close to managed trade.
                    There was a variety of reasons why some people were not pleased with our
                    approach to trade negotiations with Japan.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] Here was a situation where the balance of trade was seen as THE top
                    issue with these countries when you became Assistant Secretary for East Asian
                    and Pacific Affairs, more or less.</p>
                <p>LORD: It was a big issue in terms of there being problems and controversy, as
                    well as tough negotiations. Therefore, these attracted media attention. As I
                    tried to say, we worked assiduously on security ties and political
                    consultations, but did not attract much attention, and perhaps understandably
                    so. The problems on the security side and our common agenda on global issues
                    were quieter and less controversial. The common agenda also involved our working
                    together with Japan at the UN, on regional security, regional economic
                    relations, and so on. There is no question that the trade issue between the
                    United States and Japan was front and center. As I said earlier, we had a four
                    year plan. We felt that we might have some friction during the first couple of
                    years but we hoped that, by the end of four years, things would be better on the
                    trade and economic front and therefore in the overall relationship.</p>
                <p>First, we had to get the trade deficit down and the market more open. I say down.
                    We knew that we weren't going to eliminate the trade deficit. We were trying to
                    get the trend going in a different direction.</p>
                <pb facs="0709" n="Page0709"/>
                <p>Secondly, we strengthened Japan-U.S. security ties. Thirdly, we increased
                    cooperation with Japan on regional and global issues. If you look over this four
                    year period, I think that we did quite well. We strengthened the security
                    relationship, which was capped off by President Clinton's trip to Japan in 1996.
                    We had also made some progress on the trade deficit and we had greatly expanded
                    our agenda with Japan.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] With all of the attention paid by the Departments of State, the
                    Treasury, and others, and as we look at this situation with considerable
                    hindsight as we are looking at this now, in 1998, we can see a horrendous
                    problem with the Japanese economy. I'm thinking in particular of bad loans, bad
                    investments, and all that. Did any of our agencies say: “Really, the Japanese
                    aren't doing very well with their economy.” Or were we so focused elsewhere that
                    we weren't looking at that?</p>
                <p>LORD: That's a very good question. First, I'll answer it more directly. The
                    reason that we had this three-part, framework agreement was that the Japanese
                    wanted positive cooperation on global issues. They wanted a “common agenda.” So
                    that was inserted, and we had no problem with that.</p>
                <p>The Treasury Department felt that the key area was in the field of
                    macroeconomics. This meant fiscal stimulus and deregulation. In its view, over
                    time this would make more of a difference than slugging it out on different
                    sectors and inching along here and there. The USTR felt that it was great to
                    have attention paid to macroeconomics, but there were a few areas where we
                    really had a comparative advantage, and the Japanese were particularly
                    unreasonable on them. The Commerce Department, too, felt that we had to make
                    progress on economic grounds, as well as domestic political grounds, in these
                    areas, like automobiles and telecommunications. So that's why we had those three
                    segments in the approach.</p>
                <p>To answer your question, we were still essentially in the syndrome of regarding
                    the Japanese as having an extremely strong economy, although we were also in a
                    transition period. We now know, as we sit here in the summer of 1998, that even
                    by the beginning of the Clinton administration, the Japanese economy was
                    beginning to level off and stagnate. Banking and real estate problems were
                    beginning to take hold. After all, the Japanese have essentially been in a
                    recession for seven years. So that goes back to the beginning of the Clinton
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>Having said that, I do not recall that there was much notice taken of the
                    condition of the Japanese economy. By the mid to late 1990s we had somewhat
                    moved beyond the view that Japan was 10 feet tall and we were pygmies. In the
                    1980s, books were coming out which said that the U.S. had to be more like Japan.
                    The view was that we have to have lifetime employment and an educational system
                    like that of the Japanese. A number of views like this were expressed.</p>
                <pb facs="0710" n="Page0710"/>
                <p>By the time the Clinton administration came into office [in 1993], American
                    companies had become leaner, meaner, and more competitive. We knew that, and
                    this process continued throughout his first term as President. Our budget
                    deficit was still a problem, although after a couple of years we began to get
                    that down. So we were in a psychological mood where we were not feeling so weak
                    ourselves, as we had felt during the mid-1980s, when we thought that Japan was
                    going to dwarf us and gobble us up and that we had to imitate them. We were
                    getting more self confident about American business opportunities. Therefore,
                    there was all the more reason for Japan to be fair in opening up its markets,
                    because now we could really compete with them.</p>
                <p>Previously, part of the problem was that even if Japan opened up its markets, our
                    businessmen didn't speak Japanese and didn't have patience. We didn't make
                    automobiles that had steering wheels on the right hand side, as automobiles do
                    in Japan. However, now we felt that American business was doing its job and was
                    ready to compete in Japan, if the Japanese would open up their market. We could
                    be more competitive generally, including sales of rice and meat. Therefore,
                    there was all the more reason for us to press Japan.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, we didn't have a sense of Japan's weakness. As you say, this
                    process was already beginning to take hold. We had thought that we were dealing
                    with a very strong partner. I don't remember any discussions focusing on the
                    fact that the Japanese weren't all that powerful. But that was a good question
                    you asked.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] You talked about how Ambassador Mondale reacted to Japan. However,
                    the Okinawa rape problem had horrendous repercussions in Japan. Can you tell us
                    how the news came to you and how the Departments of State and Defense responded?
                    After all, everybody in the U.S. Government was involved in all of this.</p>
                <p>LORD: First, let me finish off on the economic side. I don't have a precise
                    recollection of this. After the framework agreement was reached in July, 1993,
                    we then began tough negotiations to implement it. By the time Japanese Prime
                    Minister Hosokawa came to Washington in February, 1994, we'd really reached an
                    impasse and hadn't made much progress. We said that we should make progress
                    within the next year, fleshing out the framework agreement. We had made some
                    progress on the global agenda items. It was less controversial to work on them.
                    On macroeconomics, things were not going well. President Clinton and Prime
                    Minister Hosokawa did not try to cover this up.</p>
                <pb facs="0711" n="Page0711"/>
                <p>So this was part of the general malaise in our Asian policy, which I was talking
                    about in the spring of 1994. Prime Minister Hosokawa made a trip to Washington,
                    at the end of which Clinton and Hosokawa held a joint press conference. Although
                    the conference was polite, as the Japanese generally are in their diplomacy, it
                    was clear that we had not succeeded in the intervening months on the economic
                    front. The other parts of the Japanese-American agenda were positive, but the
                    whole press coverage of that summit meeting reflected a failure to make progress
                    on the economic front.</p>
                <p>We kept at it. Our strategy, in addition to continuing to press on fleshing out
                    the framework agreement, was based on the view that, over time, APEC and the WTO
                    [World Trade Organization] would put multilateral pressure on Japan to open up
                    its market. But that wasn't going to solve our short term problems with Japan.
                    Again, as with all Asian economic problems, we looked on the economic
                    negotiations with Japan on three levels, bilateral, regional, and global. That
                    is, bilateral, depending on the partner. In the case of China and Japan we faced
                    some tough negotiations. There were regional negotiations, in this case through
                    APEC. Over time, particularly as we reached the goals of free trade and
                    investment by a date certain, there were multilateral pressures to bring to bear
                    and not just the U.S. bugging other countries to open their markets. Then there
                    were global negotiations in the Uruguay Round and the WTO.</p>
                <p>In any event we began to make progress. I can't remember right now, but probably
                    part of the reason for this progress was due to the yen-dollar exchange
                    relationship, which always affects the trade. This is true even now. Our trade
                    deficit gets worse when the yen is relatively weak and the U.S. dollar is
                    strong. We made some concrete progress, perhaps not as much as might have
                    appeared, because we emphasized it and perhaps excessively. However, the
                    progress made was a lot more than our critics admitted. The U.S. trade deficit
                    was going down, and U.S. exports to Japan were going up. We had statistics to
                    show that at least in some areas, if not across the board, our exports were
                    going up faster in the areas where we had negotiated agreements than was
                    generally the case in other areas. In some areas, such as automobiles, we really
                    didn't make too much progress, although we made some.</p>
                <p>Over time we made enough progress on the economic front, perhaps helped by the
                    dollar-yen exchange rate, as well as the trade negotiations, so that by the end
                    of the first Clinton term the trade deficit was going in the right direction.
                    That was coupled with progress on the security and other fronts. This put our
                    relationship with Japan in great shape by the time President Clinton went to
                    Japan in April 1996.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] How did you use President Clinton or, perhaps, how did President
                    Clinton use you as an instrument in these negotiations? Now it had been arranged
                    that the President was going to see the Japanese Prime Minister twice a year, at
                    least, in the context of the G-7 meeting and in the bilateral...</p>
                <pb facs="0712" n="Page0712"/>
                <p>LORD: It had been agreed that there would be a bilateral summit meeting once a
                    year. In fact, there were meetings more or less firmly scheduled between the
                    President and the Japanese Prime Minister three times a year, in the context of
                    APEC, the G-7 meeting, and a bilateral summit meeting.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] Obviously, this was the main consideration. How did President
                    Clinton deal with this series of meetings with the Japanese Prime Minister?</p>
                <p>LORD: These meetings were always high on President Clinton's agenda. To be
                    totally candid, I always thought, and I felt that others did, too, that when he
                    got into a meeting with his counterparts, President Clinton wasn't as tough as
                    he might have been. He was correct, he was polite, and he emphasized the
                    positive side of our relationship. He always raised the economic issues and
                    spent quite a bit of time on them, but I think that there were times when he
                    edged more toward a polite formulation than what was needed. With the Japanese
                    you can and should be firmer with them when you are in a one on one meeting than
                    when you are with them in the presence of others. This is a matter of face with
                    Asians, particularly with the Japanese.</p>
                <p>I'm not saying that President Clinton should have been rude or pounded the table,
                    in his contacts with the Japanese. However, I can remember some meetings where
                    he should have been firmer. I was at virtually all of his meetings with the
                    Japanese. Sometimes a meeting would be small and would be followed by a larger
                    meeting. I attended both large and small meetings. At times President Clinton
                    would go off alone with the Japanese Prime Minister when he had a really tough
                    message to convey. On balance, I'm not sure that it would have made a huge
                    difference if Clinton had been tougher. Given the Japanese negotiating system, I
                    think that it probably wouldn't have made much difference.</p>
                <p>I might add that, throughout this period, particularly in 1994, 1995, and 1996,
                    Secretary of State Christopher worked very hard on our bilateral ties.
                    Essentially, he met with Japanese Foreign Minister Kono but also with Foreign
                    Minister Ikeda toward the end. He sought to try to manage the overall Japan-U.S.
                    relationship. Christopher and his Japanese counterpart would meet several times
                    a year. Either Secretary of State Christopher would visit Japan or vice versa or
                    there would be meetings around the edges of APEC, ARF, or G-7 meetings.</p>
                <pb facs="0713" n="Page0713"/>
                <p>Christopher would almost always meet with his Japanese counterpart, and with my
                    encouragement he would go over a whole agenda of issues. He tried to do
                    essentially two things. First, to make clear to the Japanese that the Department
                    of State was on board with the USTR, the Treasury Department, the Commerce
                    Department, etc., and the White House about the need to make progress on
                    economic issues. He would press hard on those issues and would be on the phone a
                    great deal in between meetings. He would try to appeal for help on some of these
                    difficult negotiations. At the same time he would go over all of the issues on
                    which we had positive relations, to make clear how important other parts of our
                    relationship were, and to try to expand the areas of agreement, whether they
                    involved security problems or two plus two meetings where we actually had the
                    Secretaries of State and Defense sitting down with their Japanese
                    counterparts.</p>
                <p>We had several of the two plus two meetings and we expanded the common agenda
                    generally, as well as talking about UN peacekeeping, Korea, Cambodia etc. On
                    Korea we launched the process - at Christopher's level and mine - of trilateral
                    consultations between Japan, Korea, and the U.S.</p>
                <p>So I think that Secretary Christopher had some positive effect on the
                    Japanese-American relationship, making sure that even during rocky moments of
                    trade negotiations that the relationship was kept on keel, as far as possible.
                    Of course, President Clinton worked at this as well. And Secretary Perry was
                    terrific on security issues. For all of these reasons, by 1996 we had put the
                    Japanese-American relationship back on track. The big issue, of course, was
                    security on Okinawa. We can cover that now, if you like.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] One other thing we might consider first. You were talking about
                    these meetings between President Clinton and the Japanese Prime Minister. The
                    were two problems in this connection. One was the relatively large number of
                    Japanese Prime Ministers involved, since they were only in office for a few
                    months.</p>
                <p>LORD: Right.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] Every six months to a year, it seemed, there was a different
                    Japanese Prime Minister in office. This made it tough because it was impossible
                    to develop the experience of dealing with a single Prime Minister. Politicians
                    can cover this kind of ground pretty quickly, but, still, this is putting a
                    strain on the getting to know you system.</p>
                <p>LORD: Let me say that that is a very good point because, as we discussed before,
                    obviously, national interest determines your position, but if you can meet with
                    your counterpart over time and build up a certain relationship of trust, so that
                    you can handle some business over the telephone or empathize with the other
                    person's domestic, political problems, this can help a relationship develop
                    around the edges as it were.</p>
                <pb facs="0714" n="Page0714"/>
                <p>We've seen this with the China relationship, where the President first had a
                    stiff and unsatisfactory relationship with Jiang Zemin, but over the course of
                    several years and several meetings, that contact has gotten easier, and I think
                    that it's helped the relationship to develop.</p>
                <p>You are absolutely right that playing a game of musical chairs with a succession
                    of Japanese Prime Ministers certainly complicated our problem.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] Did you work on the President and Warren Christopher or did you get
                    your Japanese experts to encourage them to be sensitive and understand the
                    Japanese way of approaching things? Did this get in the way?</p>
                <p>LORD: I don't think so. Christopher's inherent style would be polite and
                    respectful, so that would play well with the Japanese. But he could be tough
                    when he had to be. President Clinton is very quick at understanding cultural
                    differences. As a real, master politician, he is very good at putting himself in
                    the shoes of his counterpart and understanding what his counterpart needs
                    domestically.</p>
                <p>I think that, stylistically, there was no problem. You could argue that there was
                    a problem in the case of Mickey Kantor, although Prime Minister Hashimoto was
                    not all of that different from Kantor. But you could argue that Kantor was a
                    little too blunt, frontal, and occasionally brutal, compared to some of the
                    others. On the other hand, unfortunately, in my experience, you have to
                    calibrate your style with the Japanese. You have to be pretty firm with them, or
                    they just won't move. As I said earlier, it is clear that they would move out of
                    their own self interest, rather than in response to foreign pressure. However,
                    often, they may know that they should move, but they rely on foreign pressure as
                    an excuse to get themselves to move. That's very unfortunate.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] Shall we move on to the situation in Okinawa? In Washington how did
                    we deal with security problems generally involving our armed forces which were
                    deployed in East Asia, when the Okinawa rape incident occurred?</p>
                <p>LORD: My memory and lack of files will make it difficult for me to bvery
                    responsive, I'm afraid.</p>
                <p>First, security considerations, as I've said, were a crucial area for us in Japan
                    and for our whole presence in Asia. At Defense Department initiative and with
                    strong coordination from the Department of State at all levels, in addition to
                    support from me, my deputies and Ambassador Mondale, and with support at the
                    cabinet level, we launched a joint Defense-State dialogue with the Japanese at
                    various levels. We set up committees at different levels to talk about our
                    defense needs, and to coordinate on regional security policy. We undertook a
                    division of responsibilities. We did this as an end in itself and because we
                    hadn't had this exhaustive a look at security issues since the 1970s. With the
                    end of the Cold War and in view of all of the other changes in the world, we
                    clearly had to update and reaffirm our alliance with Japan.</p>
                <pb facs="0715" n="Page0715"/>
                <p>We did this to make sure that trade disputes, which we knew would inevitably come
                    up when we set out on this review, would not spill over into the security area.
                    So we already were working very hard on this. I can't give you specific dates on
                    when this process was actually launched and when committee meetings were held.
                    This was always a joint State-Defense operation, but I want to give full credit
                    to the Department of Defense. We were making progress when the Okinawa rape
                    incident occurred.</p>
                <p>This case, as I've said, involved two Marines who were abusing a very young girl.
                    This caused a tremendous uproar in Japan. As I said, Ambassador Mondale moved in
                    on this immediately with an apology. From then on Defense Secretary Perry was
                    superb, going to Japan and working with the Japanese Government. His deputies,
                    like Joe Nye, worked closely with us. Ambassador Mondale worked very sensitively
                    with the Japanese.</p>
                <p>This incident precipitated a furor about the American base presence in Japan and
                    our troops there. Okinawa, of course, had a disproportionate number of our
                    defense bases and a substantial number of American troops deployed. I don't have
                    the exact numbers of our troops present on Okinawa at the time of this incident.
                    I think that Okinawa had something like 75 percent of all of our military bases
                    in Japan, including a large number of Marines at our facilities in Okinawa, as
                    opposed to other parts of Japan. So there was a dual problem. It wasn't only a
                    U.S.-Japanese problem involving our base presence and the sensitivity involved
                    in that, when Japanese citizens suffered from inconvenience, noise, pollution,
                    and, above all, traffic accidents in which Japanese people were killed. Now we
                    had to deal with the misbehavior of American service people.</p>
                <p>There was also a second problem, involving tension between Tokyo and the Japanese
                    provincial government in Okinawa. The Okinawans felt that they were carrying the
                    brunt of the inconveniences of the American presence and that Tokyo politicians,
                    as they weren't on the island, thought that they could let the Okinawans worry
                    about it. On the mainland of Japan these politicians were not disposed to carry
                    the full burden, for political reasons. So a lot of this involved negotiations
                    between the Prime Minister of Japan in Tokyo and Okinawan authorities about the
                    division of labor and the economic help provided to Okinawa to compensate
                    Okinawans for the burdens that they were carrying.</p>
                <p>There was a provincial governor in Okinawa who is still there to this day. He has
                    been pressing this issue on a nationalistic basis. He wants the U.S. forces out
                    of Okinawa by a date certain. He continues to press for a reduction of our
                    forces in Okinawa. I met with him a couple of times when he came to Washington.
                    Then there was Japanese Prime Minister Hashimoto, who was excellent on this
                    issue and moved with considerable courage. He tried to work with us to defuse
                    this issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0716" n="Page0716"/>
                <p>I don't have the chronology immediately available, but we soon launched a process
                    called SACO, whose purpose was to look at our overall base presence in Japan.
                    The terms of reference were set up to make clear that both sides felt that the
                    continued presence of American forces in Okinawa was in their national interest.
                    So, from the point of view of the Japanese Government, there was no question of
                    removing U.S. forces from Okinawa. Rather, the purpose of this review was to see
                    whether any consolidation of American forces could take place, as well as any
                    diminution of inconveniences like noise and pollution, accidents, and the use of
                    land. We also sought to determine whether there could be any relief of the
                    disproportionate burden on Okinawa resulting from the U.S. presence, and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>So, in addition to an apology by Ambassador Mondale over the rape incident, we
                    needed to make sure that the trial of the Marines took place, that they received
                    the proper punishment, and that the President extend his own apologies. In
                    addition to apologies by American cabinet officials over the rape incident, we
                    also launched a process of looking again at our military presence on Okinawa. We
                    had been engaged in desultory talks during several administrations over whether
                    we really needed every last facility on Okinawa. For example, did we really need
                    to fire artillery rounds across roads, did we really need to make night flights
                    that wake people up in the middle of the night. In short, did we need all of
                    this? In fact, we couldn't persuade the Pentagon to move overtly on this matter
                    because they didn't have much of a sense of urgency.</p>
                <p>Well, the rape incident precipitated the sense of urgency. Our whole military
                    presence could suffer if we didn't show good faith efforts really to move on
                    these longstanding issues of consolidation and reduction of base facilities.</p>
                <pb facs="0717" n="Page0717"/>
                <p>To get this process moving, Secretary of Defense Perry set up a system of
                    coordination with the State Department, including a coordination mechanism of
                    committees going up to the cabinet level and time tables during which this was
                    to be done. He worked very hard on this. To make a long story short, a lot of
                    progress was made. The key issue included a major base in Okinawa, called
                    Kadena, which was a particular imposition on the Okinawan people because of
                    safety and noise. There were bloody battles on this issue, with Secretary Perry,
                    Joe Nye, and others being very tough with the military services. Other people,
                    like Kurt Campbell, when he came in, were also involved. Perry sought to reach
                    an agreement among the services to relocate Kadena, in exchange for Prime
                    Minister Hashimoto agreeing to find another kind of base to make up for whatever
                    capability we were losing with the relocation. We kept stressing to the
                    Japanese, particularly Prime Minister Hashimoto, that having our bases
                    (relocated and consolidated) had to be portrayed, not just as a favor that the
                    Japanese were doing us, but that it was in Japan's national interest. This
                    approach was well received by Prime Minister Hashimoto, who was good on this
                    issue. With our bases in Japan, the Japanese didn't have to go nuclear. They had
                    our security cover. Perry also stressed that point in the tough negotiations he
                    had with the Okinawan authorities. The negotiations went on, and we had the
                    attention gathering mechanism of the Presidential visit coming up. President
                    Clinton was due to arrive in Japan in April, 1996. Just before then, Perry went
                    to Japan and consolidated the basic agreement to make it possible to defuse that
                    issue before the President arrived, so that there would be no negotiations while
                    he was there. I went with Perry on this visit. As a result, there was an easy
                    atmosphere before the Summit Meeting. This allowed the Summit Meeting to
                    concentrate on our relationship across the board, plus reaffirming our defense
                    alliance and reviewing our defense guidelines. The implementation process went
                    forward over the next few months.</p>
                <p>Also during this period the Japanese held firm, in a statesmanlike way, on how
                    much they would pay to support the U.S. bases. This was the most generous
                    agreement by far with any ally, amounting to something like $5.0 billion a year.
                    We reached an agreement, under which that arrangement would continue for several
                    years. This was negotiated mostly by my deputy, Tom Hubbard and Kurt Campbell,
                    as well as their colleagues in the Departments of Defense and State. At times,
                    Joe Nye and I would meet with the Japanese; at times, Nye would be on his own.
                    Then there were occasional two plus two meetings around the edges in New York,
                    during the UN General Assembly session, or in Tokyo, when Secretary of State
                    Christopher and Secretary of Defense Perry would meet with their counterparts at
                    various stages of the process. This turned out very well.</p>
                <p>This was a very major challenge throughout this period, particularly during the
                    last two or three years. However, it came out extremely well. We reaffirmed the
                    Japan-United States alliance, we updated our defense guidelines, we strengthened
                    the partnership in general, and the Japanese continued their host nation
                    support. We had a very positive outcome for the President's visit to Japan in
                    April, 1996.</p>
                <pb facs="0718" n="Page0718"/>
                <p>I might mention a footnote here. The President was originally due to go to Japan
                    to attend an APEC meeting in Osaka in November, 1995 as well as a state visit.
                    By then the Japan-U.S. defense relationship was looking a lot better. We had
                    done a lot of work on the new reaffirmation of the Japan-U.S. defense
                    relationship, plus the defense guidelines. I should make the point that since
                    the 1970s we had had guidelines on how we operated with Japan, but these
                    basically considered what would happen if Japan were attacked and how we would
                    work together in such a case. The world had changed greatly since then. Clearly,
                    we had to look at issues involving regional problems, the situation in Korea,
                    and what Japan might do beside ensuring its immediate defense. So we covered a
                    lot of sensitive issues about what to do if Japan were involved in a pre-crisis
                    situation and what to do if something broke out. A lot of this was fleshed out
                    after I left office as Assistant Secretary. This expanded Japan's regional
                    responsibilities, without letting Japan take on responsibilities that would
                    scare its Asian neighbors. So the Japanese became more committed to refueling
                    U.S. forces in Japan, allowing the use of air and naval bases automatically in
                    emergency circumstances, mine sweeping, as well as Japan's usual, defensive
                    efforts, are other examples of what we accomplished. At least there was quick
                    agreement on some of these contingencies.</p>
                <p>The most contentious part was where did the guidelines apply. The Chinese have
                    been complaining that these guidelines might apply to Taiwan. Both we and the
                    Japanese cleverly agreed not to confirm that. We agreed not to rule out the
                    defense of Taiwan, in case China becomes aggressive and attacks. We agreed not
                    to be provocative toward China or say that the guidelines covered what the
                    Chinese considered their territory. So we neither confirmed nor denied that the
                    defense guidelines covered this. In effect, we said that this relates to
                    situations, not geographic entities. We danced around this matter and we're
                    going to continue to do so. The Chinese continue to press us and the Japanese to
                    exclude Taiwan. Of course, neither we nor the Japanese will do that. We wish to
                    deter Beijing's use of force without being provocative.</p>
                <p>Now, a footnote on the Osaka meeting of APEC. The President was due to go there
                    in November, 1995, for the APEC meeting, but also to make another, bilateral
                    trip to Japan. We had a budget crisis back here in the United States, which
                    preoccupied the President. Rumors began to fly around Washington a week or two
                    weeks before the President's scheduled departure on this trip that he might have
                    to cancel or postpone the trip. I thought that this was unthinkable. First, it
                    would be unthinkably wrong, but I also didn't believe that this was going to
                    happen. However, I had enough doubts on this score, that I decided in perhaps a
                    naive way, at my level, to lock this trip in - as much as I could, as if an
                    Assistant Secretary of State can lock in the White House.</p>
                <pb facs="0719" n="Page0719"/>
                <p>At this time I was setting up a press briefing at the Foreign Press Center on the
                    President's trip. I usually met with them to preview a trip by the President or
                    Secretary. I went on record, and some of my colleagues were a little uneasy
                    about this, because I was concerned that the President was going to cancel the
                    trip. I just said flatly that it was unthinkable that the President would
                    cancel. This would be a “disaster” (perhaps I used a milder phrase) for our
                    relations with Japan, as well as our general relations in Asia, for the process
                    of APEC and the Leaders' Meeting which the President helped to start. It would
                    be a real blow to our general Asia-Pacific policies if the President didn't go.
                    I said of course the President was going to go. Well, a week later he canceled
                    the trip.</p>
                <p>I will mention a little footnote here. I have since learned, and I don't know
                    whether it's true or not, that the day when the President either met or
                    allegedly began fooling around with Monica Lewinsky was the very day when he
                    canceled his trip to Japan. [Ms. Lewinsky was a White House staff aide at the
                    time. Later, the President said publicly that he had had an improper
                    relationship with her.] The President said that the cancellation of the trip was
                    for budgetary reasons. I'd like to think that there is no connection between the
                    affair with Ms. Lewinsky and the cancellation of the trip to Japan, although I
                    don't know whether there was such a connection. I am not presuming the
                    President's guilt or innocence in this regard, but it was a horrible
                    coincidence. I think that he met her for the first time on that day.I pulled no
                    punches in saying how disastrous I thought the cancellation of the trip would
                    be. I probably overstated it. I was just going through State Department files
                    yesterday and found a memo I had written after the Osaka APEC meeting. I sent
                    this memo to Secretary Christopher and said, in effect, that the cancellation of
                    this trip had really hurt us in Asia and that it would take some time to repair
                    it, for all of the reasons that I had predicted in the first place.</p>
                <p>So Vice President Gore went to the meeting in place of the President and did as
                    well as he could have done under the circumstances, both for APEC and for our
                    bilateral relations with Japan. The Japanese were very mad about this
                    cancellation, and all of the APEC heads of government said that this incident
                    just showed that President Clinton didn't care about Asia. Despite our emphasis
                    on Asia and the general success we had had in raising the level of APEC, the
                    fact is that Secretary Christopher had earlier canceled out on a trip because of
                    Bosnia, the Middle East, or some such place. Christopher had to leave early from
                    a regional security meeting and canceled a trip to Australia, which made the
                    Australians mad. So this cancellation of Clinton's trip to Japan was another
                    echo of that. This was repaired and, by the time of the next APEC meeting, it
                    was forgotten. Moreover, in April, 1996, Clinton had his tremendously positive
                    trip to Japan.</p>
                <pb facs="0720" n="Page0720"/>
                <p>I mention this incident in this context because we already had pretty strong
                    U.S.-Japan agreement on the reaffirmation of our security relationship with
                    Japan and the defense guidelines, and the Okinawa issue was in pretty good
                    shape. So we would have had a successful Summit Meeting in Osaka. However, it
                    turned out that between November, 1995, and the President's April, 1996 trip to
                    Japan, the Taiwan missile crisis developed. The missile crisis unnerved the
                    Japanese. As a result, we got a stronger defense statement and greater movement
                    on the defense guidelines, as well as probably an easier time on the Okinawa
                    issue, because of the intervening events.</p>
                <p>Some people feel that we got these improvements only because of the Taiwan
                    missile crisis. This is not true. By November, 1995, we already would have had a
                    good agreement and summit. However, there is no question that we used the
                    intervening time, not to mention the Taiwan missile crisis, to strengthen that
                    whole package further. So the President's visit to Japan in the spring of 1996
                    was more successful than it would have been in November, 1995. There was a
                    silver lining somewhere.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] While we are talking about defense developments, did the issue of
                    ships carrying nuclear weapons or the storage of nuclear weapons come up at this
                    time?</p>
                <p>LORD: It never came up. Earlier, when I had been working in State and Defense and
                    with Kissinger in the White House, this had been a sensitive issue. It was
                    always amazing how Japanese leaders would dance around and neither confirm nor
                    deny the presence of nuclear weapons in Japan. I don't recall its being an issue
                    throughout the four-year period, when I was Assistant Secretary of State. It
                    seemed to be pretty well behind us.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] Did we get involved over - I'm not sure what you call them - or did
                    we just sit back and relax over the Northern Islands [Kuril Islands] problem?
                    I'm not sure that that is what you call them. They are located between Japan and
                    Russia.</p>
                <pb facs="0721" n="Page0721"/>
                <p>LORD: We supported the Japanese position on those islands. We were clear on that.
                    We supported Japan both privately and publicly on this matter. We called for an
                    improvement in relations between Japan and Russia. Every now and then someone
                    would surface with the stupid idea that we mediate on this issue. How can you
                    mediate something when you have already taken one side's position? I've never
                    understood that. We spent some time on that issue, and I worked with Strobe
                    Talbot [Deputy Secretary of State] on trying to improve relations between Japan
                    and Russia. We tried to introduce this matter in our talks with the Russians to
                    gain some perspective on this issue. I might add that during my four years as
                    Assistant Secretary I engaged in bilateral consultations on Asia with the
                    Russians. I went to Moscow twice, and Russian officials came to the U.S. once or
                    twice to discuss Asian issues across the board. The feeling was that we were
                    moving with China and Japan on regional security issues in general. Russia was a
                    Pacific power which had specific interests in Korea, and it had relations with
                    all of these other countries. Russia had potential economic interests and a
                    desire for investment. They wanted to get into APEC and into the ASEAN Regional
                    Forum [ARF]. I felt that Russia was a legitimate, important player, and one way
                    that we could deal with them, particularly when they weren't in the other
                    organizations yet, was to have these bilateral consultations.</p>
                <p>I also pressed for Russian entrance into the ASEAN Regional Forum,and I helped to
                    get them into ARF, as well as China and India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] Well, I was wondering. I started with the status
                        of thNorthern Islands.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Oh, yes. Without being belligerent about them and certainly recognizing
                    that these islands involved something that Yeltsin couldn't resolve overnight,
                    we made clear that we supported the Japanese position on that territory.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] Now, before we leave Japan and U.S. relations with Japan, were there
                    any issues in the Middle East, in the United Nations, or anywhere else on which
                    we were either working with Japan or colluding with Japan. Also, in connection
                    with the United Nations, were we involved in giving Japan one of the permanent
                    Security Council seats?</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, we of course supported them on this issue and still do, by virtue of
                    Japan's weight and financial contributions which are important on the world and
                    regional scene. We've supported Japan and Germany for permanent seats on the UN
                    Security Council for some time. They've always appreciated the fact that we have
                    kept that up.</p>
                <p>You're absolutely right. We would meet and talk a lot about bilateral, economic,
                    and security issues. We also spent a lot of time, particularly Secretary
                    Christopher and Secretary of Defense Perry, on the security side. We would also
                    discuss other issues as well. On some of them the Japanese were very helpful,
                    while on others they were cautious and not helpful.</p>
                <pb facs="0722" n="Page0722"/>
                <p>On the Middle East the Japanese were helpful economically, in terms of
                    contributions. However, they were always worried about their Arab flank because
                    they obtained a lot of oil from the Middle East. We could never count on them to
                    lean on the Arabs to be reasonable. Similarly, they were more cautious about
                    Iran, Iraq, and the Gulf. Because of their dependence on oil, they wouldn't be
                    as tough. That's sort of their style, anyway.</p>
                <p>On Korea the Japanese were very helpful. They engaged in close coordination on
                    this issue with us. They understood the Four Party Talks approach [involving the
                    U.S., China, North Korea, and South Korea], without feeling that they were being
                    shut out. We were meticulous in consulting with them. I also instituted
                    trilateral consultations, between Japan, South Korea, and ourselves, at my level
                    and arranged to have them conducted at the foreign ministers' level, as well, to
                    make sure that the Japanese were comfortable with our approach. So over the last
                    couple of years, every time we met in ARF [ASEAN Regional Forum] or APEC
                    [Asia-Pacific Economic Conference], when I went on my own for some meeting, or
                    whenever the foreign ministers met, either in New York or elsewhere, we would
                    often have my level or the foreign ministers of the three countries get together
                    and make a statement, both to make Japan comfortable, but also to make clear to
                    the North Koreans that they faced a united front on our part and that they
                    couldn't divide us from South Korea or divide Japan from South Korea. The North
                    Koreans wanted to deal with us directly. This would make South Korea nervous and
                    irrelevant. We couldn't let that happen. There were a lot of reasons to do
                    that.</p>
                <p>So on Korea, Japan was helpful. The Japanese also were willing not to press ahead
                    with normalization of diplomatic relations with North Korea, which would make
                    South Korea nervous. They were willing to pace their relations with North Korea
                    to what South Korean sensitivities determined. Financially, the Japanese were
                    very helpful in supporting KEDO in an agreed framework agreeing to supply
                    billions of dollars. We had good cooperation with Japan on Korea.</p>
                <p>Similarly, on Cambodia, Mr. Akashi, a Japanese diplomat, was the lead UN official
                    there for the elections, early in my term as Assistant Secretary, not to mention
                    the fact that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs. Ogata, was also
                    Japanese. The Japanese also stationed peacekeeping troops in Cambodia, a
                    breakthrough for Japan. These Japanese troops were very carefully not provided
                    with much in the way of weapons, and they stayed out of any situation where they
                    would be likely to incur casualties. The Japanese were also helpful on Cambodia
                    economically and in diplomatic terms.</p>
                <pb facs="0723" n="Page0723"/>
                <p>On the other hand, regarding Burma, the Japanese were always concerned, as they
                    often are in their diplomacy, about economics. They were not really willing to
                    lean on the repressive Burmese Government. Japan generally provided economic
                    assistance to Burma beyond what we thought was prudent. So the Japanese weren't
                    particularly helpful on that. Certainly, on human rights they were not very
                    helpful, partly because they were concerned about contracts and economic
                    matters, as were the Europeans. The Japanese left it to us to do all of the
                    heavy lifting on human rights. Partly, they still had guilt feelings about World
                    War II, the rape of Nanking, and the occupation of China and Korea. The Germans
                    have repeatedly acknowledged their misbehavior in Europe. The Japanese haven't
                    really apologized for the rape of Nanjing and other atrocities but they are,
                    nevertheless, sensitive to it. The Japanese feel awkward about lecturing the
                    Chinese on human rights, when they behaved in such a bestial fashion during the
                    1930s and 1940s.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] Did Vietnam enter into your discussions with the Japanese?</p>
                <p>LORD: On Vietnam we kept in close touch with the Japanese. I would say that the
                    Japanese were generally quite helpful. A problem in connection with Vietnam was
                    not to have the Japanese leap too far ahead of us and sort of isolate us on the
                    Vietnam issue in multilateral institutions and bilaterally in other contexts.
                    The Japanese were out in front of us, but I would not say in an unhelpful way.
                    We really can't complain too much about what the Japanese did on Vietnam and
                    some other issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] How about Bosnia? Did they...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I would say that the Japanese were helpful in that they contributed money
                    for Bosnia programs. That's why we and the Japanese were so frustrated that it
                    took so much effort to get any money out of the Europeans on Korea and on KEDO.
                    They finally did, but I use this as an example. Japan saw security in global,
                    and not just regional terms. For example, they were willing to help out in
                    Europe. But the Europeans wouldn't really help out in Asia.</p>
                <p>May I mention Iran? There was a lot of concern over the Iran question. The
                    Japanese weren't always helpful on that issue, in particular.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] What about sanctions against Iraq? Did the
                        Japanesplay any role or did they try to stay out of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0724" n="Page0724"/>
                <p>LORD: They kept a generally low profile. I don't think that they were disruptive
                    on that. Of course, the Gulf War was before my time as Assistant Secretary.
                    During the Gulf War the Japanese gave a lot of money, but they didn't get any
                    credit for it. They didn't do it quickly enough. They didn't contribute anything
                    like minesweepers or anything else that we wanted them to do.</p>
                <p>Q: [Bernkopf] I was going to say, in just going around the circle, what about the
                    Japanese attitude on Taiwan? You referred to the defense guideline issue. To
                    what degree were there consultations on the Taiwan issue with Japan?</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, we kept in close touch with Japan on China generally, including
                    Taiwan. We never had any real disagreements. The mood in Japan in recent years
                    sort of fluctuated on China and Taiwan with public opinion. Over the last
                    several years, and particularly the last couple of years, there was a growing
                    feeling that Japanese interests lay more with the mainland of China and that
                    Japan shouldn't hamper itself by being overly solicitous about Taiwan. The
                    Japanese never wanted to dump Taiwan, but the feeling we got was that they
                    wanted to improve their relations with mainland China. However, the Chinese keep
                    bashing the Japanese on different aspects of World War II. More recently, they
                    have criticized China in connection with disputes over the control of certain
                    islands. They have also beaten up on the Japanese regarding the exchange rate of
                    the yen. These actions by China have tended to make Japan nervous. Whenever
                    there is a U.S.-China summit meeting, the Japanese have been a little concerned
                    as well.</p>
                <p>For all of these reasons I think that, consequently, there has been some recent
                    concern among the Japanese about Taiwan. I don't want to exaggerate this and I'm
                    just talking about an amorphous mood. However, I felt that in the course of my
                    four years as Assistant Secretary that the Japanese romance with China began to
                    sour a little bit. The Japanese still knew that they had to and wanted to deal
                    with China, but they began to see that China is going to be a real rival in the
                    region. The Japanese are getting a little annoyed at the Chinese sticking it to
                    them all the time when they meet with the United States. The Chinese seem to
                    want to make the Japanese feel guilty. As I said, there are still some
                    territorial disputes in the Yellow Sea, or other areas. Japanese-Chinese
                    relations have always been a love-hate relationship.</p>
                <p>On Taiwan there has always been a suspicion in China about Japanese motives,
                    because of the history of Japanese involvement in Taiwan. Regarding Taiwan the
                    only two countries that the Chinese really care about are the views of the
                    United States and the relations between Taiwan and Japan. The Chinese leaders
                    generally look the other way when Taiwanese leaders visit Southeast Asia,
                    whether for official visits or golf games. However, the Chinese go crazy when
                    President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan goes to Cornell University, either unofficially
                    or to get an honorary degree. Also, President Lee Teng-hui attended a Japanese
                    university. So the Chinese complain loudly to us and Japan about high-level
                    dealings with Taiwan, but tend to overlook other countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0725" n="Page0725"/>
                <p>I don't know of any U.S.-Japan disagreements on Taiwan. During the Taiwan missile
                    crisis, the Japanese welcomed our sending aircraft carriers to the region. They
                    would not have admitted this in public, but then they never do.</p>
                <p>Prime Minister Hashimoto and other Japanese officials were very good on the
                    defense guidelines. One of their cabinet spokesmen got out of line, in effect,
                    when he said that the defense guidelines applied to Taiwan. I think that he was
                    fired for that remark. Then, somebody else tried to pull back and said that the
                    defense guidelines didn't apply to Taiwan. I think that was Koichi Kato. Prime
                    Minister Hashimoto reaffirmed the U.S.-Japan security treaty during the
                    President's trip to Japan. Just as we reassure Japan when a senior American
                    official goes to China, without being defensive, we also don't want to be
                    provocative with Japan when we're dealing with China, although I would rather
                    lean toward Japan if we have to choose.</p>
                <p>So before President Clinton's trip to Japan and during the process of reviewing
                    U.S.-Japanese defense arrangements, we kept the Chinese posted. We briefed the
                    Chinese fully just before the announcements in Japan and on the public
                    statements made during the trip by the Japanese Prime Minister and the
                    President, specifically on the defense guidelines. We made clear that our
                    defense treaty was not directed at China and that we wanted constructive
                    relations with China. We talked to the Chinese privately as well.</p>
                <p>We found ways to remind them, however, that firing missiles in the Taiwan Straits
                    and being belligerent might well contribute to a tightening of the relationship
                    between the U.S. and Japan. We said that it wasn't in China's interest to be
                    provocative. However, that was done with some subtlety.</p>
                <p>So, in answer to your question I don't remember any serioudisagreements between
                    the U.S. and Japan on Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Bernkopf] Were the Japanese at all reluctant to discuss
                        Taiwaand future problems, in the event of a conflict?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: The Japanese certainly made no public statement or let any comment on this
                    subject leak out, although they were more relaxed in talking about Korea than
                    they were about Taiwan. I wasn't in on all of the detailed discussions on
                    contingency planning, and I can't say just how precise we were on this. However,
                    the U.S. and Japan continue to maintain that the defense guidelines apply to
                    situations and not places. Nevertheless, it's clear, and this is a strictly
                    hypothetical comment, that if China launched an obvious act of aggression
                    against Taiwan, and Japan wouldn't let us use our bases in Japan or help us out,
                    a lot of Americans would wonder what the U.S.-Japanese alliance was all about. I
                    think that the Japanese understand that. However, everyone hopes that we never
                    get to that point.</p>
                <pb facs="0726" n="Page0726"/>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] When we talk about a defensive alliance, we should note that things
                    have changed. You have to be defensive against something. How would we deal with
                    a putative Chinese attack on Taiwan and what have we been thinking about that?
                    Taiwan is obviously something.</p>
                <p>LORD: Obviously, the easiest thing to point to, and the least controversial
                    aspect is Korea. We had no objection to saying, either publicly and privately,
                    that we were going to work out with the Japanese how we can coordinate better in
                    the event of a crisis on the Korean Peninsula. In such a situation Japan would
                    be absolutely crucial as a staging base. We would want to be sure that we could
                    use all of Japan's bases and we would want to be sure that they would back us up
                    with refueling, minesweeping, and so on. So that's an easy contingency to
                    discuss. That's the one that we point to.</p>
                <p>Beyond that, what we've been stressing generally is the importance of this treaty
                    for regional stability and reassuring people with our presence, with the added
                    virtue of having troops in the area. Beyond Korea we are not specific in using
                    examples in public. The treaty is there and it's meant to be a deterrent. I
                    don't even know, myself, in the years since I left the Department of State, how
                    much private precision we have on the Taiwan situation, on a contingency basis.
                    We do have quite a bit of precision on South Korea. It's hard to be specific and
                    quantify, but there is no question that our defense relationship with Japan does
                    provide a sense of stability in the region. The U.S.-Japan relationship and our
                    troop presence generally in Asia are going to be under review if not challenge
                    if we ever get a settlement in Korea. Don't hold your breath until this is
                    accomplished. However, if the Korean situation is resolved and the country is
                    unified, or at least peace returns to the Korean Peninsula, then people are
                    going to wonder why we have all of these U.S. forces in Asia.</p>
                <p>We'll get to Korea in just a minute. That's the next subject. However, the fact
                    is that the Koreans themselves, and I've heard President Kim Dae Jung say this
                    in so many words, want us to stay on in South Korea even if North and South
                    Korea are reunified. He said that he would say this to his North Korean partner
                    if the country is ever reunified, and we'll get back to that. If we take our
                    troops out of South Korea and they're only in Japan, that will put all the more
                    domestic, political pressures on Japan to ask the U.S. to withdraw our forces
                    from Japan as well. So we have to stress, and we believe this, that the presence
                    of U.S. forces in the area, including Korea, provides regional stability.</p>
                <p>In fact, if the threat to our forces and to South Korea all but disappears, then
                    we probably should reduce or redeploy at least our ground forces. But our air
                    and naval forces generally and troops remaining in Japan and to some extent in
                    South Korea would still be relevant. We don't want Japan to be the only place in
                    the Pacific where we have troops, besides Hawaii and Guam. Have I answered your
                    question?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0727" n="Page0727"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Our posture should be one of being ready to cooperate in crises unforseen.
                    This is not automatic, but the point is that the ways are greased to make it
                    possible to move much more automatically and quickly in a cooperative way, with
                    Japan's support, on any crisis in the area. So a crisis could be over islands
                    out in the Pacific Ocean which are disputed by various countries. Another
                    hypothetical crisis could involve Taiwan. Still another possibility could
                    involve Korea. Among other things, we're talking about sea lanes and commercial
                    lanes of communications which are used by the great bulk of the trade of Japan
                    and other countries. These sea lanes of communications could be used for the
                    movement of energy resources from the Middle East. We're talking about strategic
                    locations. So our purpose is to be ready. The fact is that, right now, people
                    cannot envisage specific conflicts that are likely to emerge beyond the case of
                    Korea, which is a specific commitment, and Taiwan, where we are deliberately
                    ambiguous. I think that people would say that those are the two points of the
                    greatest, potential danger in East Asia right now.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] You served as Ambassador to China, and you saw, I don't know how
                    many, but in any case a lot of Chinese going to the United States to study. I
                    mean, they were studying subjects at important levels. They were coming back to
                    China. Obviously, this present generation of Chinese includes a lot of people
                    who have a real understanding of the United States. They will be moving into
                    important positions in their families and elsewhere. What about Japan? Was there
                    much intermingling between official Americans in Tokyo and Japanese who were
                    going to the United States for graduate studies?</p>
                <p>LORD: Quite a few Japanese have come to the United States for study and other
                    purposes. They have not come in as large numbers as the Chinese and people from
                    Taiwan, Malaysia, and so on. The real problem is that there are very few
                    Americans going to Japan to study over there, probably for language reasons. One
                    of the goals of Ambassador Mondale was to increase the number of Americans going
                    to Japan, both to increase understanding between our two countries and to
                    develop a cadre of Americans who, in the future, would understand Japan better
                    and how to deal with it.</p>
                <pb facs="0728" n="Page0728"/>
                <p>I don't have a good sense of the number of Japanese coming to study in the U.S.,
                    but there are quite a few, and the number is significant. Certainly, as the
                    younger generation of Japanese grows up, you can see this trend, when you deal
                    with ordinary people and even if you meet people at the Vice Ministerial level -
                    the younger generation of Japanese speaks English much better, is more outspoken
                    and more candid with you, and is more willing to speak up at multilateral
                    conferences, and even disagree among themselves. This tendency has been partly
                    nurtured by an organization of which I was a member, The Trilateral Commission,
                    which was set up in the early 1970s. Among other reasons, it was established to
                    encourage the Japanese to understand their global and regional responsibilities
                    and to become more outspoken. That has encouraged the process, as has the
                    general maturing of Japan itself.</p>
                <p>This question of cultural and educational exchange is important. This may sound
                    like a bromide, but I do believe that it has a lot to do with improving
                    relations. I was a member of the U.S.-Japan Foundation, one of the
                    non-governmental hats I wore before I went to work for the U.S. Government. We
                    were promoting this. I think that there are enough Japanese coming in this
                    direction, but there aren't enough Americans going in the other direction.XXV.
                    STATE DEPARTMENT ASSISTANT SECRETARY - KOREA (1993-1997)</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] Let's turn now to Korea, North and South. You mentioned that you had
                    gotten involved in the nuclear issue, but maybe, initially, we should talk more
                    about how you saw both of these countries at the time you became Assistant
                    Secretary and how things the situation later evolved.</p>
                <p>LORD: I listed Korea after Japan in the 10 goals I mentioned in my statement at
                    the confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate, when I was appointed Assistant
                    Secretary. This was not a strict, rank ordering, but Korea was one of the early
                    goals I mentioned because it was the most urgent security problem facing us,
                    certainly in East Asia, and probably in the world. Various aspects of Korean
                    affairs were to occupy a great deal of my time, correctly in my view, during the
                    four years I served as Assistant Secretary. Probably, Korean affairs tied with
                    Japan in first place for my attention, although China was very important as
                    well. However, Korea was very important throughout this period. I guess that
                    Japan, Korea, and China are and were the highest priorities in terms of
                    significance to the U.S. in East Asia.</p>
                <p>Korean affairs also involve the most difficult issues facing the United States,
                    and not only in terms of the security challenge. North Korea is one of the most
                    opaque and difficult regimes I have dealt with in my political career, and I've
                    seen some pretty nasty and mysterious governments. Our intelligence on North
                    Korea is very poor. I'm not blaming the intelligence community for that. We just
                    don't know what the hell is going on there. So that's one part of the
                    problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0729" n="Page0729"/>
                <p>Then South Korea is very sensitive to any dealings we may have with North Korea.
                    You always have to be very careful not to hurt that relationship. I feel very
                    strongly about that principle. Furthermore, it is not only us who don't
                    understand what's going on in North Korea. The Japanese, the Chinese, the
                    Russians, and the South Koreans don't really know much about North Korea,
                    either. North Korea is not only a very unpleasant regime. North Korea is almost
                    totally opaque, and that made it difficult to deal with them.</p>
                <p>Korea is obviously important to the U.S. because we have about 37,000 troops in
                    Korea South of the DMZ [Demilitarized Zone]. We would certainly win any
                    conventional war with North Korea, but there would be tremendous casualties on
                    the U.S. side and particularly among the South Koreans and their people. The DMZ
                    is only 20 or 30 miles North of Seoul. The North Koreans have a very large
                    number of artillery pieces lined up North of the 38th parallel, and God knows
                    what they've hidden in underground caves. They can wreak a lot of damage before
                    we can put the genie back in the bottle. Then, on top of that, there is the
                    potential nuclear threat coming out of North Korea, and I'll get to that in a
                    minute.</p>
                <p>Then there is the fact that we once fought a war there against North Korea and
                    with China, so there's an important, Chinese dimension, including their
                    influence. There are crucial security, historical, cultural, and even economic
                    reasons for Japan to be interested in Korea. Russia is clearly interested in
                    Korea. So, for all of these reasons, North Korea presented extremely important
                    and complex issues to the United States.</p>
                <p>Throughout my four years as Assistant Secretary my personal principle was that
                    our relationship with South Korea, however difficult at times, always had to
                    come first. It is true that there were some people in my bureau, able and good
                    people, who would get sufficiently annoyed with the South Korean regime in
                    Seoul, or sufficiently worried about the nuclear crisis, or who advocated
                    tactics that would be more efficient, if we leaned a little bit more toward
                    North Korea. I wouldn't give South Korea a veto over our policy, but within the
                    State Department I was probably the one most solicitous of South Korean
                    sensitivities. I don't say this in criticism of others. I think that we could
                    disagree about how much the South Koreans were holding us back and endangering
                    our security interests at times by being overly sensitive. During the early
                    1990s, the Seoul government, under Kim Young Sam, was somewhat “hawkish.” It
                    became more “dovish” under Kim Dae Jung after I left. I always felt that we had
                    to be rock solid with the South Koreans, as a matter of principle and because of
                    how we need to treat our allies. The South Koreans were the closest to North
                    Korea and were the most threatened by the North Korean regime. It is their
                    peninsula after all. For domestic political and Congressional reasons, our ties
                    to our allies, and our democratic allies at that, versus this nasty regime in
                    North Korea - these were other reasons to be close to South Korea. I spent a
                    great deal of time on South Korea both in consultations and trips there. I think
                    that my major contribution throughout this period was holding the South Koreans'
                    hands and working hard on that aspect of our relations, even as I
                    enthusiastically supported the agreed framework and our efforts to try to open
                    up North Korea. This was in our own self interest.</p>
                <pb facs="0730" n="Page0730"/>
                <p>I understood that South Korea could be unreasonable and that we had our own
                    interests to defend. I felt that we shouldn't let South Korean sensitivities
                    endanger our other security interests. But I understood the South Korean point
                    of view, and my basic impulse was to stick with South Korea.</p>
                <p>So in view of this principle of working with the South Koreans, I applied it
                    during many trips of my own to South Korea, as well as in dealing constantly
                    with the South Korean Ambassador in Washington. I did this by pushing for as
                    many meetings as possible between the foreign ministers, not to mention the
                    Presidents. I instituted trilateral consultations between the Japanese, the
                    South Koreans, and myself, at my level and at the foreign minister level. I went
                    with the President to South Korea. I also traveled there with Secretary of State
                    Christopher and with the U.S. Secretary of Defense, etc.</p>
                <p>Above all, I pushed for North-South dialogues. I sought to deflect the North
                    Korean decades-long objective of dealing directly with us over the heads of the
                    South Koreans. The North Koreans were trying to make the South Koreans nervous
                    and irrelevant. Now that brings us to the nuclear question, which, of course,
                    was the major issue, although we can get into some other issues as well. There's
                    been some criticism of the 1994 Agreement which was finally worked out with the
                    North Koreans, including criticism by figures from the Bush administration. I
                    think that it is reasonable for us to have disagreements, but the fact is, and
                    I'm not a partisan in this respect, that we had a festering nuclear problem
                    which the Bush administration hadn't done a hell of a lot about by the time
                    President Clinton came into office. So for these Bush administration figures to
                    turn around and be critical of the nuclear agreement reached by the Clinton
                    administration is misguided.</p>
                <p>Not everyone from the Bush administration was equally guilty in this respect. To
                    his credit Ambassador Don Gregg has been superb on this issue and has been very
                    supportive. Others have been less supportive. Some have been harshly
                    critical.</p>
                <p>The other problem that I have with the critics is their view of the nuclear
                    agreement. Although this agreement is not perfect, no one has come up with a
                    better solution. I'll go into this in more detail, but the choice we faced was
                    either the agreement we reached with North Korea or a real possibility of war
                    with a North Korea which had a significant military threat. Essentially what we
                    did was to reach an admittedly imperfect agreement aimed at closing off the
                    North Korean nuclear capability over time. This was in exchange for economic
                    help to North Korea to replace the energy they wouldn't have, with an ability to
                    call off all bets if the North Koreans started violating the nuclear
                    agreement.</p>
                <pb facs="0731" n="Page0731"/>
                <p>When the Clinton administration entered office, the problem was that the North
                    Koreans, who had signed the NPT [Non Proliferation Treaty], I believe, in the
                    1980s, were obligated to undergo inspections of their nuclear facilities by the
                    International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. During the early months of the
                    Clinton administration the North Koreans were dragging their feet on this issue
                    and, particularly, on a plutonium producing complex in Yongbon.There were
                    negotiations and pressures, as well as attempts through the UN, the IAEA, and in
                    cooperation with the Chinese and others, to try to get the North Koreans to do
                    what they were obligated to do under the NPT. We got to the point where a crisis
                    was precipitated by a North Korean threat to withdraw from the NPT. This would
                    have been bad for the treaty in general. However, and more specifically, this
                    would have meant that the North Koreans were hell bent on developing a nuclear
                    capability.</p>
                <p>So we began an intensive process of negotiations, and here we get to the point
                    which involved Bob Gallucci. Let me say that he did a superb job in very
                    difficult negotiations. At the time and since then some people wondered why Win
                    Lord didn't handle this job or why he didn't seem to have a problem with
                    Gallucci doing the job. First of all, I can't tell you whether, if I had wanted
                    this job, I would have been chosen to handle it. It required tremendous
                    expertise on nuclear non proliferation issues which Bob had. I knew much more
                    than Bob did about Asia. However, it was never a contest because I didn't want
                    to do this job.</p>
                <p>This was absolutely true for two reasons. First, I felt comfortable with this
                    arrangement, with the U.S. taking the lead with North Korea on this nuclear
                    question. Like it or not, we had to take the lead, and not South Korea. This is
                    a global problem, involving nuclear weapons and non proliferation. It has
                    implications around the world and not just for the Korean Peninsula. Therefore,
                    the symbolism of a non-Asian person being in the lead made sense to me, not to
                    mention some of Bob Gallucci's great experience in nuclear proliferation and
                    technical matters. I had done a lot of work on proliferation but I wasn't even
                    close to his expertise, even though I knew more about Asia than he did. So I
                    felt that, symbolically, this made sense.</p>
                <p>More significantly, in my own judgment, I knew that handling these negotiations
                    with North Korea was a full-time job. In terms of prestige and profile, I know
                    you are better off taking one big job and pulling it off, whether this involves
                    someone like Bob on Korea or Dick Holbrooke on Bosnia. That's the way to give
                    yourself a high profile. This was earned by both gentlemen, I might add.
                    However, I was concerned about our Asian policy in general. There was no way to
                    do the Korean negotiations without spending somewhere between 75 and 99 percent
                    of my time on it. The job involved running around, negotiating with the North
                    Koreans and talking to the South Koreans, Russians, Japanese, and Chinese, plus
                    dealing with members of Congress and the press. It was a full time or at least
                    three quarters time job.</p>
                <pb facs="0732" n="Page0732"/>
                <p>In my job as Assistant Secretary I was concerned about China, Japan, Southeast
                    Asia, the Pacific Community, and all of the other issues, including Vietnam, the
                    ASEAN Regional Forum, and APEC. To give all of that up and leave it to my
                    deputies just didn't make sense. I mention that because some people say: “Well,
                    Lord turned over Korea to Gallucci and so on.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] Could you give us a quick background note on
                        Gallucci?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: For a detailed background, we'd have to look it up. I know that he had
                    served in Politico-Military affairs and had handled some specific non
                    proliferation negotiations.</p>
                <p>Q: [Bernkopf] He was out in the parking lot in Iraq, in the early days after the
                    Gulf War, trying to get inspections done. The Iraqis were stonewalling us. So
                    he'd been involved in the same kind of situation.</p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, and his general background was arms control and non proliferation. He
                    was the head of the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and a very smart guy.
                    He turned out to be a terrific negotiator. I might add, to the disappointment of
                    our listeners who prefer controversy, that he and I couldn't have worked more
                    closely together than we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Bernkopf] I wanted to ask you that. How did you find
                        workinwith a specialist of this kind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: This was an ideal setup. It's another reason that I didn't want to do this
                    job. I wanted to do all of these other things. It wasn't as if I was being cut
                    out. I obviously wasn't going to have the profile. He had elevated rank, which
                    meant that he could report to the NSC [National Security Council] and to the
                    White House directly with Secretary Christopher and everyone else sitting there.
                    This was the way it worked in practice and the way I knew it would work, because
                    we had good relations and we also worked in close coordination. So the first
                    thing I did was to make sure that Gallucci's deputy was also my deputy. That is,
                    Tom Hubbard. We also had a very strong desk and gave a lot of support to him. It
                    was a real intermingling of the Bureau of East Asian Affairs and the Bureau of
                    Politico-Military Affairs. Gallucci knew that he needed help on the Asian front,
                    even though he knew non proliferation issues, particularly regarding Korea.</p>
                <pb facs="0733" n="Page0733"/>
                <p>We kept in the closest touch. We did that also with the Defense Department, as
                    you have to, and with the intelligence agencies. There were seldom any major
                    disagreements on ideas. He negotiated, sometimes being a little bit more
                    flexible toward the North Koreans, while I, with my South Korean loyalties,
                    would at times be a little bit more restrained. This was never a major issue.
                    Gallucci deserved all of the credit that he got, and he did a fabulous job. He
                    would be the first to say Tom Hubbard was essential to what he did and that we
                    worked as two bureaus in a beautiful fashion. So it really was an achievement.
                    Sometimes this kind of arrangement doesn't work. However, it is a good example
                    of a regional bureau and a functional bureau in the State Department, working
                    together hand in glove. People in the delegation would go to negotiate and then
                    meet back in Washington. They would get as much, if not more, from my bureau
                    than from his own bureau.</p>
                <p>It was a terrifically integrated affair. I felt that I had full input into policy
                    recommendations and decisions. I spent quite a bit of time on it but I was able
                    to do everything else that I wanted to do.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] You say that there was criticism that we should have done this or
                    that. Did you find that you were involved in more or less fending off criticism
                    while Gallucci went on with his work? Were there a lot of quarterbacks in the
                    press?</p>
                <p>LORD: Do you mean on the ultimate agreement or on my role?</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] Not on your role as such. I'm really talking about your role in
                    dealing with the problem of all of these other quarterbacks who were trying to
                    say that we should do this or should do that.</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, Gallucci had to deal with that problem front and centeas well.</p>
                <p>What I will do now, without going into any great detail that is well known, is to
                    say that since we are talking about Korea, the first major event was President
                    Bush's trip to South Korea in July, 1993, after he went to Japan. He visited the
                    DMZ to underline our solidarity with South Korea. He gave a major, security
                    speech in Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] Who was the President of South Korea at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Kim Yong Sam, a former dissident, came in as President abouthe same
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] How long...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0734" n="Page0734"/>
                <p>LORD: They never really hit it off very well. Kim Yong Sam, in all fairness, was
                    a little flaky and volatile, reading the editorials in the press from day to day
                    and often adjusting his policies in accordance with them. He was very suspicious
                    of the U.S. Understandably, he was also suspicious of North Korea. He was
                    frustrated, as many Koreans were, that they were not in the lead on negotiations
                    with the North Koreans. We kept pressing very hard for North-South talks as well
                    but we thought that we had to take the lead on the nuclear question because we
                    were a nuclear power and had leverage with North Korea that South Korea didn't
                    have. We went out of our way to keep the South Koreans posted and to consult
                    with them throughout. They were on the scene, and we would talk to them after
                    the meetings. We talked to them in Washington and in Seoul.</p>
                <p>There was less than full camaraderie in the President's meetings, although the
                    atmosphere wasn't unfriendly. It was just that Kim Yong Sam was frankly not
                    particularly impressive, unlike his predecessor. He had been a dissident. I had
                    first met him when I was in Seoul for the Olympic Games in 1988. We had
                    breakfast together. I can't remember what the issue was but first we said that
                    we would keep our conversation essentially off the record, and not debrief the
                    press afterwards. Then Kim Yong Sam turned my position upside down with the
                    press, so I never had a particularly positive view of him.</p>
                <p>On the whole, Kim Yong Sam was cordial to me, and I used to see him occasionally
                    on my own. I attended a lot of meetings with the Foreign and Defense Ministers
                    and the President. However, I would have to say that Kim Yong Sam was not one of
                    the more impressive leaders that we had to deal with. This didn't help our
                    diplomacy during this period because he was unpredictable. He would often sway
                    back and forth, depending on public opinion. As I said, he was particularly
                    suspicious of our dealings with the North Koreans, even though we went out of
                    our way to keep him informed. I spent a lot of time personally in consulting
                    with him and his colleagues and reassuring them.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] Did you find that you could deal with a corps of professional
                    Ministry of Foreign Affairs people in Seoul whom you could include on the team
                    there?</p>
                <p>LORD: Kim Yong Sam had a very secretive way of operating. He would play his
                    advisers off against each other. For example, he would play the Blue House,
                    which is the equivalent of our White House, against the South Korean Foreign
                    Ministry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] Sounds like Kissinger...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0735" n="Page0735"/>
                <p>LORD: I was, of course, shocked at all of this. The most helpful person was the
                    first Foreign Minister we dealt with while I was there, a man named Han
                    Sung-Joo. He had come out of academia. I had known him for a long time. He had
                    been my host when I was at a conference at a think tank in the late 1970s. He
                    was highly respected. He had never previously served in the South Korean
                    Government.</p>
                <p>He turned out to be quite courageous in supporting our efforts with North Korea.
                    He obviously represented South Korean interests and views very strongly but he
                    was always trying to get the South Korean President and the Blue House to be
                    reasonable with regard to our dealings with North Korea and on the agreement. He
                    paid a price for it, essentially by helping us to get the agreement completed,
                    despite some South Korean concerns. I think that some people in the Blue House
                    developed some animus against him, and he was eased out as Foreign Minister at a
                    certain point.</p>
                <p>His successor as Foreign Minister was also very helpful. He was Ro Myung Gong,
                    who had been South Korean Ambassador to Tokyo. He was a career diplomat and also
                    was a very constructive force. He worked with us. He was eased out later on. His
                    place as Foreign Minister was finally taken by the former South Korean National
                    Security Adviser. So we essentially had him to deal with.</p>
                <p>During this time we were blessed with a superb Ambassador in South Korea, Jim
                    Laney, who had taught in Korea and spoke Korean. He had previously been in South
                    Korea in the 1970s, I believe. Again, he was a good example, as Ambassador
                    Mondale had been, of the opposite of suffering from clientitis. He would present
                    the South Korean perspective. But he would carry difficult messages and would
                    press the South Koreans to be reasonable. He was an extremely able and good
                    person to work with. We were blessed with a strong American Embassy in Seoul.
                    Ambassador Laney's Deputy Chief of Mission, Chuck Kartman, is now a Special
                    Ambassador for negotiations on the nuclear issue. He was confirmed by the Senate
                    last week. We had a strong team in the Embassy, working with Hubbard, in
                    addition to Gallucci. Other people in Gallucci's office were very good. They
                    were supported by a strong desk in Washington.</p>
                <p>On the South Korean side we had very little to deal with. We had a volatile top
                    guy and an able, constructive Foreign Minister who didn't have all that much
                    power. So it was not easy.</p>
                <p>Q: [Kennedy] We're talking now about an opaque system, which allows editors and
                    commentators to have a wonderful time because they can make up anything that
                    they want. Had Kim Il Sung [long time leader of North Korea] died at this
                    point?</p>
                <pb facs="0736" n="Page0736"/>
                <p>LORD: Well, before answering that question I would like to get back a little bit
                    to the narrative. In the midst of the difficulties that we were having with the
                    North Koreans, and I don't recall the exact dates, as 1993 wore on, and then in
                    1994, we got to the point where the North Koreans were on the verge of pulling
                    out of the NPT [Non Proliferation Treaty]. So we went to the UN and pressed for
                    sanctions against North Korea. The situation was getting quite tense. Of course,
                    we had to bring along the Japanese, who were a little bit nervous but were
                    generally supportive. The South Koreans, of course, were happy to work with us.
                    The Chinese were dragging their feet, as were the Russians. However, we managed
                    to get a UNSC President's statement even though we didn't get a Security Council
                    resolution. We were moving toward sanctions because the North Koreans were
                    flouting the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspections.</p>
                <p>I don't recall the exact language they used, but the North Koreans threatened
                    that sanctions could or would lead to war. So people have to remember that this
                    was a very dangerous situation. We couldn't ignore the budding nuclear threat,
                    and we didn't wish to risk a bloody war. We negotiated a less than perfect
                    agreement but a very good one, in my view. Also, we were willing to flex our
                    muscles. This was a classic lesson in diplomacy. You have to have sticks and
                    carrots to use. The stick was that we were prepared to go for sanctions, and we
                    worked hard on that at the UN. This was a very tense time, and people tend to
                    forget this.</p>
                <p>During this time we also reinforced our forces in South Korea to strengthen our
                    diplomatic hand and to be ready for conflict. We sent Patriot anti-missile
                    weapons. We sent Apache helicopters. And, in the middle of an NSC [National
                    Security Council] meeting, at which I was not present, there was talk of further
                    force deployments. There were options being considered of major reinforcements,
                    moderate reinforcements, and token reinforcements. The President was close to
                    deciding even at that meeting to have another, major buildup of our forces. Then
                    a message came from former President Carter, who was visiting North Korea, of a
                    possible breakthrough with Kim Il Sung, the North Korean leader.</p>
                <p>Let me just back off a bit and refer to former President Carter. There was a lot
                    of ambivalence about his role. Obviously, there was general respect for him as a
                    former President, as someone who had been a capable ex-President interested in
                    humanitarian causes. He conducted himself very well in the service of world
                    peace and alleviating disease and hunger. Of course, he was a Democrat.
                    President Clinton was also a Democrat, and you had to pay attention to that,
                    although the two of them had never been close. Secretary Christopher had worked
                    for President Carter as Deputy Secretary of State and knew him well. However,
                    President Carter also had a tremendous ego. He didn't mind getting the Nobel
                    Peace Prize. On occasion, despite a strong reputation on human rights, he has
                    shown an amazing ability to tolerate really ugly world leaders. He has been on
                    occasion a kind of unguided missile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] When was this? You have to get the feel for the
                        man.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0737" n="Page0737"/>
                <p>LORD: Carter had some ego, and former Presidents tend to have some ego. In any
                    event, President Clinton couldn't say “No” when former President Carter said
                    that he would like to go to North Korea. Nor could Secretary Christopher.
                    However, everyone was a little bit nervous. As you know, this was a tense time.
                    We weren't quite sure how rock solid former President Carter would be with the
                    North Koreans or whether he would undercut our position. So Gallucci and I, in
                    addition to others, including my deputies and so on, brought former President
                    Carter up to speed as best we could before he went out to North Korea.</p>
                <p>It is only fair here to say that former President Carter played a major and
                    significant role at this time. We were at this very tense moment of possible
                    major redeployments of U.S. forces. We were already strengthening our forces in
                    South Korea and moving at the UN. The North Koreans were using very bellicose
                    language. At that point, a telephone call came through from former President
                    Carter that he had seen Kim Il Sung [long time leader of North Korea]. I don't
                    have the exact language that Carter used, but the report was that the North
                    Koreans were willing to freeze what they were doing on the nuclear front in
                    exchange for negotiations. The North Koreans had been doing several things in
                    the nuclear area. Now, of course, they wanted to negotiate only with us and thus
                    make the South Koreans nervous. However, for the reasons I mentioned, we were in
                    close consultations with the South Koreans, and that's the way we had to proceed
                    anyway.</p>
                <p>This North Korean offer did put a hold on North Korean nuclear development. At
                    some point, and it may have been at this same meeting, he persuaded Kim Il Sung
                    to agree to meet face to face with President Kim Yong Sam of South Korea.
                    However, then Kim Il Sung died before he actually met with him.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, this offer was important because it gave us an opening for the
                    negotiations. It stopped the momentum of the North Korean nuclear program, which
                    meant that it lessened the tensions that had built up by this time and opened up
                    the possibility of negotiations. It meant that the Great Leader [name generally
                    used to refer to Kim Il Sung in North Korea], who had all of this prestige in
                    North Korea, whether it was deserved or not, had put his stamp on at least
                    talking about this issue and being at least willing to bargain away their
                    nuclear program. Any successor to Kim Il Sung who took over in North Korea,
                    particularly Kim Il Sung's son, Kim Jong Il, could negotiate on this issue
                    because he had the cover that this process was started by Kim Il Sung. Kim Jong
                    Il couldn't have started this by himself.</p>
                <p>So former President Carter made an historic contribution, for all of the concerns
                    and nervousness we had in connection with his travels. One of my officers
                    traveled with him on each of his trips in East Asia. Dick Christianson had
                    actually been the DCM [Deputy Chief of Mission] for some time.</p>
                <pb facs="0738" n="Page0738"/>
                <p>Then the negotiations with the North Koreans started. Again, I don't have the
                    exact date. The basic agreement was reached in October, 1994. Without trying to
                    be precise on the details, the agreement contained the following main points.
                    The North Koreans would stop the operation of the small reactor that they had
                    had for some time. They not only would not have any activity at this site, they
                    would not continue to build two larger reactors. They would dismantle them over
                    time. The North Koreans would agree to store the reprocessed nuclear fuel that
                    they already had and which was possibly of weapons grade; they would agree to
                    store and not use this reprocessed fuel and hopefully ship it out of the
                    country. They would agree to real IAEA inspections. They would remain within the
                    NPT system. So, in effect, they were saying that they would freeze their nuclear
                    program and ultimately dismantle it, in exchange for certain things, which I
                    will get to in a minute.</p>
                <p>The fact is that, at this point, we thought that the North Koreans had enough
                    plutonium for one or possibly two nuclear devices. This doesn't mean that they
                    had already produced the devices, but there was enough plutonium not accounted
                    for to make one or two bombs. This was what the big crisis over IAEA inspections
                    was about. That is, their accounting for their plutonium. However, I have seen
                    estimates that, with their facilities, they were on the verge of being able to
                    produce anywhere from six to 10 nuclear weapons a year in the following years.
                    So we faced the prospect of tens or dozens of nuclear weapons at some point over
                    the coming years.</p>
                <p>One choice was to acquiesce in that - this was an unacceptable danger to the
                    Korean Peninsula, to South Korean and American lives, and to the global, non
                    proliferation system. The other choices were to probably go to war or make an
                    agreement with North Korea. Sanctions, by themselves, clearly weren't going to
                    stop the North Koreans from pursuing their nuclear program. We put sanctions on
                    and created pressure so we could remove those sanctions in exchange for genuine
                    negotiations. I am referring to temporary sanctions and not the long-standing,
                    bilateral sanctions such as on terrorism. It was clear that North Korea was an
                    economic basket case. However, it was sufficiently non-reliant on outside help
                    that international sanctions, even if enforced across the board, were not going
                    to make them change their nuclear program, even if they had to suffer
                    economically. We were not at all confident about full Chinese compliance in any
                    event.</p>
                <pb facs="0739" n="Page0739"/>
                <p>So we didn't have the option of stopping the North Korean nuclear program
                    strictly by economic means. This left the option of stopping their nuclear
                    program by military means. Now, we bandied about a surgical strike on their
                    nuclear capabilities. We looked at these things carefully. First, we weren't
                    sure that we could hit the North Korean nuclear facilities. We didn't know
                    whether the North Koreans had some underground facilities or what we could hit.
                    Secondly, we couldn't be sure that there wouldn't be radioactive fallout from
                    the facilities that we did hit. In the relatively small Korean Peninsula we
                    might wind up hitting ourselves and our own troops, as well as the South Koreans
                    and the North Koreans. Depending on the way that the winds blow, there was a
                    danger that the nuclear fallout from nuclear strikes would hit Japan. Finally,
                    of course, whatever our superiority, if we attacked North Korea's nuclear sites,
                    we thought that the odds were extremely high that the North Koreans would launch
                    an attack on South Korea, with all of the consequent devastation in Seoul and
                    elsewhere. So, serious as this was, we didn't think that “surgical strikes” was
                    an attractive option either.</p>
                <p>I'm not trying to set up a straw man. They really were terrible choices which
                    people now forget, when they criticize the agreement reached.</p>
                <p>In addition to freezing and eventually dismantling the North Korean nuclear
                    program and their staying in the NPT, North Korea also agreed to IAEA
                    inspections, but we didn't get everything that we wanted. The only important
                    thing that we didn't get was an immediate accounting for the plutonium in North
                    Korea which had set off the crisis in the first place. At the most, this
                    material would have been enough for one and possibly two bombs. But the North
                    Koreans were committed to account for their plutonium over a projected period of
                    five years, at a particular stage when we would provide critical help with the
                    “safer” nuclear reactors we were to build. The North Koreans accepted the
                    obligation to allow the inspections before they got the essential components for
                    the two nuclear light water reactors, which we promised to provide them. So they
                    wouldn't get what they needed before they fessed up. However, they didn't have
                    to fess up for about five years.</p>
                <p>A lot of people criticize this fact. They said that we were prepared to let the
                    North Koreans continue to hide this plutonium for several more years. It's true
                    that we would have preferred to get an immediate and full accounting for this
                    plutonium. Thus, in exchange for freezing and dismantling their nuclear program,
                    there was the danger that they might have enough plutonium for one or two bombs,
                    which they couldn't do anything with anyway. We felt that this risk was worth it
                    in order to freeze the rest of the North Korean nuclear program, have them
                    dismantle these facilities, and get this accounting for the plutonium in a few
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] Was this five year moratorium basically a matter
                        of face?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0740" n="Page0740"/>
                <p>LORD: No. The North Koreans obviously wanted to delay dismantling their
                    facilities as long as they could. One can be suspicious of them, and with good
                    reason. It wasn't literally a delay of five years. Dismantling these facilities
                    was required at a stage when we were prepared to give them major components for
                    building light water reactors. They would have to dismantle these existing
                    facilities and account for their plutonium.</p>
                <p>Together with South Korea and Japan, we agreed on a couple of other things to
                    make it worthwhile for North Korea. When you make a deal, you have to make
                    concessions. First, working with others, we would provide two light water
                    reactors to replace the kind of graphite moderated reactors, whatever the kind
                    they had, which are more dangerous for proliferation. The North Koreans were
                    going to dismantle these. The light water reactors were intended for energy
                    generating purposes to replace the energy they were giving up through
                    dismantlement.</p>
                <p>This reactor building program involved a roughly $7.0 billion commitment spread
                    out over about 10 years. We worked out an agreement with the North Koreans,
                    which remains in effect today, that the South Koreans would provide roughly 70
                    percent of the funding and the Japanese would provide roughly 20 or 25 percent
                    of the funding. We told our Congress that we wouldn't be financing the
                    construction of these light water reactors. The reason that the South Koreans
                    and the Japanese agreed to this is that, first, they thought that the overall
                    deal was in their interest, easing tensions in their region. Secondly, a lot of
                    South Korean and Japanese companies would expect to get the construction
                    contracts. Also this would intertwine North Korea and make it dependent on South
                    Korean and Japanese funding, construction, and engineering. Thus the agreement
                    would expose North Korea to Japanese and particularly South Korean personnel and
                    open up North Korean society to them. So there were a lot of reasons for Japan
                    and South Korea to agree to this.At that point there wasn't an Asian financial
                    crisis. Even Japan looked pretty rich at that point. Certainly, South Korea
                    didn't seem to have a financial problem.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, until North Korea got these new reactors built, with the old
                    reactors being frozen, North Korea claimed, and to a certain extent this was
                    plausible, that they had energy deficit problems. So we also agreed to provide a
                    certain amount of heavy fuel oil for electric power generation. I forget the
                    exact tonnage involved. The U.S. assumed the responsibility of getting help from
                    others and agreed to provide a major share of this help. There were a lot of
                    other details, but it boiled down to a commitment on our part of something like
                    $25-30 million a year over 10 years. A delay of several years would be involved
                    in finding out whether the North Koreans had plutonium for one or two nuclear
                    bombs in exchange for their freezing and then dismantling their entire nuclear
                    program and putting in its place something much safer and with Japan and South
                    Korea footing almost all of the bills. Now, I'm not claiming that this agreement
                    was perfect, but that the our rationale we used. None of the critics of the deal
                    have come up with a better solution to the crisis we faced in 1993-94.</p>
                <pb facs="0741" n="Page0741"/>
                <p>The South Koreans were nervous throughout this process because they weren't the
                    chief negotiators. The North Koreans always made it difficult for the South
                    Koreans. They continued to insult the South Koreans and President Kim Yong Sam
                    personally. So there always was a lot of tension involved, not only in working
                    on this agreement but in implementing it. The South Koreans didn't like the fact
                    that we couldn't uncover plutonium secrets. They weren't wild about this
                    agreement, but this wasn't a huge problem. They were concerned about the cost of
                    KEDO [Korean Economic Development Organization, set up to implement the deal],
                    but I've told you why they didn't mind going ahead. There were a lot of hard
                    liners in South Korea who didn't want to negotiate with North Korea. They
                    thought that this agreement might also tend to prop up North Korea. It was a
                    difficult choice for South Korea. It took some leaning on them to obtain their
                    agreement.We insisted, and I was very strong on this point, as was Gallucci,
                    that there would be a provision in the agreement that North Korea had to talk to
                    South Korea about the future of the Korean Peninsula. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dr. Nancy Bernkopf Tucker will be in attendance in this
                        section othe interview and may ask some questions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: With regard to Korea, our clear principle from the beginning was that North
                    Korea had to talk to South Korea. While we would take the lead on the nuclear
                    question, North Korea had to talk to South Korea and not skirt South Korea and
                    try to talk to us on questions like stability and peace on the Korean Peninsula
                    and a possible peace agreement, maintaining the armistice agreement of 1953, a
                    reunification agreement, and so forth. So we were prepared to walk away from the
                    agreement if North Korea did not talk to South Korea.</p>
                <p>The last crisis in the negotiations which Gallucci conducted was on this very
                    issue of a North-South dialogue. We said that, without such a dialogue, we
                    wouldn't have an agreement. So North Korea caved on that issue at the last
                    minute. That didn't mean that they immediately rushed to talk to the South
                    Koreans, but at least we had the principle accepted, which we could point
                    to.</p>
                <p>Throughout this process we kept our Japanese, Chinese, and Russian partners
                    closely involved. The Chinese generally supported the agreement. I don't know
                    whether they leaned on the North Koreans. They wouldn't tell you if they had,
                    and probably, as I said earlier, at this point they weren't quite prepared to be
                    as helpful as they were later on regarding the Korean question. However, they
                    were already generally constructive. We kept them very closely posted on this
                    issue. We asked them to work on the North Koreans and to try to get them to be
                    reasonable throughout this process. The Japanese and the Russians were generally
                    supportive. Of course, later on the Russians were upset when we had Four Power
                    Talks [involving the U.S., China, North Korea, and South Korea], because they
                    were left out. They preferred a Six Power approach.</p>
                <pb facs="0742" n="Page0742"/>
                <p>The Agreement which came out of negotiation with North Korea generally had a
                    positive reaction, including in the U.S. However, then, and ever since, there
                    has been some criticism of the agreement. I understand this to a certain extent,
                    although I have explained the very difficult choices we faced. I am convinced to
                    this day that the agreement as it was reached was the best outcome at the time
                    and one of the major achievements of the Clinton administration.</p>
                <p>There are those who just don't like dealing with the North Koreans. After all,
                    they are a nasty, brutish bunch. There are those who feel that several billion
                    dollars worth of light nuclear reactors, plus the heavy fuel oil provided to
                    North Korea amounted to rewarding brutish behavior, threats, buying off the
                    North Koreans, and bribing them. There are those who feel that the North Koreans
                    can't be trusted anyway. Also, many of the critics didn't like the fact that we
                    didn't discover whether they had one or two nuclear bombs. There were mixed
                    signals occasionally coming out of South Korea expressing doubts about the
                    agreement or about our fidelity to them, which in turn stirred our domestic
                    critics. At times we would have to slap certain of these South Koreans down, and
                    they would then deny having made these comments. Then we would find them leaking
                    the same views to someone else. This sort of fed conservative opposition to the
                    agreement at times.</p>
                <p>However, on the whole South Korea supported the agreement. Obviously, they would
                    have preferred their being more directly involved in the negotiating process.
                    They had some doubts but they basically supported it. We wouldn't have entered
                    into this agreement if they didn't support it, but it did take some leaning on
                    the South Koreans, as well as very tough negotiations with the North
                    Koreans.</p>
                <p>Of course, Japan, China, and Russia were very positive about the agreement. Ever
                    since then we've been working to implement the agreement. The most difficult
                    area on the domestic front, in concrete terms, has been to get enough funding
                    for the heavy fuel oil. Even as we speak the KEDO reactor expenses are coming
                    under pressure, but that's back loaded, there isn't a lot of heavy expense for
                    Japan and South Korea in the early period. KEDO's presence is a major part of
                    the agreement, i.e., sending a lot of South Koreans and other people up to North
                    Korea. It is beginning to have an impact on perceptions in North Korea, and
                    that's useful.</p>
                <p>The U.S. Congress has been reluctant to provide a lot of money for the heavy fuel
                    oil. We've had to pass the tin cup to countries all over the world, with mixed
                    success. Some countries in Asia have helped. Countries, like the Australians and
                    Singapore, have been moderately helpful. Some of the ASEAN countries and some of
                    the rich countries like Brunei have been dragging their feet. The other Asians
                    haven't been as helpful as they should have been. It took a long time to
                    convince the Europeans. Our Congress has been very reserved, so we've been
                    rolling over debts and achieving accounting miracles to try to keep this process
                    alive.</p>
                <pb facs="0743" n="Page0743"/>
                <p>The other problem, of course, is that every now and then the North Koreans try to
                    push the envelope on implementation, and they've engaged in suspicious activity.
                    They have suggested that there isn't enough U.S.-North Korean dialogue going, or
                    they're upset about something else, and they threaten to resume reprocessing
                    spent nuclear fuel or do something else. I can't tell whether the North Koreans
                    may be cheating here or there. There are always concerns about possible
                    activities which they may be hiding. The IAEA inspections which have gone
                    forward have often been pushed to the edge. The North Koreans chisel around the
                    edges and don't fully comply with the regulations. However, these shortcomings
                    are never quite enough to break the agreement. The North Koreans are a real pain
                    in the neck and you can't trust them. However, we're going to keep at them.
                    Again, in retrospect, I don't see any better approach.This agreement still could
                    blow up in view of the uncertainty of funding, giving the North Koreans either
                    an excuse or the cover to pull out of the agreement. They could shift their
                    views. They're never going to get a better or more forthcoming interlocutor than
                    Kim Dae Jung, who has been very forthcoming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kim Dae Jung is the new President of the Republic of

                </p>
                <p>LORD: He was elected President in January, 1998, I believe. He haonly been in
                    office for about six months at this point.</p>
                <p>So that's the basic story on the agreement, which I consider a major achievement.
                    However, the jury is still out on whether it will last for all time or whether
                    it will break down.</p>
                <p>Q: As we were dealing with the North Koreans, really for the first time, other
                    than in the sterile Panmunjom talks, were you, as Assistant Secretary, getting
                    any feel for what was going on in North Korea? There was also a defector in
                    play.</p>
                <p>LORD: That came later. The quick answer is, “No.” To this day none of us knows
                    what the hell is going on in North Korea. Obviously, we got a little bit of
                    sense of their negotiating style. We got a little sense of what's going on. We
                    had people at KEDO. I'll get into U.S.-North Korean direct relations in a
                    minute. Without getting overly sensitive here, our assets in North Korea are not
                    particularly strong. So we're just pretty much in the dark. I don't think our
                    friends know much more than others. There are certain, general conclusions that
                    we can reach. Kim Jong Il has generally been in charge. Obviously, the North
                    Korean military are very important. There probably are some disagreements
                    between the military, which is generally considered to be hard line and is more
                    concerned about keeping its nuclear options alive, than the North Korean Foreign
                    Ministry and economic types who are more worried about diplomatic relations with
                    the outside world and economic aid. They often play the usual game in
                    negotiations, saying: “We have hard liners at home. You have to help us convince
                    the hard liners by giving us some concessions,” and so on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We use Congress for that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's right. So it's hard to know how much of that is genuine. There may
                    be some of that. Some of it may just be negotiating tactics.</p>
                <p>I want to make clear that I didn't deal with the North Koreans. My deputy, Tom
                    Hubbard, or Bob Gallucci did. My Korean desk officer did a great many times,
                    through contacts at the UN in New York. We purposely did not give them the
                    protocol benefit of dealing with me. We used somebody lower ranking, except for
                    Bob Gallucci, who handled the nuclear negotiations. He was the highest ranking
                    U.S. official in touch with the North Koreans, and that was on a highly
                    selective basis. I had Tom Hubbard or the Korean Country Director contact the
                    North Koreans in New York, as I said. We never got to the point, in our
                    relations with them, that I would get involved, out of considerations of
                    sensitivity toward the South Koreans and the fact that the North Koreans were
                    generally not forthcoming.</p>
                <p>Part of the understanding of the Framework Agreement was to be an increased
                    dialogue between the U.S. and North Korea, including some relaxation of
                    sanctions. We always felt that broadening and expanding contacts with the North
                    Koreans, if they turned out to be at all reasonable, would be positive in terms
                    of gently subverting their system and opening them up to outside influences. The
                    general strategy was to integrate North Korea into the regional and world
                    system, so that they would be less paranoid and disruptive. They were a much
                    more extreme example of a closed society than China was and on a different
                    scale. But we were also very careful about this.</p>
                <p>In this context I always weighed in on the side of South Korea, frankly, in not
                    going too far with North Korea, until it began to talk to South Korea. There was
                    a constant process of jockeying with South Korea and a calculation of how much
                    we would talk with North Korea and about what subjects. I made it clear that we
                    would not get out in front of the South Koreans. I said this publicly and
                    privately during the many times that I went to South Korea to consult with them.
                    However, we didn't want to give the South Koreans full veto power over this
                    process.</p>
                <p>So we took minimum steps on sanctions early on, when the Framework Agreement was
                    first being implemented. We relaxed controls in a couple of areas. With the
                    North Koreans, we accorded them the bare minimum of relaxation of controls under
                    the Framework Agreement. There was really nothing much done economically or in
                    political terms. This wasn't particularly controversial in the U.S., even when
                    South Korea would get annoyed with the North Koreans. I think that we fulfilled
                    our obligations with North Korea under the Framework Agreement, but just barely.
                    We went slowly with North Korea because it was unhelpful and South Korea was
                    very sensitive.</p>
                <pb facs="0745" n="Page0745"/>
                <p>So we did enough with North Korea and we made clear that we were prepared to go
                    further. We always said that we couldn't do anything meaningful with the North
                    Koreans unless they were prepared to talk to South Korea. We said that the North
                    Koreans ought to be prepared to talk to the South Koreans, not to the U.S. We
                    said that we wouldn't talk to the North Koreans about South Korea. We said that
                    what we would talk to them about was their missile exports, their terrorism,
                    possible establishment of Liaison Offices, and possible further relaxation of
                    sanctions.</p>
                <p>We made it clear that we would tie the relaxation of tensions to how the North
                    Koreans dealt with South Korea and also how they acted on these problems. We
                    conducted separate negotiations on North Korean missiles but never got anywhere
                    with them. We discussed their taking steps on terrorism, but this did not lead
                    anywhere. We suggested that they could be more cooperative in the Military
                    Armistice Commission [MAC] or could let up on the rhetoric against President
                    Kim. There were several issues where we were trying to make progress. We sort of
                    inched along but really didn't get very far with them. Regarding the agreement
                    and the attitude which the North Koreans displayed toward South Korea, we
                    indicated that we wouldn't go very far unless North Koreans talked to South
                    Koreans. However, the North Koreans didn't make much of a move in this
                    direction. We thought that, on balance, if they made progress with the South,
                    and assuming that they were flexible enough on key issues, further interaction
                    with the North Koreans could be a positive development. It could give them more
                    of a stake in observing the framework agreement and being a responsible member
                    of the regional and world community.</p>
                <p>We never made much progress on any of these matters, even on the matter of the
                    establishment of Liaison Offices. Despite the fact that we got close to
                    agreement, we essentially held off because the South Koreans were sensitive
                    about that. Then later on, and ironically, when we got Four Power Talks going
                    and the South Koreans were more relaxed, the North Koreans were the ones who
                    dragged their feet. The North Koreans were worried about a foreign presence in
                    their capital, Pyongyang, and the impact this might have. We wanted to have a
                    presence up there and to have a better sense of what was going on in North
                    Korea. This development got hung up over the issue of whether we could send mail
                    pouches over the DMZ. The North Koreans insisted that these pouches would have
                    to go from Seoul to North Korea via China, or some place or another. We were
                    prepared to say that, in principle, we maintained the right to send pouches
                    directly from South to North Korea but that we were prepared to start off with a
                    more convoluted system. But the North Koreans weren't prepared to do even that.
                    So they are the ones who held up the establishment of Liaison Offices.</p>
                <p>In any case, we had sporadic contacts with North Korea - in full consultation
                    with South Korea - at the country director level in New York generally, and
                    occasionally through Tom Hubbard. We just didn't get very far, although we kept
                    pressing the North Koreans. We tried to get the Chinese to press the North
                    Koreans to talk to the South Koreans directly.</p>
                <pb facs="0746" n="Page0746"/>
                <p>There was one incident during the Christmas/New Year's holidays of 1994/1995. A
                    couple of American helicopter pilots went down in North Korea. I remember this
                    distinctly because my wife and I were planning to take a long-anticipated
                    vacation. We had lined up, well in advance, theater tickets to hit shows in New
                    York. We lined up five Broadway shows in a row between Christmas and early
                    January. Suddenly, there was this helicopter crash. One of the helicopter pilots
                    was killed, and the other one was captured. We wanted to get the body of the
                    dead pilot back and get the other pilot out of North Korean captivity. The name
                    of the captured pilot was Bobby Hall. To make a long story short, we needed
                    someone at a high level to be on duty around the clock on this incident. Peter
                    Tarnoff took this duty during the first couple of days and, of course, I took
                    the rest of the time. I not only wanted to do this but felt that I had an
                    obligation to be on hand. I hurried back to Washington and missed, God only
                    knows, what incredible shows in New York. I was in Washington for the next 10
                    days to two weeks. We managed this crisis effectively. We sent Tom Hubbard to
                    North Korea to arrange for the release of the pilot who had survived and to
                    retrieve the remains of the other, dead pilot.</p>
                <p>There were daily conference calls among the White House, either with Sandy Berger
                    or his Asian hand, Stan Roth, and whoever else was called in from the Department
                    of Defense, and with Ambassador Laney in South Korea and our military people
                    there. Often we had Tom Hubbard on an open line. We of course knew damned well
                    that the line was bugged and we said things purposefully for the North
                    Koreans.</p>
                <p>While we would report to our superiors, I was in daily charge of the coordination
                    of this effort to get instructions to Tom Hubbard. We let him know what to do.
                    We would double check with our superiors, although, during the end of the year
                    holidays, it wasn't easy.</p>
                <p>So I remember that there were often conference calls at 2:00 or 3:00 AM. It was a
                    pretty dramatic time. We got the surviving pilot out of North Korea and
                    recovered the remains of the dead pilot, without making any major concessions.
                    This was a good success, and I felt good about it. The only gesture to North
                    Korea was some convoluted reference to military talks at the DMZ, but we still
                    insisted on the South Koreans being involved. I forget what the formulation was.
                    The South Koreans were a little suspicious, but they were reassured when Tom
                    Hubbard came out and debriefed them. So that was a mini-crisis, but it could
                    have been a lot worse. It ruined my holiday, but of course it was crucial to
                    rescue our pilot. And I am proud of the job that Tom, our team, and I did.</p>
                <pb facs="0747" n="Page0747"/>
                <p>The other issue involving North Korea, of course, has been their terrible food
                    and famine problems, throughout this period. It got worse, particularly during
                    the last year or so when I was Assistant Secretary. Here we had a humanitarian
                    problem, of course, of helping the North Korean people. Even though the North
                    Koreans blamed this problem on floods, it was more the result of their lousy
                    system of food distribution and related, structural problems of agriculture.
                    Also their policy of feeding their cadre and military and not the people in
                    need. So, therefore, they had a flood disaster generally and then, particularly,
                    they had a food and famine disaster. Some NGOs [Non Governmental Organizations]
                    have estimated that there were a million or two million people who died of
                    starvation during this period. The NGO estimate may be exaggerated and we can't
                    be sure about the truth in that opaque society.</p>
                <p>Basically, the situation was a little tougher before Kim Dae Jung became
                    President of the Republic of Korea in January, 1998. We tried to square the
                    circle and show some humanitarian concern over the situation in North Korea.
                    There were some efforts in Congress to provide humanitarian aid to North Korea.
                    Other members of Congress said: “Why help these bastards? Their problems are
                    their own fault.” In effect, we said: “We have no objection to other countries
                    helping North Korea.” We provided some assistance, but only through
                    international organizations and not directly. And only with inspection of the
                    results to make sure that the food got to the North Korean people and not just
                    to the North Korean military. I am quite confident that most food aid we
                    provided got through to the people but there was surely also some diversion. It
                    was enough to relieve the immediate crisis of starvation, but not enough to let
                    the North Koreans off the hook. They needed to reform their system, which was
                    the real cause of the crisis.</p>
                <p>First of all, the North Korean system is all screwed up. In the second place we
                    have evidence that they diverted some of their food aid, not our food aid, but
                    aid coming from other sources. They don't allow inspectors from donating
                    agencies in countries providing assistance to go everywhere. At one point, when
                    Kim Young Sam was President of the Republic of Korea [1993-1998], the South
                    Koreans loaded ships with grain and sent them to North Korea. The North Koreans
                    seized these ships and raised the North Korean flag on them. So the North
                    Koreans just made it very tough to help them. Just as Saddam Hussein exploited
                    children in Iraq, the North Koreans were torn between wanting to get food and
                    admitting that they had a crisis. They wanted to get food but also, in many
                    respects, they wanted to get it for their military, and to hell with their
                    people. This was a very tough question. As I say, we provided enough assistance
                    to head off a disaster, but not enough to let the North Koreans off the
                    hook.</p>
                <p>Q: [Bernkopf] I don't know whether we've already covered this. Could you talk
                    about working with China on the nuclear crisis involving North Korea and the
                    agreed framework that was developed?</p>
                <pb facs="0748" n="Page0748"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes. This issue is certainly relevant here. From the very beginning of my
                    term as Assistant Secretary I thought that it was important, as did the
                    administration, to work as much as we could with China on the problem of North
                    Korea. In the first place it was the most urgent and dangerous problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] Can you explain what the problem was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: We'll do this again briefly. When we entered office, the North Koreans were
                    refusing some IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspections of some of
                    their nuclear facilities, which they were obligated to have inspected under the
                    NPT [Non Proliferation Treaty], which North Korea had signed.</p>
                <p>This issue came to a head after we entered office, when the North Koreans
                    threatened to withdraw from the NPT. We threatened to apply sanctions, built up
                    our forces, and went to the UN. The North Koreans were saying that the
                    imposition of sanctions could lead to war. It was a very tense situation, which
                    I have dealt with in more detail.</p>
                <p>This was the most urgent security problem that we faced, certainly in Asia and
                    perhaps during the first year or two of the whole Administration. We thought
                    that it was important to involve China, for several reasons.</p>
                <p>First, we thought that China probably had more influence with the North Korean
                    regime than anyone else, although we knew that the North Koreans were prickly
                    and weren't going to take orders from anybody. In terms of influence with North
                    Korea the Chinese certainly eclipsed the Russians, although we also wanted to
                    stay in touch with the Russians also on this issue. So the Chinese were going to
                    be a crucial factor in restraining North Korea, as they already were a crucial
                    factor in propping up North Korea economically.</p>
                <p>Secondly, we felt that there were some parallel objectives in this situation.
                    China already had an important economic relationship with South Korea, which was
                    growing. The Chinese had fish to fry with the South Koreans. We were quite sure
                    that for a considerable period of time the Chinese had been restraining North
                    Korea from any military adventures, because they didn't want to be dragged back
                    into a possible conflict on the Korean Peninsula, as they had been during the
                    1950s. The Chinese didn't want to complicate their relations with the U.S. and
                    Japan, not to mention South Korea. Generally, China didn't want a war,
                    particularly with nuclear implications, right on their border. So China had been
                    a source of restraint on North Korea. The Chinese were becoming much more even
                    handed now that they had interests in South Korea. There was a parallel linkage
                    between Chinese contacts with the two Koreas.</p>
                <pb facs="0749" n="Page0749"/>
                <p>Thirdly and more broadly, we felt that by cooperating on this issue we could also
                    demonstrate that we had regional, global, and strategic interests with China on
                    our agenda. Perhaps we could agree to cooperate in other areas and achieve
                    better exchanges on regional security matters, for example. In this way we could
                    demonstrate to the American and Chinese publics that China and the U.S. could
                    work together on some of these regional and global issues.</p>
                <p>So for all of these reasons we put a high priority on dealing with the Chinese,
                    and we worked with them throughout my four years as Assistant Secretary of
                    State.</p>
                <p>Generally, in the course of those four years and since I have left that position
                    as well, the Chinese have become more cooperative, without going so far as to be
                    in lock step with us. In the exchange of information during this four year
                    period and since then we did not get much out of the Chinese at all; they would
                    profess not to have a great deal of information on North Korea. They generally
                    told us that the situation in North Korea was not as bad as people had been
                    saying and that, in particular, the economic situation was not as bad as many
                    people believed. They told us that the situation was stable. They were not
                    particularly candid with us, to say the least. By contrast, over the past couple
                    of years the Chinese have acknowledged that the economic situation in North
                    Korea is very serious, although they have emphasized that the political
                    situation is relatively stable.I want to make it clear that they have not always
                    been entirely helpful. However, they have been increasingly helpful throughout
                    the past few years. The Chinese have always been careful to guard their flank
                    with North Korea, but we sensed a clear frustration on China's part with North
                    Korea. First, because of the dangers involved and, secondly, because North Korea
                    has such an opaque regime which is very difficult to deal with. This was
                    accentuated by the fact that the Chinese had long, personal associations with
                    Kim Il Sung, but when he died, he was replaced by his somewhat flakey son [Kim
                    Jong Il]. As a result, Chinese personal ties with North Korea were consequently
                    reduced.</p>
                <p>The Chinese were also frustrated that they had been urging the North Koreans for
                    some time to reform their economy as the Chinese had done. The North Koreans had
                    resisted that advice because they were worried about losing political control of
                    the country to outside influences. So the Chinese had to bail out North Korea
                    economically.</p>
                <p>For all of these reasons over time the Chinese were increasingly concerned about
                    the situation in North Korea. In addition, the Chinese have had greater
                    exchanges of information with us, they have come to have greater trust in us,
                    and have had greater contact with South Korea. They have become somewhat more
                    helpful to us, although they have never moved in lock step with us.</p>
                <pb facs="0750" n="Page0750"/>
                <p>This has meant that the quality and quantity of their exchanges of information
                    with us on North Korea expanded over these years. This meant that, after
                    considerable delay, they finally agreed to join the Four Party Approach [North
                    Korea, South Korea, China, and the United States], which was helpful in the
                    effort to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. Most of the talks in that
                    context have been at the technical level. There has only been a couple of talks
                    at the Deputy Assistant Secretary level until after I left the State Department.
                    However, as I understand it, the Chinese have moved from a position of not being
                    particularly helpful or being passive or sometimes even taking the North Korean
                    side, to the point of actually facilitating talks and the four party approach.
                    The Chinese never joined KEDO, which is an organization set up to help provide
                    alternative and less dangerous, nuclear reactors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Kennedy] Is that spelled K-E-D-O?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, it deals with North Korea. So that has been frustrating. The Chinese
                    have provided a great deal of economic assistance to North Korea, including food
                    and oil, which has kept it from collapsing, more than any other factor. As I
                    say, diplomatically the Chinese have recently been more helpful.</p>
                <p>So this is a theme in all of the regional and global issues. This is the first
                    one that we can cite in terms of pointing to the fact that we have some parallel
                    interests with China, in spite of our ideological and other differences. This is
                    an area where the Chinese have been constructive. They haven't always been
                    perfect. We've had a lot of trouble during this period about military contacts
                    at the DMZ [Demilitarized Zone] at Panmunjom in Korea. The North Koreans have
                    constantly challenged the armistice agreement of 1953 and have demanded a peace
                    agreement. They have tried to force outside countries acting as observers to
                    withdraw from Panmunjom. We've had less than all out help from the Chinese on
                    that. Even on that, their attitude was nuanced. They wouldn't pressure the North
                    Koreans or back us fully on some of these issues. However, they would make the
                    point to the North that the armistice agreement still was in place, until a
                    peace agreement could replace it.</p>
                <p>So the Chinese were still somewhat worried about their North Korean flank.
                    However, on the whole the Chinese involvement in Korea was helpful. They
                    obviously helped to put pressure on North Korea and they helped to prop up North
                    Korea so that it didn't collapse. They demonstrated that we had shared interests
                    which supported the Chinese-American bilateral relationship in general.</p>
                <p>Q: Why don't we turn now to bilateral relations between the U.S. and South Korea?
                    I think we had some economic issues outstanding. What was your feeling about the
                    political situation in South Korea? How did you think South Korea was handling
                    its foreign policy? Are there any other issues that you might want to
                    discuss?</p>
                <pb facs="0751" n="Page0751"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes. I think that we can cover these issues fairly quickly. We've already
                    covered them, to a certain extent. One of my major concerns was to make sure
                    that we had as much solidarity as possible with the South Koreans, even though
                    we sometimes had a prickly and paranoid President of South Korea to deal with. I
                    have already indicated that we worked hard on that matter, as did others. It was
                    not just me. Also included were Secretary of State Christopher and Secretary of
                    Defense Perry.</p>
                <p>Throughout the four years I served as Assistant Secretary, our primary
                    preoccupation with South Korea was dealing with North Korea. We had economic
                    issues in dispute with South Korea, but we actually had a trade surplus with
                    them. So, in terms of trade, it wasn't as pronounced a problem as it was with
                    Japan or China. When I initially got the job as Assistant Secretary for East
                    Asian and Pacific Affairs, one of the first things that I did was to meet with
                    American business people in New York. Hank Greenberg, a major businessman and
                    head of a large insurance company, pulled together a lot of American business
                    people interested in Asia. We went around the table and asked them what was the
                    most difficult place in East Asia to do business in, particularly in terms of
                    American investment. Almost unanimously, they said South Korea, more than Japan,
                    China, or any other place.</p>
                <p>So we obviously spent some time on the trade issues. We finally got South Korea
                    into the OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]. This was
                    all before the financial crisis in Asia, which occurred after I left office. We
                    instituted semi-annual consultations on economic issues, addressing
                    macroeconomic as well as specific trade issues. I would raise these issues when
                    I went to South Korea. Secretary of State Christopher and others would raise
                    them. However, in all candor, although they were significant issues, they took
                    up a very small percentage of our time and attention, compared to the nuclear
                    question, the North-South talks, and North-South security questions.</p>
                <p>South Korea generally could be counted on to help us on UN issues, but they were
                    so preoccupied with their own security questions that we didn't expect much, nor
                    did they do much in other areas. We consulted closely with South Korea on
                    regional issues, such as, for example, the ASEAN Regional Forum [ARF]. We worked
                    with them in APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum] in terms of economic
                    advancement. However, in relative terms the economic dimension wasn't relatively
                    that significant, compared to the security dimension. I think that that's the
                    correct proportion. This doesn't mean that the American economic agencies didn't
                    spend a lot of time on economic issues. I'm simply saying that I didn't spend
                    too much time on these issues, although when I talked with them I pressed them,
                    as I always did, on general and specific economic, trade, and investment
                    problems.</p>
                <pb facs="0752" n="Page0752"/>
                <p>We had some difficulties in our bilateral relations with South Korea because, as
                    I've suggested, President Kim Young Sam was rather volatile. The South Koreans
                    were understandably frustrated at not participating in negotiations with North
                    Korea on nuclear weapons, although we consulted with them closely. The South
                    Koreans were understandably suspicious of North Korea. First of all, it was
                    North Korea which invaded South Korea in 1950. The North Koreans assassinated a
                    good part of the South Korean cabinet in Burma in the mid-1960s and tried to
                    kill the Prime Minister not so many years ago. The North Koreans made at least
                    one raid on the Blue House [South Korean Presidential Residence] in an effort to
                    assassinate President Park Chung Hee. On this occasion they killed Park Chung
                    Hee's wife. The North Koreans continually insulted President Kim Young Sam
                    personally and the South Koreans in general. They threatened South Korea by
                    deploying their troops near the DMZ, close to Seoul.So there was every reason
                    for the South Koreans to be suspicious of North Korea. Even those South Koreans
                    who wanted to be somewhat more flexible would have to be concerned with
                    understandable South Korean public and Parliamentary suspicion of North Korea.
                    Therefore, the combination of the suspicion of North Korea in the general body
                    politic and on the part of the South Korean leaders was such that they could be,
                    at times, overly sensitive on North Korea. I was sympathetic with South Koreans
                    on these grounds. This was in addition to the fact that North Korea had been
                    trying, for decades, to deal with us directly and push the South Koreans aside.
                    So for all of these reasons it was clear that we had a difficult partner in
                    South Korea but one that we wanted to be sympathetic with.</p>
                <p>It was therefore important for President Clinton to go to South Korea after Japan
                    on his first trip to Asia, indeed to anywhere. President Clinton hosted a state
                    visit to the United States by President Kim Young Sam, which was quite
                    successful. I think that this visit took place early in 1995.</p>
                <p>After we reached the Agreed Framework Agreement with North Korea, our big effort
                    was to get talks going between North and South Korea. We tried to accomplish
                    this by pressing the North Koreans and making clear that we would hold back on
                    developing our relationship with them until they talked with South Korea. We
                    encouraged the Chinese and others to weigh in on North Korea to talk with South
                    Korea. We pointed to North Korea's obligations to do this in the Framework
                    Agreement. However, this was like pulling teeth, and we never really got any
                    results on this.</p>
                <pb facs="0753" n="Page0753"/>
                <p>Finally, at the instigation of President Kim Young Sam, he and President Clinton
                    agreed on a bold new initiative of Four Power talks, to include South Korea, the
                    United States, China, and North Korea. Obviously, strictly North-South talks
                    would have been better, and that's what we wanted. However, failing that, the
                    South Koreans agreed, and we, of course, agreed with them, that we ought to try
                    this other approach. The rationale was as follows. First, the parties included
                    were signatories to the Armistice Agreement [of 1953]. The Chinese had fought in
                    Korea, so they were a party to the Armistice Agreement. Therefore, in addition
                    to geography, history, economics, and ideological ties with North Korea and
                    improving ties with South Korea in their direct interest, they had that
                    rationale. The Japanese had not been a signatory to the Armistice Agreement.</p>
                <p>Secondly, you never could tell whether the North Koreans welcomed the Chinese or
                    not. On balance, they probably didn't. They didn't like trilateral discussions
                    involving North and South Korea and the U.S., which made the balance two against
                    one. Then the North Koreans may have thought that, since China was shifting
                    somewhat toward South Korea, this might make the balance three against one.
                    Ostensibly, the Four Power talks were designed to be two communist powers over
                    here and two good guys [the ROK and the U.S.] over there. So there was that
                    cover. We were very careful to make sure that the Japanese, in particular, were
                    comfortable with this arrangement. They were and they never gave us any trouble
                    on this. They understood the rationale of the Armistice and they understood that
                    if they were included, the Russians would have to be included. This would have
                    meant Six Power Talks, which we thought would be too complicated. We of course
                    continued to consult closely with Japan, both bilaterally and together with
                    South Korea.</p>
                <p>The Russians were very upset about this. They thought that they had a legitimate
                    interest in Korea and wanted to know why they were not included in these talks.
                    As I said, we never had formal consultations with the Russians on this subject.
                    In informal talks with them we basically said that we saw some value in Six
                    Power talks at some point, whether for guarantees or other purposes. Therefore,
                    we could see that a Six Power arrangement might have some function. However,
                    meantime we told the Russians that we would keep them closely informed, and why
                    didn't they join KEDO? They have not been happy about their not being included
                    in these consultative talks.</p>
                <pb facs="0754" n="Page0754"/>
                <p>The other rationale for the four-party approach on Korea, however, was that if we
                    got four parties together, then, under that cover and around the edges of that
                    conference, we could promote a North-South dialogue. The North Koreans have
                    resisted talking to South Korea for so long that, for reasons of cover, it was
                    easier for them to talk to South Korea directly as long as everyone was in the
                    same city for the Four Power talks. Also, the carrot for North Korea was that
                    that meant that they could talk to us as well. So we made it clear that if North
                    Korea came to the table in the Four Power talks, we wanted to urge that North
                    and South Korea conduct the basic negotiations, with the Chinese and us being in
                    a facilitative role. However, the North Koreans would also have the benefit of
                    talking directly to us, which they wanted. As against that, they would also have
                    to talk directly to South Korea as well, which they may not have wanted.</p>
                <p>For all of these reasons this was announced at Cheju Island, when President
                    Clinton met there with South Korean President Kim Young Sam, I believe in the
                    summer of 1995. I was there for this meeting.</p>
                <p>We spent the rest of the first Clinton term trying getting the North Koreans to
                    move ahead in the talks. They would inch along in talks at the Country Director
                    level at the UN in New York. We tried to get the Chinese to weigh in. The
                    Chinese were supportive, but they weren't prepared to pull out all the stops.
                    They kept arguing more U.S.-North Korean movement. As always, the North Koreans
                    were a pain in the neck. They would inch up to the starting line and give us the
                    impression that we were going to get the four-party talks started. Basically, we
                    only had talks about the talks. We never had actual talks. Instead, there were
                    talks to see whether we could have talks. We finally reached the point where we
                    could have four-party talks at the level of my deputy, Tom Hubbard [Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary of State]. Since I left the Department of State, my
                    successor has had a couple of rounds of fruitless discussions at the Assistant
                    Secretary level.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, recently elected South Korean President Kim Dae Jung has been more
                    forthcoming toward North Korea. He has encouraged U.S. investment and U.S.-North
                    Korean direct talks, including relaxing our sanctions. He has himself opened his
                    arms to the North Koreans but so far has been rewarded by considerable
                    intransigence, although the rhetoric from North Korea has been more
                    restrained.</p>
                <p>There was another complication in U.S.-South Korean relations. I don't have the
                    exact date, but late in the first Clinton term, probably in 1995 or 1996, a
                    North Korean submarine stranded in South Korean territorial waters. There were
                    both North Korean commandos and sailors on it. The commandos killed all of the
                    sailors, and many of the commandos escaped. There was a big manhunt all over
                    South Korea. Some of the North Korean commandos were captured, and some South
                    Koreans were killed. This caused a furor in South Korea and held up any movement
                    toward talks or anything else with North Korea.</p>
                <pb facs="0755" n="Page0755"/>
                <p>Again, during this time I spent a good deal of time holding the hands of the
                    South Koreans, pledging U.S. solidarity with them. I remember that once I
                    arrived on a trip to South Korea, and there was a big cartoon in a South Korean
                    newspaper which showed a South Korean watching television. The video was all
                    screwed up. It was on the blink. It just wasn't working. The heading of the
                    cartoon referring to the video said: “U.S.-South Korean Relations.” The cartoon
                    showed me coming in through the window. The caption showed me saying: “I'm here
                    to fix your television set.”</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have the feeling or was it conventional wisdom that the North Korean
                    infiltrations, such as the case of the North Korean submarine, may have been
                    designed by the North Korean military to louse things up?</p>
                <p>LORD: That's a very good question. That is one explanation of this incident.
                    However, it seemed to us to be somewhat inconceivable that the North Korean
                    military could do this without the blessing of Kim Jong Il, the son of Kim Il
                    Sung and the apparent ruler of North Korea, or at least his acquiescence. The
                    North Korean military couldn't have just done it on their own. So to this day,
                    since we don't know anything about North Korea anyway, we don't know what
                    happened. We do feel, without falling into the trap of good guys and bad guys
                    battling within the Politburo of the Communist Party, that there are some people
                    in North Korea, probably within the Foreign Ministry and the economic agencies,
                    who want to implement the Framework Agreement and get outside help. There are
                    others, probably including most of the military, who are hardliners. There are
                    probably even some who would like to sabotage the agreement.</p>
                <p>So if I had to hazard an explanation of this incident, I think that this
                    infiltration incident was an ongoing thing which they did all the time. They
                    didn't launch it specifically to screw things up. They didn't want to be caught.
                    If you're not caught, you don't screw things up. So this was ongoing, and
                    probably Kim Jong Il was kept posted. He probably said: “Just because we're
                    negotiating with the Americans, we don't stop our intelligence activity. Just
                    don't get caught.” So they went ahead and screwed up.</p>
                <p>Q: This is something like our U-2 incident in May, 1960, when we launched a U-2
                    flight just before a scheduled meeting between President Eisenhower and Prime
                    Minister Khrushchev.</p>
                <pb facs="0756" n="Page0756"/>
                <p>LORD: So, to return to the North Korean submarine episode, there were some who
                    felt that this was done deliberately to sabotage relations with South Korea. My
                    instinct, without my being sure about it, is that it was something that was
                    fairly regularly done. Maybe it wasn't really done regularly, because there
                    weren't all of that many North Korean commandos. Maybe this operation was
                    approved at a higher level than usual. Perhaps it was something that they
                    decided not to stop, and they got caught in the act of trying to infiltrate
                    personnel into South Korea. If they didn't get caught, as I said, it would not
                    have destroyed anything. So this incident strained relations with the South
                    Koreans and with South Korean public opinion.We managed to get things back on
                    track. We stressed solidarity with the South. We pressed the North Koreans over
                    time, and if you can believe this, we finally got an apology out of the North
                    Koreans, which is probably the greatest diplomatic achievement in the history of
                    foreign policy with North Korea. I forget how half assed the apology was. It
                    was, in any case, an expression of regret by the North Koreans, which got things
                    back on track.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, is there anything else that you would like to say
                        abouNorth Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I think we've just about covered it.</p>
                <p>Q: Just one question. Did that incident involving a high level North Korean
                    defector occur on your watch as Assistant Secretary? Did this add anything to
                    our knowledge of North Korea?</p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, it did happen on my watch. This incident didn't really add anything.
                    There were some reports that this defector said that North Korea had a nuclear
                    capability. We couldn't tell whether ROK [Republic of Korea] intelligence, which
                    is very hard line, leaked this or whether the defector was misinformed or simply
                    deduced things. The North Koreans are capable of anything. We had the usual
                    trouble of getting direct access to these defectors. Right away, the South
                    Koreans would often use them for propaganda purposes. They were still getting
                    information from this defector after I left the Department of State. I don't
                    believe that we actually learned a great deal from him, either directly or
                    indirectly. This defector was one of North Korea's top ideological types. I
                    think that the general conclusion was that he wasn't totally plugged in to what
                    was going on in North Korea. That is my impression, but I could be totally wrong
                    on that.</p>
                <p>There was one other, mini-crisis, in which a South Korean in the U.S. was caught
                    spying. I believe that he may have been a businessman, but he was someone
                    connected with the South Korean Intelligence Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that he was caught in Los Angeles.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0757" n="Page0757"/>
                <p>LORD: I thought that it was in New York. However, in any event, we expelled him
                    and expressed our displeasure. We didn't want to have that kind of activity
                    disrupt our relationship with South Korea or give any incentive to North Korea.
                    You know, even among the best of friends these things happen. The U.S. has spied
                    on France - although I am not sure that we are the best of friends.</p>
                <p>The other thing is that we always were a little concerned about the South Koreans
                    keeping us totally informed. We went out of our way, and, again, I kept on
                    pressing this point, to keep the South Koreans fully consulted, informed, and
                    debriefed on all of our talks with the North Koreans. However, there was
                    evidence that the South Koreans were not always totally open with us. They were
                    making some gestures to North Korea, secretly. They didn't have much success in
                    these efforts, but they weren't keeping us posted about them. We would
                    occasionally make references to the need to keep the communications flowing in
                    both directions. So that was a simmering problem, not a major one.</p>
                <p>Q: Why not stop at this point? We'll note at the end of this section that we've
                    covered relations with China, with North and South Korea, and with Japan. So
                    we're ready to move on to the rest of Asia during this 1993-1997 period.</p>
                <p>***XXVI. STATE DEPARTMENT ASSISTANT SECRETARY - ASEAN, SOUTHEAST
                    ASI(1993-1997)</p>
                <p>Today is October 21, 1998. We might now look at some of the other issues. I'm
                    going to leave it to you to pick the matters to raise as we go along. They're
                    almost completely separate issues. So if you will name them, we'll start
                    off.</p>
                <p>LORD: Okay. What I would propose to start off with is ASEAN, both collectively
                    and in terms of its individual members. This would include the newer members,
                    such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Burma. Then we'll pick up Australia, New
                    Zealand, Mongolia, and the other pieces of Asia that we haven't covered already.
                    We can then look at some regional approaches, whether it is APEC, ASEAN and
                    regional security matters, global problems like the environment, and then the
                    whole question of promoting democracy and human rights, as well as the Asian
                    values debate. Then I might cover my more general recollections on the four
                    years of my service in the Bureau of East Asian Affairs, after we've gotten
                    through these individual pieces. Okay?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. In the first place you mentioned ASEAN. Can you
                        telme what ASEAN stands for?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0758" n="Page0758"/>
                <p>LORD: Sure. ASEAN stands for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. It's an
                    organization of several countries of Southeast Asia which was established 25 or
                    30 years ago. It originally consisted of Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia,
                    Malaysia, and Singapore. Then it added Brunei a few years ago. In more recent
                    years it has added Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Burma. Of course, the addition
                    of the countries of the former Indochina and Burma has complicated ASEAN's
                    performance. I won't dwell on this, because most of it happened since I left
                    office as Assistant Secretary. These additions have added poor countries to
                    other countries which were generally regarded as economic tigers. It also added
                    generally authoritarian or semi-authoritarian governments to a grouping which
                    was mixed but had a considerable degree of political freedom. So the addition of
                    some of these newer members has affected the cohesion of ASEAN.</p>
                <p>ASEAN started out essentially for economic purposes to promote economic progress
                    among these countries and also to damp down regional and historical tensions
                    between Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand. There have been
                    disputes among these countries, one way or another. Even as the European
                    Community was meant, in part, to ease historical antagonisms and prevent future
                    conflicts between France and Germany, for example, so, although on a less
                    grandiose scale, one of the purposes of ASEAN was to try to mute these rivalries
                    and to promote cooperation among these countries.</p>
                <p>What started out as an economic grouping also began to take on some political and
                    diplomatic force as well. As the Clinton administration came into office in
                    1993, obviously the giants of China and Japan, as well as South Korea, given the
                    historical involvement of U.S. troops, captured a great deal of our attention,
                    including continuing public and media attention in the U.S.</p>
                <p>However, we have become very much aware of the fact that Southeast Asia,
                    including ASEAN, is also crucially important, both collectively and in terms of
                    its individual members. For example, as ASEAN heads toward the year 2000, and
                    with its new members, the 10 members comprising all of the Southeast Asian
                    region, have a population of some 400 million. If you take the ASEAN countries
                    collectively, this group of states has already become roughly our fourth largest
                    export partner. These countries are located in a very strategic area, which
                    includes the Straits of Malacca and the passage of oil and trade through there,
                    which affects not only the U.S. but also key allies like Japan. Therefore, ASEAN
                    is very strategically located.</p>
                <pb facs="0759" n="Page0759"/>
                <p>Of course, the ASEAN area also has historical resonance because of our
                    involvement in Vietnam. Indeed, the Vietnam War, while a tragedy and a mistake,
                    in my view, had a clear silver lining in the dark clouds - the fact that by our
                    involvement in Vietnam we bought time for the Southeast Asian countries. Whether
                    you believe in the domino theory or not, the Vietnam War did give them some time
                    to develop, with the buffer of U.S. involvement in Vietnam and, in a certain
                    sense, in Laos and Cambodia, to protect them. This allowed these Southeast Asian
                    nations to get on their feet and not only not be taken over by communism but to
                    begin to develop their own, free market approach and their own economies. In
                    fact, they became economic giants.</p>
                <p>I would like to enter a little footnote here. We'll get to APEC later, but when
                    President Clinton was about to make a speech at the APEC meeting in Seattle, he
                    was going over his speech drafts. When he was traveling out to Seattle on Air
                    Force One [aircraft on which the President usually travels], he noticed a phrase
                    which he thought was terrific. The phrase said that the Asian countries had
                    grown from dominos to dynamos. He told the speech writer, who was going over the
                    text with the President, that this phrase was terrific. The speechwriter very
                    generously said: “Oh, that was Win Lord's phrase.” So when the President
                    actually gave the speech in Seattle at the APEC meeting, he got applause when he
                    got to that line. The President stopped, looked in the camera, and said: “I have
                    Winston Lord to thank for that line. I'm glad that you liked it.” There never
                    has been a more generous speechwriter. You can appreciate that when the
                    President says something, the speechwriter should not take credit for a given
                    phrase; but citing to the President somebody else for the phrase was an act of
                    generosity that I will never forget.</p>
                <p>Again, as we speak today, we see some serious economic problems in the Southeast
                    Asian region. However, on the whole, during the last 25 years a lot of the
                    tigers in Asia have been in the Southeast Asian grouping. The movement toward
                    freer trade among the Southeast Asian countries of ASEAN, as well as the
                    political and security stability among them which ASEAN fostered, had a lot to
                    do with their very dramatic economic growth. Also, of course, the U.S. security
                    presence in Asia helped to provide stability for ASEAN as well as for many other
                    countries, including even China. This allowed the people of these countries to
                    focus on improving their economies and not having to worry about conflict.</p>
                <pb facs="0760" n="Page0760"/>
                <p>In any event, we saw ASEAN as important. As I said, ASEAN as a group is already
                    the fourth largest partner of the U.S. in terms of trade. It has 400 million
                    people and 10 member countries. It is in an important geographical position. We
                    have two treaty allies among the ASEAN countries, Thailand and the Philippines.
                    There is also this huge country, Indonesia, the fourth largest country in the
                    world in terms of population, and the world's largest Muslim country. Also, in
                    terms of military cooperation, many of the ASEAN countries are also providing
                    us, under bilateral agreements, port and airfield access, joint exercises, and
                    military exchange programs to compensate for our withdrawal from our former
                    bases in the Philippines. So countries like Singapore, and even Malaysia and
                    Brunei, and others, to a certain extent, participate in cooperative efforts to
                    help maintain the U.S. presence in the area. That's in addition to our treaty
                    allies.</p>
                <p>In addition, ASEAN collectively has become increasingly important as a diplomatic
                    force. The ASEAN countries usually speak with one voice in international
                    organizations like the United Nations, giving them further clout. They also act
                    collectively as a diplomatic instrument. A good example of this is Cambodia.
                    ASEAN worked very hard with the United Nations, the United States, France, and
                    others to hold the elections in that country in 1993 and achieve the general,
                    UN-sponsored settlement there. Under Indonesian leadership ASEAN has tried to
                    settle questions involving the islands of the South China Sea. ASEAN is also a
                    significant force in APEC, the regional economic grouping which we'll talk about
                    later. It also has been the core of a movement to promote a regional security
                    dialogue. When the Clinton administration came into office, we had a security
                    dialogue with ASEAN and other, outside countries, and then collective meetings
                    in the context of what ASEAN called the “Post-Ministerial Conference,” for
                    discussions with other powers outside of ASEAN. These discussions were held
                    between ASEAN and these powers outside of it once a year, after the ASEAN
                    ministers have met. We then created the ASEAN Regional Forum in July 1994,
                    grouping these countries and adding China, Russia, Vietnam, etc. We'll discuss
                    that later.</p>
                <p>So, for all of these reasons we thought that it was important to pay a lot of
                    attention to ASEAN and its individual members, even though a lot of our energies
                    were directed toward Northeast Asia. In my own case I made many trips, both
                    ASEAN-related and bilaterally to the individual countries. Every time that there
                    was a group meeting with ASEAN, it gave us a chance to have bilateral meetings
                    as well, of course. I would go out to Southeast Asia every spring to help to
                    prepare regional security dialogues, at my senior official level, with my
                    counterparts. I was able to establish very important and productive
                    relationships. This would be followed, a couple of months later, by ministerial
                    meetings on regional security. I would go out to the area again with the
                    Secretary of State to attend these meetings. He would use the occasion to tack
                    on other trips to other Asian countries, even as he went, normally in July, to
                    the ASEAN meetings. This was an annual way of getting top level officials out to
                    the region, even as APEC, which we'll talk about later, did the same thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0761" n="Page0761"/>
                <p>Q: When you are talking about regional security, normally you are pointing at a
                    threat, or something like that. It sounds as if there was no longer a
                    threat.</p>
                <p>LORD: Could we come back to the regional security meetings before we go into
                    that? I thought that I would treat that separately in the context of the ASEAN
                    Regional Forum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: ASEAN was crucial for the regional forum, but this included many other
                    members, and I would rather do this under the general rubric of regional
                    institutions. That's a good question.I also made a considerable effort to meet,
                    not only my own counterparts, but also foreign ministers during the general
                    debate at the UN General Assembly each fall, when the Secretary of State was too
                    busy to meet with some of them. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>I'll go through the specific countries.</p>
                <p>Indonesia was clearly the giant in ASEAN by virtue of its population. We had a
                    mixed relationship with Indonesia. The difficulties lay in the human rights
                    area. Indonesia had an authoritarian regime, a lot of corruption, and a problem
                    with East Timor which Indonesia had taken over from the Portuguese back in the
                    1970s. There was a movement for the independence of East Timor or at least much
                    greater autonomy. There was also somewhat similar unrest in Aceh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's at the northern end of Sumatra.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Right. So Indonesia was a constant concern of human rights groups and
                    others. It put a certain limit on our relationship with Indonesia. Indeed, every
                    time that the President, the Secretary of State, or I met with our Indonesian
                    counterparts, in addition to a very positive agenda, which I'll get to in a
                    minute, we would usually raise East Timor or human rights issues. So this was a
                    controlling factor preventing us from having a full blown relationship with
                    Indonesia.</p>
                <p>Having said that, I should add that we had a very positive agenda as well, and we
                    treated Indonesia as a very important country, even though we disapproved of
                    some of its human rights practices. As I've already mentioned, it's the fourth
                    largest country in the world in terms of population, it's the largest Muslim
                    country in the world, and is generally very moderate in its approach to Islam,
                    as opposed to radical fundamentalism elsewhere in the world. So it's an
                    important example of toleration and general restraint in that area.</p>
                <pb facs="0762" n="Page0762"/>
                <p>Indonesia provided us with some military cooperation. Some of our training
                    activities with the Indonesian military were restricted by Congressional
                    concerns over human rights. Some of the Indonesian leaders whom we trained were
                    enlightened in terms of the rule of civilians over the military, legal justice,
                    and human rights practices by the Indonesian Army. However, there were some
                    graduates of U.S. training programs who turned out to be involved in the
                    suppression of some groups, and this caused controversy. So there was a constant
                    debate about how much we should cooperate with the Indonesian military which, of
                    course, is a very important political force in Indonesia. In fact, it's the
                    dominant political force. We generally felt that through the exchange programs
                    and joint operations we exposed Indonesian military personnel to professionalism
                    and attitudes toward democracy and human rights which would pay off and would be
                    good over the long term, on the whole.</p>
                <p>However, given the Indonesian military role in East Timor and in other areas, you
                    can see why Congress had some concern. However, we had some access for U.S. Navy
                    ship visits and training programs with the Indonesian military, so that there
                    was a military dimension to these activities.</p>
                <p>Indonesia is an important country economically, as well. It has been a
                    significant and positive force in diplomacy. Often it led ASEAN activity. As I
                    said already, in the South China Sea Indonesia didn't have any territorial
                    claims of its own and therefore could play a less subjective role, holding
                    workshops and trying to promote cooperation among the ASEAN countries and with
                    Vietnam before it became a member of ASEAN. Indonesia was also very important
                    with respect to diplomacy regarding Cambodia and efforts made to try to reach a
                    cease-fire there and organize elections. On that issue, as on so many others,
                    its very dynamic Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas, was a crucial player.</p>
                <p>Indonesian troops were involved in UN peacekeeping in various areas. Indonesia
                    was an important player in the regional security dialogues. In November, 1994,
                    Indonesia was the host to the APEC meeting in Bogor [West Java], where it
                    supported the objectives of free trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region
                    by the year 2020 and for developed countries by the year 2010, which were set
                    forth under the leadership of President Suharto.</p>
                <p>Of course, Indonesia was very strategically located, as I already indicated. So
                    for all of these reasons we had many goals of a positive nature to pursue in
                    Indonesia. However, we were somewhat constrained by various human rights
                    problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While we're on Indonesia, were we looking at Suharto's
                        eventuasuccessor and how Suharto was doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0763" n="Page0763"/>
                <p>LORD: The answer is that this question was always in our mind. It was clear that
                    he was going to hang around for some time. This is a classic example, not only
                    in Indonesia but elsewhere in the world, of working with someone who has done a
                    lot of good economically for his country but runs into other problems. There has
                    been a dramatic rise in standards of living and the quality of life for
                    Indonesians. However, Suharto was also authoritarian in outlook, although he
                    clearly was not in the most nefarious class of people who were really
                    distasteful. He was somewhat in the same class as Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore,
                    although a little less attractive in many respects. There was the specific East
                    Timor case, problems of human rights, and the repression of opposition
                    groups.</p>
                <p>Many observers of the Indonesian scene were well aware of widespread corruption.
                    Looking back on that period and what has happened since then, there isn't much
                    that an outside country can do to promote the succession to a ruler long
                    established in power. This gets to be a very sensitive issue. We raised the
                    human rights question, we raised the East Timor issue. As far as I can recall,
                    corruption was never directly addressed with the Indonesian leaders. That,
                    again, is a tricky issue, although it was expressed as a concern at economic
                    gatherings.So, on the one hand we recognized that Suharto had done a great deal
                    for the country. On the other hand, there were some concerns about what would
                    happen after him. However, to be fair about it, no one predicted the swift
                    collapse of the Suharto regime and the economic difficulties suffered by
                    Indonesia, to the extent that they did occur, after I left office. This is true
                    of many Asian countries.</p>
                <p>Q: There is an economic component in your bureau. I was wondering whether anyone
                    was saying: “Look at these investments. They seem to be overly exuberant.”</p>
                <p>LORD: This was a problem which we discovered after I left office. To be fair
                    about it, the answer is: “No.” There were not a lot of people running around and
                    saying that there was too much investment going into Indonesia or that the
                    bubble was going to burst. Again, this problem was not confined to
                    Indonesia.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of concern about corruption. Of course, American business people
                    didn't participate in that because of our own laws. They should be grateful that
                    they don't have to consider the question of whether to get into that twilight
                    zone because they could get into trouble with U.S. legislation. Therefore,
                    American businessmen are clean. They sometimes lose business, but this makes it
                    easier, in a way, to make decisions. Corruption was very much a problem. On the
                    other hand there is no question that the economy had improved for the people, as
                    a whole. I don't recall anyone who questioned the fundamental strengths of the
                    Indonesian economy, to be honest about it.</p>
                <p>Q: In Congress was there anyone who was particularly interested in the question
                    of East Timor? Usually, when there is a problem, there is a Senator or
                    Congressperson who sort of focuses on that.</p>
                <pb facs="0764" n="Page0764"/>
                <p>LORD: There were several, although with my advancing age I'm having trouble
                    pulling their names out of the hat. There were several in both the Senate and
                    the House of Representatives. Generally, these critics of Indonesia, such as
                    Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi [Democrat, California] and others in the House of
                    Representatives expressed concern about human rights in Indonesia. As I recall,
                    Senator Feingold [Democrat, Wisconsin] was very interested in Indonesia,
                    although I'd have to refresh my memory in this regard. Indonesia would come up
                    in Congressional hearings, whenever there was a discussion of ASEAN or Southeast
                    Asia or a more general view of our Asian policy.</p>
                <p>In talks with either the House of Representatives or Senate Sub-Committees these
                    issues would come up. Even friends of Indonesia would urge greater attention to
                    human rights matters. However, like all issues, the emphasis would depend on the
                    political orientation of the Senator or Congressman or Congresswoman. Those
                    worried about economics or security concerns might touch lightly on East Timor
                    or human rights, whereas others who were very concerned about democracy and
                    human rights would emphasize that more.</p>
                <p>In a discussion with Congress or the representatives of human rights groups you
                    couldn't escape a discussion of allegations of Indonesian repression and the
                    situations in East Timor and Aceh [North Sumatra] and Irian Jaya. I'll talk
                    about this later, but I met with human rights groups and business groups
                    regularly. I would meet with individual players on the Indonesian question, like
                    a bishop in New York who were very concerned about it, as well as human rights
                    activists.</p>
                <p>Whenever I went to Indonesia, both at my level and also when Secretary of State
                    Christopher went there, we met with the Indonesian Human Rights Commission,
                    which actually was set up by the Indonesian Government. This might make the
                    commission a little suspect. However, it was relatively independent and, to this
                    day, is playing a role which is independent of the Indonesian Government,
                    although they have to tread a somewhat careful line. We made it a practice in
                    our bilateral meetings with Indonesian officials, to raise the questions of
                    human rights and East Timor. We would also meet with the Human Rights Commission
                    and get their views on what was happening and show symbolic support for them.
                    Indeed, some U.S. AID money went for the purpose of promoting human rights in
                    Indonesia.</p>
                <p>Also, the Indonesian press was quite mixed. We're not talking about a country
                    that is anywhere near as repressive, of course, as places like Burma, Vietnam,
                    or China. However, Indonesia was somewhat worse than a country like Singapore
                    and nowhere near the democracies of Asia.</p>
                <pb facs="0765" n="Page0765"/>
                <p>I think that Indonesia presented the classic balancing act that we have to carry
                    out in foreign policy in terms of weighing various interests. We have really
                    major economic, security, and diplomatic interests to be weighed against
                    Indonesian human rights policies. We got criticism from both sides. Some
                    observers, including geopoliticians and the supporters of realpolitik, feel that
                    we should stop nagging Indonesia so much on East Timor and human rights, given
                    all of the other interests we have in that country. On the other hand human
                    rights groups and others often expressed the feeling we tended not to press
                    these issues hard enough.</p>
                <p>The fact is that we pushed the East Timor and human rights issues more than any
                    other country did. I attended three or four meetings between President Clinton
                    and President Suharto. It sometimes happened that President Clinton would have a
                    smaller meeting on these sensitive issues. The two Presidents would go off with,
                    perhaps, one additional person each and raise it there. I must say that each
                    time that President Clinton raised these issues with Suharto, he got a pretty
                    stiff answer. The answer was either brief or it was a recitation of history. In
                    the case of East Timor Suharto would say that the Indonesians had lifted the
                    Timorese people out of poverty under Portugal and had given them a great new
                    life. So there wasn't much progress made. However, President Clinton made it
                    clear that, by raising these issues, we tended to set a limit on the scope of
                    our relations.</p>
                <p>On the whole, I would argue, we struck a fairly good balance, given Indonesia's
                    great importance. We spent quite a bit of time on these sensitive issues. We
                    also developed further the overall relationship. There were some individuals in
                    Congress who felt that we should have been much tougher, but I think that there
                    was a general recognition that there was a “balancing act” to be performed,
                    given our huge stakes in Indonesia. I think that we struck this balance about
                    right. I never felt that we were under severe pressure on these issues or that
                    we had not been tough enough. President Clinton devoted quite a bit of time to
                    this relationship with Indonesia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: Not really, no, because Islam in Indonesia is a moderate religion. There
                    wasn't much in the history of Islam in Indonesia or in Islamic movements there
                    which would lend themselves to Islamic extremism. On at least one occasion I met
                    with one of the Muslim leaders in Indonesia, who was of the generally moderate
                    stripe. I think that there was a feeling that this was not a major problem.
                    Considering the impact of Muslim fundamentalism worldwide, there is always a
                    concern that it might spread. We never saw much evidence of that. Even to this
                    day, I don't think that there is much Muslim fundamentalism in Indonesia.</p>

                <p>LORD: That was more of a problem in Malaysia than in Indonesia, although there
                    was some problem in Indonesia, as well. In all candor, this wasn't a major issue
                    which we raised with Indonesia. We would raise the environmental issues
                    generally at ASEAN meetings. However, environmental issues were not of major
                    significance at the bilateral level.</p>
                <p>Q: Were there any passenger or shipping problems with Indonesia?</p>
                <p>LORD: No. I mentioned Ali Alatas, the Foreign Minister, who was one of the most
                    impressive foreign ministers in Asia. He was also one of the longest serving
                    foreign ministers. He survived many political twists and turns. Even to this day
                    he is still working for President Habibie in the post to which President Suharto
                    originally appointed him. He is a very dynamic force, particularly on the
                    Cambodian situation, but also on many other issues.</p>
                <p>He often projected a rather moderate image. I was never quite sure whether he was
                    playing the good cop. He was always loyal to Suharto. I always had the feeling
                    that he was suggesting to me that he was trying to work on Suharto and people in
                    the Indonesian military to be more forthcoming on East Timor and human rights
                    issues. You could have very thoughtful discussions with Ali Alatas. He would try
                    to be reasonable. He had considerable vision and you felt that he was working on
                    these human rights problems in a constructive fashion. He was well disposed to
                    the United States. Along with Foreign Minister Evans of Australia, he was one of
                    the most impressive foreign ministers I dealt with in the region.</p>
                <p>Q: Did we see any influence by the United States on the younger generation in
                    Indonesia, such as Indonesians going to the United States for education, whether
                    technical or otherwise, and then returning to Indonesia?</p>
                <p>LORD: There was some of this, but nowhere near the scale of Malaysia, believe it
                    or not. For some reason our exchange program with Malaysia has always been one
                    of our most expansive programs. It is one of the three or four largest exchange
                    programs, after the Chinese and Taiwan programs.</p>
                <p>I believe that a lot of Indonesian economists were trained in thUnited States and
                    then returned to Indonesia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: Not that I was aware of. We might as well continue. As I gover my notes,
                    some other points might come up.</p>
                <pb facs="0767" n="Page0767"/>
                <p>Thailand, of course, is an ally under the SEATO [Southeast Asian Treaty
                    Organization] treaty. We have large economic interests in Thailand and,
                    basically, a very positive relationship. Our biggest problems with Thailand
                    during the period when I was Assistant Secretary concerned the Khmer Rouge
                    [Cambodian communists] and the drug problem. As the four years of my term went
                    on, conditions improved on both fronts, even as Thailand and the United States
                    cooperated in many other areas.</p>
                <p>Elements of the Thai military had always had a cozy relationship with the Khmer
                    Rouge along the Thai-Cambodian border in terms of logging and other enterprises.
                    For years the Thai Government would say that it was trying to crack down on this
                    cooperation with the Khmer Rouge. They would let the Khmer Rouge come over the
                    border into Thailand if they were pursued by the Phnom Penh Government forces.
                    We thought that it was crucial to get Thailand to crack down on the Khmer Rouge
                    if there was going to be peace in Cambodia. In fact, it was essential to deal
                    with the terrible Khmer Rouge threat and to bring an end to the genocide carried
                    out by the Pol Pot Government in Cambodia. We thought that if we could really
                    get Thai cooperation, on top of assistance or acquiescence from the Chinese
                    Government, which had been the other, major backer of the Khmer Rouge over the
                    years, this would reduce that threat.</p>
                <p>It was a constant battle with the Thai on this issue. They would say: “Yes, we'll
                    do whatever we can.” They said that some of the local Thai military leaders
                    along the Thai-Cambodian border wouldn't cooperate. That wasn't good enough for
                    us. So we leaned very heavily on the Thai. As time went on, they gradually
                    tightened up on the Khmer Rouge, partly because of our pressuring them. Also,
                    other countries joined in pressuring them. Partly also, because I think that the
                    Thai are very good at knowing which way the wind blows. They've always been very
                    good at sniffing out trends. They were the one Southeast Asian country that
                    wasn't colonized by Europe, and they have maintained their independence. I think
                    that they saw the balance of forces shifting against the Khmer Rouge. This
                    helped to influence them to be tougher with the Khmer Rouge.</p>
                <p>As you will recall, in the wake of the Vietnam War there was the classic problem
                    of the Khmer Rouge taking over and establishing a brutal regime in Cambodia.
                    We'll get back to Cambodia later. Part of the problem was further exacerbated by
                    the participation and influence of other, outside countries. On the one hand
                    there was China, with its historic animosity toward and problems with Vietnam.
                    This was ironic because we saw China as a patron of Vietnam during the Vietnam
                    War. We underestimated the actual tensions between China and Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0768" n="Page0768"/>
                <p>China essentially backed the Khmer Rouge, apparently thinking that a Khmer Rouge
                    - dominated Cambodia would be a kind of buffer between Vietnam and China, or
                    that a Chinese-influenced Cambodia would put more pressure on the Vietnamese. As
                    you recall, Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1979 and installed a government
                    essentially dominated by the Vietnamese. China was always involved in trying to
                    weaken that government. The Chinese don't worry about things like genocide and
                    human rights. Anyway, they didn't have to hold their noses very much when they
                    were working with the Khmer Rouge.</p>
                <p>On the other hand the Vietnamese, of course, wanted to see a friendly government
                    in Cambodia. In fact, the Hun Sen Government in Cambodia was disposed in a
                    friendly way toward the Hanoi Government.</p>
                <p>Then there were the Thai working with the Khmer Rouge for the reasons I have
                    mentioned. The Thai have some historical tensions with Vietnam as well, of
                    course. The Thai were allied with us against North Vietnam during the Vietnam
                    War.</p>
                <p>There were also residual French interests and a residual U.S. role iThailand.</p>
                <p>The Cambodian conflict was complicated by these outside powers, all of which gets
                    me back to Thailand and our leaning on them. Gradually, the Chinese became more
                    even handed. They cut back and then cut off aid to the Khmer Rouge. The Thai
                    began to crack down more effectively along the Thai-Cambodian border. All of
                    this helped to weaken the Khmer Rouge. As we speak now the Khmer Rouge are just
                    about finished as an effective force in Cambodia. In many ways Cambodia is a
                    tragic country. At least they no longer have the threat from the Khmer
                    Rouge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time that you were Assistant Secretary were we
                        workinon China to “withdraw its support” from the Khmer Rouge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Absolutely. They would never acknowledge directly to us that they were
                    doing what we wanted. They didn't do it primarily for our purposes. Again, they
                    did it because they saw that Hun Sen and his forces were in the ascendancy. The
                    Chinese knew that they were paying a price for their blatant support of the
                    Khmer Rouge, in terms of international opinion, which isn't as important to them
                    as geopolitics and the balance of power. Anyway, as the Khmer Rouge began to
                    grow weaker, the Chinese began to see that maybe they could have more influence
                    in Southeast Asia by displaying less support of the Khmer Rouge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cambodia received support from China.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0769" n="Page0769"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes, but, given China's historic problems with Vietnam, anything that makes
                    Vietnam nervous helps China with their Vietnam problem. Again, we would raise
                    this matter with the Chinese, appealing to their own interest and influence in
                    the region. With the Chinese you don't get very far by invoking the human rights
                    dimension and by talking about the terrible genocide. You have to cite practical
                    reasons, including their desire to have better relations with Southeast Asia and
                    their general interest in having more stability in that region.</p>
                <p>In any event, returning to Thailand, we really raised the Cambodian issue in
                    almost every meeting with the Thai, because it was very crucial to us. As I
                    said, the Thai became more and more helpful, to the point that, during the last
                    couple of years of my service as Assistant Secretary, I think that it's fair to
                    say that we were pretty satisfied with what the Thai were doing. We would check
                    out what the Thai were doing through our intelligence reports. We had a pretty
                    good reading as to whether the Thai were reining in their people. It reached the
                    point where, not only did the Khmer Rouge no longer count on Thai aid or even
                    Thai asylum but sometimes they would be turned back from the Thai-Cambodian
                    border. So working with the Thai became another way of weakening the Khmer
                    Rouge.</p>
                <p>The other problem with Thailand was illicit drugs. The Thai became more and more
                    cooperative on the drug problem, which had been a major issue for us. So we made
                    progress with that. I cite those two problems as being typical issues we dealt
                    with in Thailand, along with intellectual property rights. We made some progress
                    on that issue, as well.</p>
                <p>Thus, we had some difficulties with Thailand, but we had a very good security
                    relationship with them. Thailand was our most important Southeast Asian security
                    partner. We had our second largest military exercise in East Asia with Thailand,
                    after another major exercise in South Korea. There have been numerous exchange
                    programs and exercises, and we have had access to Royal Thai facilities.</p>
                <p>We had one disappointment in 1993 or 1994. We tentatively approached the Thai to
                    see if we could preposition some supplies offshore, in Thai waters, for possible
                    future contingency use. This would have consisted of materiel and equipment
                    which we could get to quickly, not only for Southeast Asian contingencies but
                    also those involving the Middle East. We didn't handle this issue very well,
                    diplomatically. We didn't prepare the ground well, news of it leaked, and it got
                    caught up in Thai domestic politics. Thailand never really turned the proposal
                    down, but it put it off indefinitely. This was somewhat irritating, since
                    Thailand is an ally, and we thought that, given their cooperation in so many
                    other areas, we would obtain their approval. Instead, the issue got tangled up
                    in Thai domestic politics, since it looked as if Thailand would become involved
                    in regional conflicts if it agreed to pre-position U.S. military supplies in
                    Thailand. The U.S. JCS [Joint Chiefs of Staff] finally decided a year or two
                    later that we really didn't need this equipment storage facility. That was one
                    example where, on the military side, we did not have full cooperation from the
                    Thai. This was an exception to the rule of broad cooperation from the Thai.</p>

                <p>I visited Bangkok on many occasions and talked to them often aregional and UN
                    meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Thai Government during the
                        timyou were Assistant Secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: They were constantly forming and dissolving coalitions. You wondered
                    whether the Thai military were going to get back into the political game. The
                    Thai Governments certainly didn't strike us as particularly strong. Often, they
                    had to maneuver because they were coalitions. However, on the whole they were
                    friendly to the U.S. and sort of muddled through their problems but they were
                    still doing all right. I don't have a strong feeling that the Thai Governments
                    were particularly weak. Certainly, they were not hostile to the U.S. Thailand
                    didn't have particularly dynamic leaders but they were friendly to us on the
                    whole.</p>
                <p>When you think of Singapore, you think of Lee Kuan Yew. When you think of
                    Malaysia, you think of Mahathir Mohammed. When you think of the Philippines, you
                    think of Marcos as a past leader but also of Fidel Ramos. In Thailand the
                    leaders were more low key, low profile. They reminded me of Japan, at least in
                    the sense that they did not have particularly strong leaders.</p>
                <p>However, the good news was that Thailand was not authoritarian. It was a
                    democracy. Democracies, of course, can be sloppier, and their leaders may be
                    less dynamic and dominant. You can't have it both ways. On the whole, we had a
                    very solid, friendly relationship with Thailand during this period. There were
                    really no major problems, beyond the ones I've mentioned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were refugees from Burma and Cambodia an issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: They were an issue, but the Thai were generally helpful. At times, in terms
                    of the refugees from Burma, the Thai would be worried about their relations with
                    Burma. We sometimes felt that the Thai could have been a little bit more
                    sensitive to refugee needs. However, on the whole, the Thai had a very good
                    record on refugees. Whether it concerned refugees from Vietnam, Burma, or
                    Cambodia, the Thai had a record of taking them in. They tried to support them
                    financially, as did the UN and others. On the whole the Thai deserved high
                    remarks for their treatment of refugees.</p>
                <p>I think that those are the major themes affecting Thailand during this period. On
                    the whole the Thai record was pretty positive, and our relations with Thailand
                    were pretty problem free, particularly as we made progress in dealing with the
                    Khmer Rouge, drugs, and intellectual property rights.</p>
                <pb facs="0771" n="Page0771"/>
                <p>Now the Philippines, particularly during the first couple of years of the
                    1993-1997 period, was lagging behind the rest of its neighbors, on the whole, in
                    terms of economic growth and dynamism. A lot of this ironically turned out to be
                    a plus for the Philippines at the time because during this period they had to
                    undertake a lot of reforms in order to get IMF [International Monetary Fund]
                    assistance.</p>
                <p>So the Philippines undertook a lot of reforms and restructuring that the IMF
                    imposed. As a result, they streamlined and worked hard on their economy. There
                    was a great movement toward democracy. They got rid of President Marcos and, at
                    first got Mrs. Aquino as President. She was a good democrat but not that
                    effective on the economic front. Then they had Fidel Ramos as their principal
                    leader and ultimately President. I think that he was one of the most impressive
                    leaders in the world during this period.</p>
                <p>During this period before he was elected President of the Philippines Ramos
                    effectively protected Mrs. Aquino against military coups d'etat and threats to
                    democracy. When he became President, he launched an economic reform program
                    which, together with what the Philippines had been doing with the IMF, really
                    got the country into a position for economic take off. As a result, by the time
                    he left office, the Philippines had done very well economically for a couple of
                    years. It attracted a lot of foreign investment which it previously had been
                    unable to obtain. It consolidated its democracy and was catching up with the
                    rest of Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>Because the Philippines had just gone through a tough restructuring period and
                    was quite open, democratic, and transparent, it has survived the Asian financial
                    crisis which has occurred since I left office much better than its neighbors.
                    Now, it's been hit by an economic recession like everyone else, but it's still
                    growing, although very moderately now. Instead of the contraction and disaster
                    that happened in Indonesia.</p>

                        wheyou were in office as Assistant Secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I think that it was two years before. Then we had reconstituted low-key
                    military cooperation. We had ship visits and some joint military exercises with
                    the Philippines. President Fidel Ramos was very friendly, but there were still
                    some people on the U.S. side who were bitter about our withdrawal from the bases
                    in the Philippines.</p>
                <pb facs="0772" n="Page0772"/>
                <p>In a way I think that our withdrawal from these bases was a healthy development.
                    I yield to no one in my support for a base presence in the Philippines. The
                    bases were crucial for the U.S. forward presence, stability, and so on. However,
                    there was no question that when we had large, land-based facilities like that,
                    they were always subject to political problems at one point or another. In
                    addition to economic benefits for the local population, we ran up against the
                    irritations which the presence or intrusion of U.S. forces always creates. We
                    had seen this happen in Japan and elsewhere. We obviously didn't want to leave
                    the Philippines, because of the tremendous, strategic value of our bases there.
                    However, we were forced to leave by the political winds that began to blow. In a
                    way I think that this was a healthy adjustment. Now, during the period when I
                    was Assistant Secretary, we talked about gaining access to base facilities in
                    the Philippines and ad hoc arrangements, rather than permanent bases in the
                    Philippines, which were subject to political pressures.</p>
                <p>As I say, each of the countries of Southeast Asia, almost without exception, has
                    stepped up to help compensate for our withdrawal from the Philippines. Whether
                    the country involved is Thailand, Malaysia, or even Brunei or Singapore, there
                    are military exchanges and joint exercises, access to ship repair facilities,
                    and so on. The Philippines was doing this to a modest degree. We had to work out
                    a new arrangement, since we no longer had a SOFA or Status of Forces Agreement,
                    to cover our military personnel who went to the Philippines temporarily for
                    exercises or for other reasons. This was a problem which came up late in my term
                    as Assistant Secretary and has been resolved since I was there. We had to make
                    some ad hoc arrangements, and this constrained our military cooperation to a
                    certain extent.However, on the whole our relations with the Philippines were
                    very positive throughout this period. As I said, Ramos deserves great credit for
                    his contributions to democracy and protecting newly won democracy, since Marcos
                    left office. Then there were the tremendous, economic reforms, the boosting of
                    the Philippine economy, and Ramos' continued promotion of democratic principles.
                    He was one of the most effective world leaders during this period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we able to use any of the facilities for temporary
                        shirepairs at Subic Bay in the Philippines, and all of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0773" n="Page0773"/>
                <p>LORD: Subic Bay was turned very successfully into an Economic Investment Region.
                    I visited there during one of my visits to the Philippines. I went to the
                    Philippines several times on my own, as well as with the President, who attended
                    the APEC Summit Meeting in Manila in 1996, and with Secretary of State
                    Christopher on other occasions. I also went to the Philippines with Secretary of
                    Defense Perry and the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, when there was a
                    commemoration of the defense of Corregidor in 1941-1942. I think that in terms
                    of the American forces actually committed, when we retook the Philippines with
                    MacArthur, the numbers of troops involved were even larger than our troop
                    strength in Normandy. I may have the numbers screwed up, but the forces involved
                    in the operation were on a major scale. Of course, this operation didn't have
                    the publicity or the resonance in history and cannot be considered as important
                    as the liberation of Europe was. In any case, that was a major
                    commemoration.</p>
                <p>Along with Thailand, the Philippines has been a positive force in this whole
                    debate about Asian values, which we'll get to later. Thailand and the
                    Philippines are democracies. Of course, it is important that they make economic
                    progress, to show that democracy and economic progress go hand in hand. You
                    don't have to have authoritarian governments to make progress in terms of their
                    standard of living, and so on. So, therefore, the rise of the Philippines was
                    very encouraging in that respect as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting that there has been tremendous
                        immigration from the Philippines to the United States, over the years.
                        However, in my perusal of the newspapers and so forth, there doesn't seem to
                        be much of a Philippine lobby here in Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I've noticed that as well. I think that this is true of thAsian lobby in
                    general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can hardly believe that in time the South Koreans won't
                        have lobby of their own.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: You're absolutely right. It's true of the Philippines and it's generally
                    true of Asian immigrants in the U.S. They've done very well, of course. They
                    have this sense of entrepreneurship, academic excellence, and family values. So
                    whether it's their good behavior in terms of avoidance of crime or whether it's
                    being at the head of a class, whether they are Vietnamese, Japanese, or
                    whatever, or whether it's their success economically, they have added greatly to
                    our society. One of the reasons we wanted to stress the Pacific Community
                    generally in our foreign policy is the growing importance of Asians in our
                    society.</p>
                <p>However, they haven't been active politically. This is partly due to their style
                    and partly because they've done well and maybe they don't have to press on it.
                    This doesn't mean that all Asians have done well. Some of them have done better
                    than others. This may be changing somewhat, even as we speak. There may be more
                    lobbying by Asian-Americans in the future.</p>
                <pb facs="0774" n="Page0774"/>
                <p>I was going to mention Taiwan, but that's something that has been done by the
                    Taiwan authorities. It's not due to the Chinese or Taiwanese in this country. It
                    is an interesting phenomenon. You're absolutely right.</p>
                <p>There is one issue of more benefits for Philippine veterans which is still
                    outstanding as we speak.We might move on to Malaysia, which is another classic
                    example of balancing off interests as it is in Indonesia. This applies to
                    Malaysia particularly, of course, because of the personality of Prime Minister
                    Mahathir, who has raised the whole issue of Asian values and so on. He has been
                    the most outspoken anti-Western person in his rhetoric. He has been a great
                    proponent of Asian values and has been critical of what he has called the
                    “decadence” of the West. He defines this as consisting of too much liberty. At
                    times he has exhibited a certain racist dimension, both in his general attack on
                    white men in general in his excluding Australia and New Zealand from “Asian”
                    groupings, and his anti- Jewish remarks at times, including comments he made
                    during a recent crisis since I left office as Assistant Secretary. He has
                    attacked George Soros and others, probably because they are Jewish. He is a very
                    unpleasant, nasty person. However, he is obviously very intelligent. We won't
                    get into current events, but he is under some pressure now, as we speak, for
                    mistakes he has made. There is no question that he did a terrific job in lifting
                    the Malaysian economy, notwithstanding the crises which have occurred since I
                    left office.</p>
                <p>I know that when Secretary of State Christopher went to Malaysia and was driving
                    into Kuala Lumpur from the airport, he was struck by the signs of dynamism and
                    construction going on. Not all of this is an illusion. Asia has not gone from
                    miracle to meltdown, and Malaysia hasn't, either. There has been tremendous
                    growth, the standard of living has risen, investment has been attracted, and
                    there has been a notable effort to turn Malaysia into being a technological
                    leader. Prime Minister Mahathir has tried to build a Malaysian version of
                    Silicon Valley and attract high tech investment. There is a lot of construction
                    going on in Malaysia. The world's tallest building has been constructed there.
                    Some of this has turned out to be overexuberant, as we have seen since then.
                    However, it has not all been illusions. There is no question that under
                    Mahathir's leadership Malaysia has improved very much economically. He has a
                    dynamic program, looking toward the year 2020. All of this has suffered somewhat
                    as a result of the Asian financial crisis since then.So, on the one hand, we had
                    growing economic interests in Malaysia. The Malaysian Government was cooperative
                    on the security front, in terms of access and joint exercises. Malaysia is a
                    member of the Five Power defense arrangement. It doesn't include us, but it is
                    composed of Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.
                    Malaysia was generally helpful on the Cambodian issue, in which it has
                    considerable interest. Of course, Malaysia is a member of ASEAN.</p>
                <pb facs="0775" n="Page0775"/>
                <p>For all of these reasons there were some positive elements in our relations with
                    Malaysia, as well as some great irritations with Prime Minister Mahathir
                    personally, at times, especially his attacks on the U.S., the West, and our
                    values. In terms of human rights Malaysia was certainly better off than the
                    worst parts of Asia and probably better than Indonesia. However, it was not a
                    democracy like Thailand, enjoying full freedom. There was a mixed picture on
                    that front. I don't think that you could accuse Mahathir of the excesses of
                    Suharto and other major figures in Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you meet Mahathir?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. I had at least one meeting alone with him when I visited Malaysia in
                    my own right. I sat in on meetings between Secretary Christopher, President
                    Clinton, and Mahathir. I saw him in the White House.</p>
                <p>I should add that Mahathir wasn't totally hostile at all times. He could turn on
                    the charm, but you never forgot that he held these views of suspicion of the
                    West, even as he wanted Western investment. I will also say that he supported
                    the U.S. military presence as being in the interests of Malaysia and Southeast
                    Asia for stability. He still has some residual concerns about China or Japan and
                    so he sees the U.S. as a balancing force. Even then, he was somewhat more
                    ambivalent toward us than, say, Singapore, the Philippines, or Thailand.</p>
                <p>One thing that always amazed me was the contrast between Mahathir and his deputy,
                    Anwar Ibrahim. Again, we won't get into current events, since Anwar Ibrahim is
                    in prison and this has led the unrest in Malaysia. Even as Mahathir was going
                    around, promoting Asian values, attacking the West, and denigrating human
                    rights, Ibrahim has been just the opposite. In a number of speeches that I made
                    I would quote Ibrahim. First, he was eloquent, and, secondly, because he was
                    Mahathir's deputy. This was to make my point that “Asian values” is a phony term
                    because who speaks for Asia? Of course, I would cite all of the democracies in
                    Asia and the fact that people believe in democracy, whether this involves Japan
                    or Taiwan. Taiwan shows that, even on Chinese soil, you can have democracy. Or
                    the Republic of Korea, with the help of Kim Dae Jung and others, or Thailand,
                    the Philippines, and even in Cambodia, where the people wanted to vote, or in
                    Mongolia, where the people threw off the Soviet and communist yoke and enjoyed
                    free elections.</p>
                <p>I would point to all of the democratic forces in Asia and add that one shouldn't
                    just listen to people like Lee Kuan Yew and Mahathir, let alone Jiang Zemin of
                    China, or the Vietnamese or North Korean leaders. It's a mixed picture. We'll
                    get back to that subject again. In my speeches I would also quote Anwar Ibrahim,
                    specifically, to ask, even in Malaysia, “Who speaks for Asian values?” I could
                    never understand why Mahathir tolerated such a contrast in philosophy and
                    rhetoric in his own government. He, himself, said on one occasion: “Anwar
                    Ibrahim will take over from me some day,” although that day seems to keep
                    receding into the future.</p>
                <pb facs="0776" n="Page0776"/>
                <p>Also, even on economic issues, and that has become more dramatic with the
                    emergence of the Asian financial crisis, Ibrahim was even more open to
                    transparency and outside investment than Mahathir. So Mahathir and Ibrahim were
                    always an odd couple. We've seen just how odd they were in recent months, when
                    Mahathir has arranged to have Anwar Ibrahim arrested and imprisoned.</p>
                <p>Q: But you were saying that Malaysia had one of the largest groups of students
                    going to the United States and then coming back when their studies were
                    completed. Did this seem to foster better ties between Malaysia and the United
                    States, at least in terms of business and so forth?</p>
                <p>LORD: It has in all of these countries. It's been one of the great assets of
                    American foreign policy around the world, and not just in Asia. I still think
                    that this is going to have an impact on our relations with that area of the
                    world and in Malaysia, in particular, in the future. I can't quantify the number
                    of Malaysian students in the United States. I want to stress that, despite the
                    prickliness of Mahathir, the Malaysian students who have studied in the U.S. are
                    really quite positive about their experience in this country.</p>
                <p>We didn't have such glaring issues outstanding between Malaysia and the United
                    States as East Timor or a huge human rights crackdown. It was clear that there
                    was some evidence of corruption in Malaysia, but it wasn't as blatant as it was
                    in Indonesia. We also had good cooperation in the economic and military field.
                    So our bilateral relationship really reflected quite strong ties between our two
                    countries.</p>
                <p>The problem came up in broader discussions of values, as I've already mentioned.
                    Then there was the particular issues of the East Asian Economic Caucus. Mahathir
                    had the idea of forming an Asian-only grouping, partly to give Asia more clout
                    and partly to balance off U.S. and Western influence. Mahathir already had ASEAN
                    as a group, but he wanted to include Japan, China, and others to form a caucus
                    which would take collective positions. This idea had been simmering for several
                    years, before we even entered office. Former Secretary of State Jim Baker had
                    taken on Mahathir directly and frontally because we didn't want to see an
                    Asian-only group which might exclude the U.S. Because of this idea there had
                    been some tensions between Mahathir and the Administration of President
                    Bush.</p>
                <p>However, by happenstance or somewhat by accident, to be honest about it, I at
                    least temporarily became an instant hero with Mahathir when I first came into
                    office, because of a comment that I made during my confirmation hearings.</p>
                <pb facs="0777" n="Page0777"/>
                <p>I've got to get more details and see exactly what the Senators had in mind with
                    their question and what Mahathir had in mind on my response. I certainly didn't
                    give him any encouragement on EAEC. However, instead of being instantly hostile,
                    in effect I said that I wanted to hear more about it. Frankly, I didn't ascribe
                    much importance to the answer which I gave to a question at my hearings before
                    the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. This comment was immediately played up
                    in the Malaysian press as a more forthcoming, constructive, fair-minded attitude
                    by the new American administration compared to Baker's frontal opposition. This
                    was almost an honor that I almost didn't want to receive.</p>
                <p>In fact, I helped to shape a policy over the coming years which, I think, was
                    quite effective on how we dealt with this issue. On the surface, it's pretty
                    hard to make the point, at least superficially, that the Asians should not talk
                    among themselves. In other words, why does the U.S. always have to be present
                    for discussions?</p>
                <p>One reason that we promoted APEC, regional security dialogues, regional
                    institutions, and the whole Pacific Community concept, as I said earlier, was to
                    have trans-Pacific organizations and approaches, and not Asian-only ones. That
                    would anchor us there and get us at the bargaining table from the beginning. But
                    the fact is that it is pretty hard to make the case that it is somehow against
                    the law for Asian countries to get together without our being present. It's okay
                    for the Europeans to do this, even though we are also a transatlantic nation,
                    too. So at least superficially it was a little difficult to do this for
                    Asia.</p>
                <p>Having said that, what we didn't want was to have not only ASEAN but Japan,
                    China, and South Korea as well get together and decide on positions before we
                    had a crack at them. Then we would have had to face a united front, although it
                    would be difficult for these countries to do this because of their varying
                    approaches and ideology. Nevertheless, we just didn't want to be excluded. Then,
                    when we got to some issues, we might find that with the EAEC [East Asian
                    Economic Community] we couldn't develop too much influence because the EAEC
                    would say: “Well, we're still trying to develop the EAEC position.” Then, when
                    they had prepared this position, they might say that they couldn't change it,
                    because this was a collective position. We didn't want to get caught on that
                    kind of “Catch-22” deal.</p>
                <p>So we didn't like the EAEC concept, but we just avoided taking them on frontally.
                    We dragged this process out, slowed it down, and deprived it of meaning as best
                    we could. We delayed and stalled. Meanwhile, there were specific institutions
                    like APEC and the regional security dialogues we were developing, which would
                    anchor us in Asia and make us indispensable. We would try to let this process of
                    development of the EAEC die a slow death, or at least deprive it of any real
                    meaning. Meanwhile, we would work behind the scenes, with Japan in particular,
                    and try to make the case in Asian debates that the U.S. shouldn't be excluded.
                    However, the Japanese had to be careful not to look like puppets of the United
                    States. We were sensitive to that concern.</p>
                <pb facs="0778" n="Page0778"/>
                <p>I think that it's fair to say that we dragged this process out over several
                    years. Finally the Asian countries would get together for breakfast before an
                    APEC meeting or a regional security dialogue meeting. We could live with that.
                    At these meetings Japan and South Korea, in particular, would make sure that no
                    decisions were made which would exclude the U.S. So we would work with them
                    before these meetings to make sure that things would not come out badly. In
                    effect, we adopted a relaxed attitude, when there were some of these meetings,
                    which were called usually at the initiative of Prime Minister Mahathir. So this
                    process never really amounted to anything. There never was a major bloc
                    established. Mahathir had to keep redefining it himself, saying that he wasn't
                    trying to exclude the U.S. from Asia. This was just a chance for Asians to talk
                    among themselves.</p>
                <p>I think that our less frontal approach lowered tensions with Mahathir on this
                    issue. He may have been frustrated at our tactics but he couldn't say that we
                    were totally hostile. Meanwhile, we beefed up APEC with President Clinton
                    raising it to a summit level. We endorsed these regional security dialogues. We
                    got ourselves anchored more and more in these Pacific-wide institutions. So the
                    EAEC never became a major problem. I think that we handled this issue quite
                    skillfully. We couldn't solve the problem overnight for many reasons. It was
                    hard frontally to approach Asian caucusing, but we also didn't want them to
                    threaten our interests.</p>
                <p>Toward the end of my term as Assistant Secretary and since then, the point has
                    been reached where there developed Asian-European dialogues which would include
                    ASEAN, Japan, South Korea, and China on the Asian side and the Europeans on the
                    other side. However, by then we had become more relaxed about this. Again, as
                    you look at Europe, Asia, and the U.S., clearly the Asian-European dialogue was
                    and is the weakest. They had the right to talk to each other, even as we had our
                    own ties across the Atlantic and the Pacific. So this is a way of saying that
                    the EAEC issue was a fairly significant irritant and problem as we came into
                    office, but by our strategy of stretching it out, delaying it, talking to Japan
                    and South Korea, and building up Pacific institutions we handled it well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you talk about Prime Minister Mahathir, one can't help
                        buremember the phrase used to describe him as the Asian De Gaulle.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: It might have come up. It certainly was not a bad analogy, in terms of
                    nationalism and so forth. In fact, I think that this is a pretty good analogy. I
                    think that De Gaulle was for France and its grandeur, even to the point where
                    this had some negative effect on his attitude toward European unity and so on.
                    He wanted France to stand out. Mahathir thought of building up Malaysia,
                    certainly, but also tended to think of himself more as an Asian
                    spokesperson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was working from a much smaller base.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0779" n="Page0779"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes, he was working from a much smaller base.</p>
                <p>Q: Still, we had had the experience of having to deal with this kind of attitude
                    before. As you were working on this problem, were there any voices within our
                    government, within your bureau, or even internally, within yourself, saying:
                    “What are we doing, getting into this Asian question? Maybe we should not be so
                    intrusive in Asia.”</p>
                <p>LORD: There was some debate. It wasn't an emotional debate. It was a matter of
                    degree and emphasis. There were some who felt: “Let them go ahead. It's not
                    going to hurt us.” They didn't feel passionately about it. There were others,
                    including some on the economic side, who were concerned about Asian countries
                    developing a caucus and maybe even, on economic issues, taking stances, let
                    alone on security matters, and so on. That would have been difficult for us to
                    deal with. They may have felt that we ought to deal with this a little more
                    frontally. However, I think that the center of gravity in the U.S. government
                    was pretty much where I described it. We didn't want to embrace an Asian caucus,
                    because it did have some possible dangers over time. But we didn't want it to
                    become a major irritant, not only with Malaysia, but, putting our other friends
                    in Asia, like Japan, Thailand, and the Philippines, in a bind. They didn't want
                    to look as if they were not good Asians or were U.S. puppets, though they
                    themselves didn't want the U.S. to be excluded.</p>
                <p>We thought that it was important to strike a middle ground and try to slow down
                    any momentum developing toward the establishment of an Asian caucus because of
                    the possible exclusion of the U.S. We recognized the principle that they had the
                    right to talk to each other, and we just kind of dragged the process out. So
                    there were some debates, but it was never a major source of tension between
                    agencies of the U.S. Government or even in my own bureau. I think that most
                    people felt that this was about the way to handle it. Occasionally, somebody
                    would speak up and say that we ought to be tougher. Others would say that it
                    wasn't worth worrying about. It was never a major issue within the
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>Singapore is a good example of a place where we had tremendously positive
                    relations on every conceivable front except one. This again was the issue of
                    Asian values and the Singapore Government's treatment of some of its citizens.
                    On the one hand they had the rule of law there, but the government was pretty
                    authoritarian. I needn't elaborate on this. Lee Kuan Yew was now the Senior
                    Minister with Prime Minister Goh, who was the man in charge, although many
                    people felt that Lee Kuan Yew was looking over his shoulder.</p>
                <p>The bad news in Singapore was that there was a caning incident where a young
                    American citizen was punished by caning for something he did. I can't even
                    remember now what it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a kid. He went out and, I think, hit some cars. He
                        disome damage to parked cars.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0780" n="Page0780"/>
                <p>LORD: That's right. This became a major issue with some people in the U.S. Some
                    columnists, such as Bill Safire, and some members of Congress always had it in
                    for Lee Kuan Yew. There were some people in the U.S. who sort of approved of
                    Singapore saying, in effect, that a little discipline is a good idea. If you
                    don't like drugs, you ought to be happy to have Singapore so tough on drugs. If
                    you want clean streets, you ought to be happy that he doesn't let people chew
                    gum, throw it away on the street, and so on. So there was some feeling here, in
                    reaction to alleged permissiveness in U.S. society, that a little caning goes a
                    long way. However, the overwhelming reaction, including that in editorial
                    opinions, was one of considerable outrage.</p>
                <p>We did weigh in on that, out of our concern about it. We appealed to Singapore's
                    self interest in terms of their image in the United States. We didn't get very
                    far with this approach, needless to say. I have to tell you that I personally
                    felt that we shouldn't go overboard on this issue. Singapore had the rule of
                    law. I felt that, on the whole, and compared to many other countries, that it
                    was quite enlightened, although I was annoyed at Lee Kuan Yew's Asian values
                    approach and so on. I also recognized that on almost every other issue Singapore
                    was one of our best friends.</p>
                <p>This was the only concern that we had with Singapore, to be balanced off against
                    very positive relations on almost every other issue. So, first of all, I didn't
                    think that Singapore was that bad on human rights. I didn't like caning either,
                    but I didn't think that this issue should disrupt our entire relationship.
                    Secondly, we had all of these other, positive aspects in the contacts between
                    our two countries.</p>
                <p>In this connection there was one significant glitch where Mickey Kantor, our U.S.
                    Trade Representative, got incensed about the caning, and without checking with
                    any of us, he said that the first meeting of the World Trade Organization, which
                    was being set up to take over from the GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and
                    Trade], should not take place in Singapore because of the caning episode. This
                    was an uncoordinated position which we had to walk back.</p>
                <p>So for a few months the caning issue was one of considerable tension. We also had
                    problems with Singapore where the government was restricting circulation of
                    certain magazines and newspapers. The “International Herald Tribune” was being
                    sued, and some people were subjected to Singapore's libel laws. So there was
                    some irritation.</p>
                <pb facs="0781" n="Page0781"/>
                <p>For these reasons presumably, despite my best efforts, for several years the
                    White House would not approve a meeting in the Oval Office between Prime
                    Minister Goh of Singapore and President Clinton. This was a constant frustration
                    to me, because President Clinton just would not receive Prime Minister Goh in
                    the Oval Office because of domestic political reasons and because of concern
                    about Bill Safire, and others. Once Goh was in the U.S. anyway for some economic
                    conference. Here was an opportunity for the President to see him, without
                    actually inviting him to come to the U.S. He could have a businesslike meeting.
                    I just ranted and raved on this matter because Singapore was a staunch supporter
                    of the U.S. presence in Asia, cooperative on security issues, a free trader,
                    etc. I worked hard on the NSC. Goh had all of these positive aspects. If
                    President Clinton would agree to see Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia in the
                    Oval Office, not to mention President Suharto of Indonesia, why couldn't he see
                    the Prime Minister of Singapore? I had feelings of total frustration. It was a
                    good example where domestic politics in the White House overruled our foreign
                    policy interests.</p>
                <p>The President would see Prime Minister Goh at APEC meetings and would have a
                    bilateral meeting with him there. Usually, there was some controversy over
                    whether it was an official bilateral or not. I thought that the White House was
                    overly sensitive on this issue. I was frustrated with some of the Asian values
                    which the Singapore Government advocated. However, compared to some other
                    countries' human rights performance, and given Singapore's tremendous positive
                    ties with us, I felt that the White House was being ridiculous on this issue of
                    not receiving Prime Minister Goh in the Oval Office. This matter was a constant
                    source of frustration. I'm happy to say that Prime Minister Goh finally got in
                    to see President Clinton in the Oval Office in 1997.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was an example of the political person at the White
                        House...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I would have to say that Tony Lake and Sandy Berger [National Security
                    Advisers] were not prepared to press President Clinton very hard on this issue.
                    I always felt that if we could approach the President directly, that he might be
                    more relaxed. You can never tell on some of these matters. When we get to
                    Vietnam, we'll get to that point as well - that is, there was a question as to
                    how much the NSC was reflecting what they knew the President's predilections
                    were, how much they were just protecting him without consulting him, and how
                    much they were affected by the domestic political advisers in the White House.
                    In this case, for all I know, Mickey Kantor [U.S. Trade Representative], who was
                    very close to the President, might have weighed in on some of these issues. Or
                    perhaps it was the influence of other people who just didn't like what Singapore
                    was up to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On this caning issue a compromise was sort of
                        reached.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0782" n="Page0782"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes. The young man was caned, but they reduced the sentence to a more
                    moderate number of strokes of the rotan, as the saying goes in Singapore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think that the young man received three strokes
                        instead o12.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: So they made an effort to limit the impact of the affair. However, once it
                    got to the point where there was actually a request from the President on the
                    matter, you got into a question of face. This made it impossible for the
                    Singapore Government to back off completely.</p>
                <p>So I spent quite a bit of time on this relationship with Singapore. I met
                    continually with the Singapore Ambassador, who was a very able man named Nathan.
                    I also visited Singapore several times. I tried to work on the positive aspects
                    of this relationship. I kept talking about the positive aspects of this
                    relationship. We had considerable economic interests in Singapore, despite the
                    fact that it's a very small. It's a very dynamic country, of course. Singapore
                    is a regional leader, in many respects, far beyond its size. Its diplomats and
                    bureaucrats - well paid to discourage corruption - are exceptionally
                    able.Singapore was always in the forefront of free trade. It was probably the
                    greatest proponent of free trade and opening up economies in all of Southeast
                    Asia, and perhaps in all of Asia. This was one reason why one of the first
                    meetings of the WTO [World Trade Organization] was held in Singapore. Whenever
                    we had battles with ASEAN on economic issues, Singapore was always on the side
                    of justice and light as far as we were concerned.</p>
                <p>Singapore was the single, strongest proponent of a U.S. military presence in
                    Asia. We had a tremendous military cooperation program in Singapore, including
                    access to their bases. To his credit, Lee Kuan Yew, even though he would tangle
                    with us on Asian values was the most outspoken figure, as was Prime Minister Goh
                    and other Singapore ministers, on the need for an American military presence in
                    Asia. They regarded our military presence as a stabilizing force. Singapore was
                    always very helpful on diplomatic efforts to deal with Cambodia or anyone else.
                    On regional security dialogues, Singapore always advocated moving forward in
                    building regional security institutions. So on almost every issue which we cared
                    about, Singapore was among our greatest friends. There was this single
                    restraining factor, which I think was exaggerated by the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then should we move on to another country or back to talk

                </p>
                <pb facs="0783" n="Page0783"/>
                <p>LORD: The other original of ASEAN as we entered office was Brunei. Without being
                    condescending, I would say that our contacts with Brunei obviously do not
                    reflect a crucial bilateral relationship. Brunei is a very wealthy country. I
                    think that from the point of view of per capita Gross Domestic Product, Brunei
                    is either number one or number two in the world, because of its oil. That gives
                    it some significance, well beyond its tiny size. We would often go to Brunei for
                    financial help in connection with the situation in Bosnia and on KEDO, the
                    agreed framework initiative on Korea. The Brunei Government was never very
                    generous on KEDO, but they did help out on Bosnia. So even though Brunei itself
                    was not that crucial, obviously, because of its financial clout, we were able to
                    arrange meetings between the President and the Sultan of Brunei at APEC
                    meetings, and so on. Even if the meeting involved only a pull aside for 10
                    minutes or so to help us make the point that we wanted their help.</p>
                <p>Brunei has a very authoritarian society in many ways. However, it cooperated with
                    us on the military front and was very friendly in its bilateral relationship
                    with the U.S. It had an extremely able, senior official, Mr. Lim, who was my
                    counterpart. He basically ran Brunei's foreign policy. The Foreign Minister was
                    a relative of the Sultan, and he delegated his authority. It happened that the
                    first senior officials' meeting on regional security for me, which was held
                    every May, took place in Brunei in 1993. We made considerable progress, thanks
                    to the leadership of this gentleman in the Brunei Foreign Ministry. During my
                    tenure as Assistant Secretary I visited Brunei a couple of times. That was one
                    of them, and I went there another time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time were there any border disputes? Did
                        people gealong pretty well together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That was one of the major accomplishments of ASEAN, as I said earlier. They
                    did this by working together as a group diplomatically and moving toward a free
                    trade area, which they affirmed during my time as Assistant Secretary. Despite
                    some financial difficulties, they also subsumed their internal problems with one
                    another. Whether these involved border problems or other, territorial disputes,
                    including refugee problems, none of these really flared up during my tenure.</p>
                <p>It so happened that in the year or two since I left the Department of State,
                    immigration from poorer countries like Indonesia into places like Singapore, the
                    Philippines, and the flow of refugees into Thailand has led to a resurfacing of
                    tensions, particularly between Singapore and Malaysia, over immigration
                    questions. There was a lot of history to this dispute. These problems have been
                    kept quiet and are still relatively quiet. Certainly, between 1993 to 1997 there
                    were no intra-ASEAN tensions on this subject.</p>
                <pb facs="0784" n="Page0784"/>
                <p>Several of the ASEAN countries had conflicting claims to certain islands in the
                    South China Sea, such as the Spratly Islands, and so on. China and Taiwan are
                    also involved in a dispute over some of these islands. The Philippines, Brunei,
                    Vietnam, and Malaysia also have claims to these islands. I may have left some
                    country out. These differences never really reached the point of real tension.
                    As time went on, the ASEAN countries sort of grouped together to exercise a sort
                    of balancing force vis-a-vis China. When we get to regional security matters, I
                    can get back to that point.</p>
                <p>Relations among the ASEAN countries are really quite good, despite certain
                    disparities. Certainly, Thailand and the Philippines are more pro-democratic
                    than Indonesia and Malaysia. However, all of them felt the need to work with us
                    militarily and all of them welcomed our presence in the area. All of them, with
                    the Philippines still engaged in catching up, are doing quite well economically.
                    They are working quite effectively together as a diplomatic force. But with the
                    newer, poorer, more authoritarian countries, ASEAN cohesion will be more
                    difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That leaves Burma.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Let me take a quick break. Then we might go to the other Southeast Asian
                    countries, starting with Vietnam. We can also touch on Laos, Cambodia, and
                    Burma.XXVII. STATE DEPARTMENT ASSISTANT SECRETARY. VIETNAM (1993-1997)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, we're back in business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Let's start with Vietnam, which has recently become a member of ASEAN in
                    its own right. Let's start off by talking about Vietnam primarily in the
                    bilateral context, which most concerns us, on the whole, although better
                    relations between the U.S. and Vietnam made improved relations with ASEAN easier
                    when Vietnam became a member.</p>
                <p>I would say that, from a personal standpoint, I had more personal impact
                    individually, while working with others, of course, on this issue than perhaps
                    on any other matter in the region. I would like to think that I was heavily
                    involved, and I was, in all of the major Asian issues and made a contribution on
                    many of them. However, I think that in terms of the normalization of relations
                    between the U.S. and Vietnam, if I can be slightly immodest, it would not have
                    happened without constant efforts on my part.</p>
                <pb facs="0785" n="Page0785"/>
                <p>This involved a real balancing act. There were several factors in it. First was
                    Hanoi itself, and our negotiations with the Vietnamese Government. Then we had
                    to consider the interests of the White House, which was very sensitive on this
                    issue. The White House was very concerned about domestic, political criticism,
                    particularly since President Clinton had avoided the draft during the Vietnam
                    War. Also important to consider were domestic pressure groups, veterans' groups,
                    and members of the families of the Missing in Action and POWs [Prisoners of
                    War]. They did not all hold the same view. They often had different views, some
                    of them very strongly held. Then there were the political sensitivities of
                    members of Congress, who were on different sides of this issue. They held
                    varying views, but many of them were very suspicious of Hanoi, as were other
                    domestic groups.</p>
                <p>So we constantly had to watch all of these flanks as we tried to move ahead with
                    the Vietnamese-American relationship. I believe that the policy we ultimately
                    followed was one of our most constructive and most successful during these four
                    years. We moved from the point where we inherited this issue to full, diplomatic
                    relations by the time we were finished, less than four years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe how the Bush administration handled
                        this issue,to understand where you moved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Absolutely. I would like to make a general introduction. I also think that
                    this was one of the understated achievements, when people talk about foreign
                    policy successes in Asia and generally in Clinton's first four years in office.
                    They often leave out Vietnam, or barely mention it. I'm not claiming that this
                    was a cosmic issue of great importance, but creating a new relationship was a
                    substantial achievement.</p>
                <p>Vietnam is really a much bigger country than many people realize. I think that
                    the population was estimated at about 70 million in 1994. It is potentially a
                    dynamic country, despite its tragic history. Given the sensitivities and wounds
                    in our society, it was significant that we moved toward normalization of
                    relations with Vietnam. Given the sensitivities, it was not an issue which the
                    White House ever played up in terms of trumpeting success.</p>
                <p>A quick note on my own background. As we have discussed elsewhere, I was heavily
                    involved in the Vietnam negotiations in the early 1970s with Dr. Kissinger, on
                    behalf of President Nixon. Indeed I drafted much of the peace agreement. These
                    were secret negotiations. So I dealt with Hanoi representatives during that
                    period and, quite frankly, got to distrust them very much. I didn't dislike them
                    personally so much as I realized that these were tough bastards who subsequently
                    then broke the agreement which we had negotiated.</p>
                <pb facs="0786" n="Page0786"/>
                <p>Consequently, I had a lot of mistrust for Vietnam, not only because they broke
                    the agreement of 1973, but I felt that the Vietnamese communist leaders weren't
                    cooperating fully on POWs [Prisoners of War] and MIAs [Missing in Action] in the
                    1970s and 1980s. I had a lot of sympathy for the families and the veterans,
                    their frustration over this issue. There was as well Vietnam's general
                    authoritarianism; I didn't like their human rights violations. I didn't
                    particularly appreciate Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in 1979, although
                    anything that gets rid of the Khmer Rouge can't be all bad. I opposed Vietnam's
                    invasion of Cambodia on the general principle that they violated an
                    internationally recognized border. However, my own background of suspicion,
                    distrust, and even antipathy toward the Vietnamese with whom I dealt was not
                    personal or anything like that with the people, of course. I had great respect
                    for the Vietnamese people, including their tremendous success as immigrants to
                    this country.</p>
                <p>On the other hand I also had a sense that Vietnam was an important country. It
                    was important to try to heal the wounds left by the Vietnam War in our society.
                    Moving ahead in relations was our best bet to get more information on our
                    missing in action. Vietnam was also potentially important from the economic
                    point of view. It obviously was also important in geopolitical terms. It has a
                    large and dynamic population. Given the traditional Vietnamese antagonism toward
                    China, it was also useful, in dealing with China, with which we wanted better
                    relations, to improve our relations with some of China's historical enemies.
                    This was just to remind the Chinese of the balance of power considerations
                    applicable in this situation, whether it involved India, Vietnam, Russia, or
                    Japan. Having good relations with those countries is helpful when we deal with
                    China. So, for all of these reasons I felt that it was important to try to move
                    ahead with Vietnam, even though I had this distrust of them.</p>
                <p>Now, when the Clinton Administration entered office, I thought that the
                    preceding, Bush administration had followed a pretty constructive policy. They
                    were following what was called a road map, which was adopted back in about 1991
                    or so. One of my predecessors as Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific
                    Affairs, Dick Solomon, had a lot to do with developing this road map. They had
                    arranged with Vietnam that, to the extent that the Vietnamese were more
                    forthcoming on MIA and POW issues, the U.S. would be more forthcoming with them
                    on economic and other issues. The human rights issue really wasn't included in
                    the road map, although it was always mentioned. The argument was that if the
                    Vietnamese did certain things on MIA and POW issues, we would do certain things
                    in return.</p>
                <p>I generally supported this policy. I felt that, both on the merits and for
                    political reasons in our own society, making progress in getting more
                    information on the Missing in Action and the Prisoner of War questions was
                    important. We would try to exert leverage on these matters. It was important to
                    try to move ahead with the relationship between Vietnam and the United
                    States.</p>
                <pb facs="0787" n="Page0787"/>
                <p>We adopted this general approach of the road map. I think that we were a little
                    bit more forceful about it. Our strategy was essentially to avoid two extremes
                    of policy, and I think that the Bush administration was doing that as well. In
                    short, we sought to pursue a middle course. One extreme was to seek to isolate
                    Vietnam and to display hostility toward it. Under this heading we would say, in
                    effect: “Until you do everything that we want on the MIA/POW questions, we're
                    not going to do anything with you people.” The Clinton administration felt, and
                    I did also, that this course wasn't going to produce progress. We felt that we
                    had to give the Vietnamese some incentive to be forthcoming on MIAs and POWs.
                    The Vietnamese had their own bitterness left over from the war. They had many
                    more dead and missing than we. They had their own domestic problems. Just in
                    pure, pragmatic terms, they probably wouldn't be forthcoming with such
                    information, even though we might say that they should be, in terms of honor and
                    humanitarian considerations, unless they saw something in it for them.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, I was certainly not in favor of great leaps forward with the
                    Vietnamese, such as promising the normalization of diplomatic relations, moving
                    ahead immediately on economic issues, hoping that this would induce them to be
                    friendlier and more forthcoming. I thought that such a course would give away
                    our leverage. Knowing the Vietnamese as I did from the negotiations on the Peace
                    Agreement of 1973, I knew what tough customers they were. I felt that we had to
                    have a more nuanced approach.</p>
                <p>So we followed a more middle ground approach where we would have some engagement
                    to gain cooperation, make clear that the MIA/POW question was the number one
                    issue, but also make clear that we would be willing to work with the Vietnamese
                    and improve our relationship. We proceeded to make incremental progress in this
                    regard. In exchange for progress for MIAs, over time we moved to loosen some
                    economic restrictions and moved toward normalization in a series of steps.</p>
                <p>We didn't follow the exact road map of the Bush administration, although we found
                    their general approach and some of the criteria in it quite useful. We didn't
                    reject this approach as a whole but we didn't insist that that particular
                    blueprint had to be followed. One thing we did bureaucratically was rather
                    tricky. In our own interagency group, which looked at the MIA/POW question and
                    Vietnam policy as a whole, we had an anomalous situation. The head of the
                    biggest MIA family group was a member of that group, along with U.S. Government
                    officials, helping to make policy. I thought that it was crucially important to
                    maintain contact with her, with the other MIA groups, and with veterans' groups.
                    They had every right to have a say about our policy and help us with what we
                    needed on MIAs and POWs. However, I thought that it was absolutely crazy to have
                    such an outsider a member of this policy group, no matter what his or her
                    position was. I felt that a private citizen shouldn't sit in on a government
                    agency group determining our policy on this issue, especially given the
                    sensitivities of the issue and the personal stakes.</p>
                <pb facs="0788" n="Page0788"/>
                <p>So, as we decided on the way we would approach Vietnam policy bureaucratically, I
                    let her participation in the interagency group lapse. She was quite upset about
                    this and complained to the White House. However, we managed to do this on the
                    basic principle that we should not have private outsiders as members of U.S.
                    Government groups. We sought gradually to get her where she should be, along
                    with the representatives of other family groups and veterans groups having an
                    absolute right to appeal to us and work with and coordinate with us, but not to
                    be a member of the decision making body within the government.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you explain for the record what we mean when we talk about MIAs, what
                    the situation was, and how it had progressed, because this is a crucial
                    consideration?</p>
                <p>LORD: Absolutely. I should say, because of my own background, that I had
                    testified at very sensitive hearings during the latter part of 1992. This was
                    actually a few months before I knew that I was coming back into government
                    service. My testimony was before the Joint Congressional Committee, of which
                    Senator Smith [Republican, New Hampshire] was a member. He was very tough on
                    this issue. Another member of this committee was Senator Kerrey [Democrat,
                    Nebraska]. He was a war hero and was in favor of moving ahead with Vietnam. The
                    Joint Committee held extensive hearings and tried to get the facts together and
                    see exactly where we were, along the lines of what you said.</p>
                <p>The first issue, which was very vivid in the 1970s and 1980s but which began to
                    fade as time went on, was whether there were any more live Americans being held
                    by the Vietnamese communists. I might say that this confused the POW/MIA issue.
                    The term “POW” suggested that the Vietnamese still held some of our prisoners of
                    war. This continues even to this day to be controversial in some areas. However,
                    most of those particularly interested in this matter, including even family
                    members and members of veterans' groups, feel that the Vietnamese no longer hold
                    prisoners of war. There would occasionally be alleged sightings of Caucasians
                    apparently held by the Vietnamese. On a couple of occasions they may have been
                    deserters or were other Caucasians, such as Australians or French. I don't have
                    all of the details on this. There would be occasional incidents of people who
                    claimed that they saw Americans being held. However, there was never any proof
                    of this.</p>
                <p>I'm not saying that just after the Vietnam Peace Agreement was reached in 1973
                    that the Vietnamese communists might not still have held some POWs whom they
                    kept back or held POWs who later died in captivity - out of a sense of
                    embarrassment, the Vietnamese might have sought to cover these cases up. It is
                    possible, but we never had any proof of it. We never got as many prisoners back
                    as the estimates of numbers of POWs whom we thought that we should have gotten
                    back, who we thought were still alive after their capture. There were examples
                    of cases where pilots were shot down, and the U.S. command had radio
                    communications from them after they reached the ground. So we knew that they had
                    been captured, as opposed to being dead. However, some of them basically were
                    never accounted for after that. The Vietnamese communists said that they had
                    died, or something to that effect.</p>
                <pb facs="0789" n="Page0789"/>
                <p>So there was enough ambiguity, on top of Vietnamese foot dragging and general
                    lying and brutality, so that even the existence of live POWs certainly was an
                    issue in the 1970s and 1980s. However, by the time the Clinton Administration
                    came into office in 1993, the great focus was on MIAs, whom I'll get to in a
                    minute, and not on whether the Vietnamese still had live prisoners. The
                    Vietnamese would continually deny that they had live prisoners.</p>
                <p>On very pragmatic grounds I tended to believe that the Vietnamese didn't have any
                    live prisoners of war. The Vietnamese were brutal enough to deceive us on this
                    issue. However, for the life of me I couldn't see why this would do them any
                    good. It seemed to me that if we didn't know that the Vietnamese held any more
                    live POWs, and they denied that they had them, what leverage would this provide
                    them for trade or any other reason? If they ever did use them in some respect
                    and they said: “Oh, yes, by the way, we do have a few live American prisoners,
                    we'll give them back in exchange for MFN [Most Favored Nation] trade status” or
                    something like that, there would be incredible outrage in the United States that
                    the Vietnamese had held American POWs for 20 years or so. And that would rule
                    out any progress in developing our relationship.</p>
                <p>So, on purely practical grounds, I just didn't see why the Vietnamese would be
                    holding live American prisoners. Not that they weren't capable of doing this in
                    terms of brutality, but I didn't see what their self interest would be in doing
                    this.</p>
                <p>When I was working as Special Assistant to Dr. Kissinger, I always wondered
                    whether there might have been some POWs left over after the Peace Agreement,
                    despite our best efforts to settle this issue. The Vietnamese may have held some
                    POWs back, originally, perhaps because they didn't want to turn them over
                    because they'd been so brutally treated. And perhaps then didn't want to
                    acknowledge that some had eventually died in prison. So it's possible that, for
                    a while, the Vietnamese communists had some POWs that we didn't get back. We
                    don't have any proof of that. After awhile, I personally never felt that the
                    Vietnamese communists were holding any more, although we always raised the
                    matter out of principle, just in case they were. Every conceivable lead was
                    followed up before the Clinton administration entered office and, of course,
                    during the Clinton administration whenever there was any ambiguity. There was
                    never anything close to proof of live prisoners. That consideration was always
                    there, but it was not the main focus. Most of the POW/MIA family people and the
                    veterans groups agreed that this was no longer a big issue.</p>
                <p>There was, however, a minority of people among the POW/MIA groups that felt that
                    the Vietnamese communists were still holding live POWs. Part of the reason for
                    this was that there was understandable anguish on the part of loved ones who had
                    no accounting for missing family members. They were just hoping that they were
                    alive, without any evidence to this effect. Part of this hope was based on
                    evidence on some of those that were caught by the Vietnamese communists. There
                    was never an accounting for them.</p>
                <pb facs="0790" n="Page0790"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The POW/MIA groups were a political movement, to a certain
                        extent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. I want to get to that point. Absolutely. On the MIA question, this was
                    a matter of accounting for Americans, so that people would get their remains
                    back, such as bones or whatever, which they could bury in this country and get
                    some closure on their grief. Or, at a minimum, they could find out what exactly
                    happened and put any uncertainty to rest that there was a possibility that their
                    family member was still being held prisoner. Or, at least, they could find out
                    and come to terms with the fact that their loved one had died. They would know
                    what happened. Where they were and what happened? Did they die when they first
                    crashed, or did they die in prison? These kind of considerations.</p>
                <p>Of course, we are a country, and I think that we are to be admired for it, which
                    puts more stress on this matter than any other country, in terms of finding
                    remains or collecting information on its MIAs. We put an enormous amount of
                    effort into this, and not only diplomatically. Indeed, all of our MIA teams are
                    out there, searching, digging, and facing dangerous conditions to try to find
                    teeth, bones, and so forth. This is absolutely extraordinary. I think that this
                    amazed the Vietnamese communists.</p>
                <p>So the issue regarding the MIAs was to get an accounting for those who were still
                    left unaccounted for. There were a couple such cases which we hadn't definitely
                    been accounted for as either dead or returned to us. Among those 2,000 or so,
                    there were some leads which were more promising than others. There were the
                    so-called “live sightings.” I forget what the exact phrase was. These involved
                    people who had been in contact by radio or on the ground after being shot down,
                    for example, and we knew that they hadn't died as of that time. Or it involved
                    former prisoners who came out and said that they remembered seeing somebody, at
                    some point, in some prison. Some of these leads even went back to some of the
                    most promising cases we raised with the Vietnamese communists after the
                    Agreement of January, 1973. We were still trying to get more information. So
                    there were some special cases that seemed to be promising.</p>
                <p>In addition to finding further information, of course, there was an attempt to
                    try and find actual remains using DNA analysis and identification when the
                    remains were discovered. On this basis we might then be able to determine who
                    the individual was. So that effort was made on what actually happened to
                    people.</p>
                <p>We also wanted increased access to Vietnamese communist archives and their own
                    files to see what could be found. We would also deal with the Russians and the
                    Chinese to try to get any information which they might have on Americans missing
                    in action. So the focus was on information, remains, and what happened to the
                    MIAs and their histories.</p>
                <pb facs="0791" n="Page0791"/>
                <p>The fact is that there were very tough U.S. criteria in effect to remove someone
                    from the MIA list. I forget the numbers, but the total number of between 2,000
                    and 3,000 was always cited as the number of people that hadn't accounted for.
                    The fact was that you could only get somebody off that MIA list in one of two
                    ways. One was if the person were returned alive. Of course, as I said, that was
                    becoming impossible. Secondly, there had to be absolute, total verification of
                    remains, such as, for example, dental records or DNA evidence.</p>
                <p>If you didn't have either of those two outcomes, then, even though you were sure,
                    on other grounds, that this person was decisively identified, you couldn't take
                    him off the list. For example, we had several hundred pilots who had been shot
                    down, and we had verification that they had dived into the sea. I think that
                    were something like 400 cases like this. You could never get their remains
                    because they were at the bottom of the sea in 1,000 feet of water, or so. We
                    knew that they had fallen into the sea. People had even seen their planes go in.
                    Yet they could still be on the MIA list, because we didn't have either a body,
                    DNA evidence, or a dental record.</p>
                <p>Or there was, for example, crashes in remote places. We would have “dog tags
                    [identification tags]” or bones, but not enough to get a reliable DNA sample. We
                    would have an exact location and the testimony of nearby villagers who said that
                    these people had died. We had confirmation from military communications and
                    records that these people went down at a certain point. We might have this
                    person's boots, with his name in them. However, he would still be on the MIA
                    list because we didn't have an actual DNA sample, dental records, the remains,
                    or a live body.</p>
                <p>So the evidence would sometimes be very strong but still not sufficient to take
                    names off the list. We spent most of our time working on a couple of hundred
                    cases where, we felt, there was the best chance of getting more information.</p>
                <p>Now, in terms of your question about motives. First, as I said, I had, and we all
                    had, a lot of empathy for the families and the veterans organizations and the
                    admirable instincts to come to closure and bring our men home and remove
                    ambiguities and doubts. The great bulk of the veterans groups and the MIA
                    families had good motives and were genuinely concerned. Some were more
                    supportive and some were more suspicious of the U.S. Government. In the past the
                    U.S. Government had not made as vigorous an effort as, I think, it made in the
                    1980s under the Bush administration and thereafter. I think that there was some
                    sloppiness in record keeping and so on, which bred distrust and frustration
                    among the families and veterans. Most of these people were very well
                    meaning.</p>
                <pb facs="0792" n="Page0792"/>
                <p>There were others, I think, who had become almost paranoid about this and had
                    become so suspicious of the U.S. Government that really they had become unfair
                    and were stoking political fires. They were so hostile to the Vietnamese
                    communists that they didn't trust them on anything. They were genuinely
                    convinced, I think, that the Vietnamese communists were such evil people that
                    they were holding things back, and the U.S. Government wasn't making enough of
                    an effort. There were others, in Congress and elsewhere, who were just playing
                    to domestic political considerations, the residual frustration over losing that
                    war, and our hatred and distrust of the Vietnamese communists.</p>
                <p>For some, to be crude about it, this subject had become something of a “cottage
                    industry.” Certain people could make a living, as it were, by continuing to be
                    consultants, by pressing this issue, and by claiming that the U.S. Government
                    wasn't cooperating. They were in it to get publicity and/or funding for their
                    efforts.</p>
                <p>So there was a mixed bag of considerations, but there was overall a strong
                    political reality to this matter. Moreover, we owed it to the families, the
                    veterans, and our sense of honor to pursue this.</p>
                <p>Also, as I said, we had other interests in Vietnam which we wanted to pursue. So
                    the trick was to keep this quest at the top of our agenda and have a version of
                    a road map approach that would give Hanoi some incentive to move ahead. We had a
                    lot of reasons for moving ahead.</p>
                <p>First, we felt that incremental engagement, if we didn't “leap frog” and lose all
                    of our leverage, was the best way to make progress on the MIA question. That was
                    our top objective, and the best way to get information. We rejected the two
                    extremes - throwing away all of our leverage through major concessions on the
                    one hand, or being hostile and standoffish so that Vietnam had no incentive to
                    be cooperative, on the other. So we felt that this measured engagement was the
                    best way to make progress on the single, biggest issue, the MIAs. We also knew
                    that we had to make progress on that issue so that we would be able politically
                    to move ahead generally with Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Secondly, we had some potential economic interests with Vietnam, both now, and
                    greater potential in the future, given the relatively large population of
                    Vietnam, the spirit of entrepreneurship of the people, and the possibility of
                    finding oil and other resources off the Vietnamese coast. I remember that the
                    American oil industry was interested in getting into Vietnam. In fact, some
                    American oil companies had held oil prospecting permits issued by the former
                    Saigon Government. There could be considerable trade and investment prospects in
                    Vietnam at some point.</p>
                <pb facs="0793" n="Page0793"/>
                <p>Thirdly, there was the general question of our influence in Southeast Asia, both
                    in terms of Vietnam itself and when it became a member of ASEAN. This affected
                    both our bilateral ties with Vietnam as well as when Vietnam became a member of
                    ASEAN. Also, Vietnam would be a balance to China in a modest way, with all of
                    the advantages of that.</p>
                <p>Then there were other, specific issues on the agenda which we wanted to pursue.
                    For example, cooperation on drugs and narcotics, which was an important issue
                    both there in Vietnam and generally in Southeast Asia. We wanted to encourage
                    the Vietnamese to behave responsibly in Cambodia and try to promote stability
                    there. It was also in our general interest to build a Pacific Community,
                    including our former adversaries, whether it was China or Vietnam, and try to
                    maintain U.S. influence in the area. Finally, moving ahead on normalizing
                    relations with Vietnam would have benefits in our own society, healing the
                    wounds in this country that still existed from that war, and trying to put it
                    behind us. So for all of these reasons we wanted to move ahead, and it was
                    important that we do so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting much support from the Asian countries
                        onormalization of relations between the U.S. and Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: The Asian countries generally supported us and wanted us to move ahead on
                    normalization of relations with Vietnam. Most of them had already normalized
                    relations and had fairly good contacts with Vietnam. Japan was holding back a
                    little bit because of our desire that they not give too much aid to Vietnam
                    until we made more progress on the MIA issue. They wanted us to move ahead so
                    that they could move ahead.</p>
                <p>China was ambivalent. On the one hand, they would say that we should move ahead
                    without worrying about issues like MIAs and human rights. They would ask why
                    shouldn't we have normal relations? However, underneath this, I think that they
                    would just as soon we not have good relations with Vietnam because of their own
                    historical antagonism with Vietnam. One of their concerns probably was that
                    normal relations with Vietnam would give us more leverage against China. For
                    historical reasons the French would say that we should move ahead on relations
                    with Vietnam. So most countries thought that we should make progress in this
                    direction.</p>
                <p>Now, a little more on the politics of this issue. I've already said that the
                    White House was very sensitive on this question. Making progress on this matter
                    was often like pulling teeth. Secretary Christopher was very helpful on this
                    matter. He spent a lot of time on this. I spent a lot of time with him to get
                    him working on it at his level. He wanted to move ahead, along all of the lines
                    I mentioned, as did many people in the State Department. I had terrific support
                    in my own bureau with outstanding FSOs, like Peter Tomsen, Ken Quinn, Kent
                    Weidemann, Chris LaFleur, with experience in the area.</p>
                <pb facs="0794" n="Page0794"/>
                <p>The U.S. economic agencies were anxious to move ahead because of the economic
                    dimension in particular. The Defense Department, including the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff, wanted to move ahead, probably because they thought that we could get
                    more information on the MIAs and partly because they saw the China aspect I
                    mentioned above. Just generally, in terms of our interests in the area, they
                    thought that having a better relationship with Vietnam wouldn't be all bad.</p>
                <p>So there was a widely held view in the U.S. Government that we shoulbe moving
                    ahead, with the single huge exception of the White House.</p>
                <p>In these memoirs I won't be criticizing people, particularly friends, whom I
                    respect. However, I have to say that Tony Lake [National Security Adviser] in
                    particular, whom I admire and with whom I worked on many issues, was the single,
                    biggest brake on the policy of normalization of relations. I don't question his
                    motives or his values. But frankly, I could never figure out whether he felt
                    that he was protecting President Clinton and his domestic, political interests.
                    Tony Lake had been heavily involved in Vietnam in many ways, as I had. Who
                    knows? Maybe there were some psychological problems involved. On the other hand,
                    Tony was very helpful in maintaining good relations with the MIA groups. He and
                    I talked to them together and separately on numerous occasions, and we
                    maintained close coordination on that plane.</p>
                <p>However, there is no question that he, and the White House more generally, were
                    the biggest brakes on our moving ahead. Toward the end of this 1993-1997 period,
                    I think he was more positive on relations with Vietnam. By then both he and the
                    President could see that there was modest political damage, and indeed some
                    benefit, from moving ahead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling about the instincts of the
                        President othis issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: No. To be honest about it, I never could really figure out how much of this
                    feeling of reservation about Vietnam was Tony Lake's and how much was the
                    President's. Tony and I worked together very well on Asian policy, particularly
                    toward the end of this period. I think that he would agree that he was much more
                    cautious on this issue than I was, or the other players in the Government. It
                    would be interesting to find out what his instincts were. He shared our genuine
                    desire to get information on the MIAs, but I thought that the way to do this was
                    to move ahead on normalization with Vietnam. Part of it may have been domestic
                    politics in the U.S. We all distrusted Hanoi; that wasn't the problem.So this
                    really was rather puzzling to me, and there was a constant question of how we
                    could get the White House to move on this issue. There was foot dragging and an
                    attitude of slowing down and caution. So that was a major problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0795" n="Page0795"/>
                <p>Now, in Congress there were some people who were very tough on this issue, like
                    Senator Smith [Republican, New Hampshire] and several Congressmen who just
                    didn't want us to do anything with Hanoi until we had much more information on
                    the MIAs, and so on. To counter this, there was a crucial element of
                    senators/congressmen who really allowed the President to move ahead. This was an
                    absolutely fundamental consideration on the political scene which enabled us to
                    move ahead.</p>
                <p>On the Senate side there was Senator John Kerry [Democrat, Massachusetts],
                    Senator Bob Kerrey [Democrat, Nebraska], and Senator John McCain [Republican,
                    Arizona]. There was Congressman Pete Peterson on the House of Representatives
                    side. Now, Pete Peterson is no longer in Congress and is presently our
                    Ambassador to Vietnam. All of these members of Congress had been POWs and/or war
                    heroes. Therefore, when they said that we should move ahead with normalization
                    of relations with Vietnam, they gave tremendous political cover to President
                    Clinton. So, particularly given the President's record during the Vietnam War,
                    we couldn't have normalized relations with Vietnam without their support.</p>
                <p>For example, their efforts included those of Senator Kerrey on the Senate
                    Committee on finding out and putting to rest some of the more extreme versions
                    of Hanoi's lack of cooperation on the MIA issue, including the issue of live
                    prisoners. He spoke out generally, he visited Vietnam and pressed the Vietnamese
                    authorities, and he worked with conservatives in the U.S. on this issue. These
                    gentlemen took a lot of flak and heat from those elements in the veterans' and
                    family groups who didn't want to normalize relations with Hanoi. They were
                    active in handling letters, speeches, and doing all sorts of things. Senators
                    Kerry and McCain did likewise. So I'll always be grateful, and I know that
                    President Clinton will be, for the cover that these people gave him.</p>
                <p>Senator John McCain spent five or six years in a Hanoi prisoner of war camp,
                    where he was held in solitary confinement and was often beaten up by his
                    captors. When he said that it was in our interests to move ahead on
                    normalization of relations with Vietnam, who could be holier than he?</p>
                <p>So the attitudes of these members of Congress were absolutely fundamental to
                    normalization of relations with Vietnam. I spent a great deal of time working
                    with those members of Congress and others, on the House and Senate side, on this
                    issue. As I said, I also spent a lot of time speaking to MIA and veterans'
                    groups and dealing with them, to get their views on how to proceed, and to
                    underline our commitment to their cause.</p>
                <p>Q: Because it might have gotten lost, you might explain that, while we didn't
                    have formal diplomatic relations with Vietnam, unlike North Korea, which is
                    really sealed off, we had all sorts of contacts with Vietnam. There were visits
                    by prominent Americans to Vietnam. Even teams went out to Hanoi to talk
                    abouMIAs.</p>
                <pb facs="0796" n="Page0796"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes, we had teams in Hanoi which we greatly beefed up under the Clinton
                    administration. We had people up there, even before the Clinton administration
                    entered office, searching for remains of MIAs. We were working with the
                    Vietnamese to get more information. Our military people doing this were
                    extremely dedicated, and doing hard, sometimes dangerous, work.</p>
                <p>There were some official American visitors going to Vietnam. We were not totally
                    isolated from Vietnam, as was the case with North Korea and some other
                    countries. We had an embargo on trade. We also blocked World Bank and IMF loans
                    to Vietnam. Of course, we had no Embassy, Liaison Office, or anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But we had an immigration program, the so-called orderly
                        departurprogram.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's right. The orderly departure program helped people get out of
                    Vietnam and travel to the United States if they wished to do so. There was also
                    the problem of Vietnamese boat people who escaped from Vietnam and went to Hong
                    Kong or to one of several countries in Southeast Asia. We tried to work with the
                    Vietnamese authorities on that.</p>
                <p>There was some contact with Vietnam, including under the Bush administration.
                    There were at least one or two meetings with the Vietnamese, I think, at the
                    undersecretary level. So the Bush administration made some progress in getting
                    information. However, there hadn't been much progress in moving ahead with
                    Vietnam generally, although Vietnam was not as isolated as North Korea had been
                    and still is. Nevertheless, Vietnam was clearly an area where we had very little
                    interchange, only sporadic visits, and some cooperation on MIAs. There was no
                    trade or investment. Generally, this was a pretty hostile relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our reading on the Vietnamese Government at that
                        time?That is, in 1993.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, it was pretty authoritarian. There were some indications even then,
                    in 1993, and the process continued, that there was a desire in Vietnam to reform
                    their economy. Somewhat like what the Chinese had done, to open up to some
                    extent to the outside world. The Vietnamese Government seemed to be interested
                    in trying to get more foreign investment. However, the picture on human rights
                    in Vietnam was still very grim. So that was our general impression. There were
                    some members of the leadership who were considered more pro-reform than others.
                    However, it was going to be a tough row to hoe, certainly in the field of human
                    rights. But there were some indications that the Vietnamese Government was
                    opening up.</p>
                <pb facs="0797" n="Page0797"/>
                <p>As we looked at the situation in Vietnam, I've explained what we saw in it for
                    us, in terms of moving ahead. From the Vietnamese point of view, first they had
                    a major economic incentive to open up with us. That is, getting American trade
                    and investment to help them in their efforts to open up to the outside world
                    generally, in a way similar to what China had done, and to reform their economy.
                    So they clearly had a tremendous, potential economic interest in normalizing
                    relations with us. Not only oil research, for example, but investment generally
                    and all kinds of other things.</p>
                <p>Secondly, Hanoi had a general sense of diplomatic isolation because of us. The
                    Vietnamese knew that we were, in effect, holding Japan back somewhat, for
                    example. If they could normalize relations with us, this would open the
                    diplomatic gates more generally. They managed to have pretty good relations with
                    other countries, but normalization with the U.S. would generally help them.
                    Thirdly, more specifically on the diplomatic and geopolitical front was their
                    concern about China. By normalizing relations with us they would have some
                    assurance and/or leverage vis-a-vis the Chinese.</p>
                <p>So for these economic and geopolitical reasons, we figured that they had a lot of
                    incentives to work with us. The trick was to play on those incentives to get the
                    Vietnamese to be more cooperative on the MIA and the POW questions, in their own
                    self interest.</p>
                <p>I would like to make one more quick point, before I forget. I have talked about
                    my own role, somewhat immodestly, but I could not have done this without
                    tremendous help from a lot of Foreign Service Officers, and particularly Ken
                    Quinn, who, as we speak, is now our Ambassador to Cambodia. Also, Kent
                    Wiedemann, who is supposed to be our next Ambassador to Cambodia. There were
                    other Foreign Service Officers, including Chris LaFleur, who is now DCM [Deputy
                    Chief of Mission] in Tokyo. He was previously on the Vietnam desk. Desaix
                    Anderson, who became our first Ambassador as we moved ahead. A lot of people
                    worked very hard on this process of normalization. Obviously, this was always a
                    collective effort.</p>
                <p>Now, basically what we did in the course of several years was to make some
                    progress on MIAs and then take a step forward in the relationship between
                    Vietnam and the United States. One way we went about this was that we had to
                    have some criteria to define progress on MIAs.</p>
                <pb facs="0798" n="Page0798"/>
                <p>I don't have all of these yardsticks at my fingertips, but we had four or five
                    main areas where we wanted to see progress made. These included, I recall,
                    finding the remains of MIAs. That is, getting as many remains back as possible.
                    Also included in the yardsticks was information on the missing in action,
                    particularly the most promising cases. There were about a couple of hundred of
                    these cases. We sought access to Vietnamese archives to get more information on
                    the histories. Also, we wanted cooperation from the Vietnamese people. It wasn't
                    just getting cooperation from Vietnamese Government officials. We also needed
                    cooperation from villagers, some of whom might have seen things relating to the
                    MIAs. The Vietnamese Government people always said that one way we could get
                    help from the villagers was “to help us with our MIAs,” even though they didn't
                    care as much about them as we did about our MIAs. We did try to help them with
                    their MIAs in terms of turning over our own records and archives, so they could
                    go to their own people and say that the Americans are helping us with Vietnamese
                    MIAs. They would then ask the village people to volunteer information to us.</p>
                <p>One thing that the Vietnamese Government officials did was that, in their
                    communications with their own people, they made it clear that they should
                    cooperate and that it was in their interest to do so. Some of the Vietnamese
                    people might not want to cooperate because they had bitter memories of the war,
                    the American bombing, and so forth. So it was important to show that we
                    Americans were providing the Vietnamese officials with information on Vietnamese
                    MIAs. I recall that I went on a couple of trips to Vietnam where we brought
                    information on their MIAs, so that they could tell their own people that they
                    ought to cooperate with us.</p>
                <p>Another criterion was cooperation with Laos and triangular searches. A lot of MIA
                    cases involved locations in Laos, as well as some in Cambodia. I might add
                    quickly that Cambodia was always the most forthcoming of the three countries of
                    the former Indochina on the MIA question, although it was the least important in
                    terms of information. The situation of MIAs in Laos provided a mixed picture.
                    The Laotian authorities were generally quite helpful. However, they were
                    generally poor in providing logistic help, so our assistance was needed.</p>
                <p>So we had these criteria and probably some others that I've forgotten. Whenever
                    we wanted to take a step forward, and I'll mention these in just a minute, we
                    would also have White House white papers and State Department press releases,
                    explaining how the Vietnamese Government had stepped up their cooperation,
                    before we could take another step in normalizing our relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0799" n="Page0799"/>
                <p>In addition to dealing with Congress to get support, President Clinton also sent
                    special missions to Vietnam to deal with MIA questions. I was Co-Chairman of
                    these special missions, along with a man named Herschel Goldberg, who played a
                    crucial role in them. Herschel Goldberg was the Deputy Director of the
                    Department of Veterans Affairs. He was from Arkansas and had been working on
                    veterans' affairs in Arkansas. He was on close terms with President Clinton.
                    Then he came into office as the second ranking official in the Veterans
                    Department. He also had served in Vietnam and spoke some Vietnamese. Because he
                    represented veterans' interests and because he, himself, was suspicious of
                    Hanoi, was from Arkansas, and was close to President Clinton, I welcomed his
                    cooperation in this effort, in which he became heavily involved. It turned out
                    that his involvement in these special missions was crucial to their success. So
                    it wasn't just the State Department, the Defense Department, the JCS [Joint
                    Chiefs of Staff], the economic agencies, and the White House. The Veterans
                    Administration, which obviously had a clear interest in the Vietnam issue, was
                    represented by Herschel Goldberg, its deputy director, who turned out to be very
                    important in this regard.</p>
                <p>If somebody goes to the President and says: “The Vietnamese Government is
                    cooperating on MIA issues, and we ought to move ahead to broaden trade, or
                    something like that, with Vietnam,” and this person is from the State
                    Department, from the Defense Department, or one of the economic agencies, the
                    impact would be less than if Goldberg did. Not that we wouldn't have
                    credibility, but the President might say: “Well, how do I know that the
                    Vietnamese Government is really helping us?” So when a tough-minded, suspicious
                    guy like Herschel Goldberg would say this to the President, it would carry a lot
                    of weight. Also, Goldberg was very helpful with veterans groups and, to a
                    certain extent, with the MIA families organizations. He would have more
                    credibility with them than State Department or even Defense types. Tony Lake and
                    I in particular worked with family and veteran groups as well. I made several
                    appearances before them as well as consulting them.</p>
                <p>From the very beginning and even before I had personally met him, I saw Goldberg
                    as an asset. As I say, he turned out to be very crucial. He and I headed up
                    several Presidential Missions to Vietnam. I was always an equal ranking member
                    of the mission but was mainly concerned with the political side of it. I would
                    make sure that Goldberg was treated as the first among equals, even though we
                    were co-chairmen of the mission. In fact, the NSC [National Security Council]
                    representative on the mission, whether it was Wiedemann or Roth, would be the
                    third-ranking person. Goldberg was the co-chairman and was the “first among
                    equals,” as he should have been, both because he was a sub- cabinet level
                    official and also because he was close to the President. I felt that, for
                    credibility purposes, it was very important for our domestic audiences to see
                    that the number one person on the team was a Veterans Department man and not a
                    State Department official.</p>
                <pb facs="0800" n="Page0800"/>
                <p>Goldberg and I worked extremely well together. It was not because we particularly
                    liked or trusted the Vietnamese Government officials we met on the successive
                    trips to Vietnam, though we liked the Vietnamese people. Rather we saw that it
                    was in the self-interest of the Vietnamese Government to help us on MIAs.
                    Because of our efforts to press them on this matter, they were, in fact,
                    cooperating, and we were able to go ahead on the normalization of relations. We
                    regularly made reports to President Clinton after these trips on the cooperation
                    we had received from Vietnamese Government officials. This had credibility
                    because Goldberg was involved in preparing these reports, in addition to myself,
                    the Defense Department people, and so on. We always had an officer dealing with
                    POW/MIA matters from the Defense Department at about my level, as well as other
                    experts from the Pentagon and so on.</p>
                <p>We made several of these trips. I made some trips on my own but often went with
                    Herschel Goldberg. On the first couple of trips we also had some representatives
                    of MIA and veterans groups with us, because they could help us prepare for the
                    trip, sit in on the discussions with the Vietnamese, and also report back to the
                    President, as did Goldberg and myself. This was somewhat of a risk. We had to
                    include various members, some of whom were more radical than others and more
                    distrustful of U.S. Government officials. However, we felt that this was a good
                    move in terms of domestic politics, since it gave them a chance to participate
                    on these trips. Secondly, it made it possible to bring more leverage and
                    pressure to bear on the Vietnamese officials because they would be sitting in on
                    these meetings. The Vietnamese officials would hear directly from MIA family
                    representatives and from U.S. veterans groups and could see how important this
                    matter was to us, from the political point of view.</p>
                <p>These representatives also gave us some good advice. We constantly had to make
                    sure that we were in charge of the talking points. We often would go over our
                    approaches with them before the trips, though we couldn't give family group and
                    veterans organization representatives a veto over talking points. On these trips
                    we would make our presentation. Then we would turn to the veterans and the MIA
                    family representatives. They would make their own comments, individually.</p>
                <p>I would say that in the veterans community there were different groups. Some of
                    them were willing to follow our approach. Others were more suspicious of the
                    U.S. Government. We didn't convert everybody. Some of these representatives were
                    still hostile to the Vietnamese Government and didn't want to go ahead on
                    normalizing relations with Vietnam. Others were already in favor of going ahead.
                    I think that some of those in the middle were somewhat influenced to cooperate
                    with us once they went on these trips.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were talking to the Vietnamese officials, what
                        was youimpression of how well informed they were about America?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0801" n="Page0801"/>
                <p>LORD: I think that they were pretty well informed, considering the fact that we
                    didn't have a lot of communications with them. Some of them had made occasional
                    visits to the U.S. and so on. I don't know how to quantify this, but I think
                    that Vietnamese officials were relatively well informed about America. I think
                    that they understood the domestic political pressures on our side. They
                    certainly had to understand this, from the aggressive talking points we
                    presented on the MIAs. We always spent the first couple of hours of a meeting
                    with them on this issue alone. They understood how important this issue was for
                    us, in principle, in terms of our domestic politics, and in our being able to
                    move ahead on normalization of relations with Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Really, it was quite extraordinary to go to Hanoi, either alone or a co-leader of
                    the Presidential Commission on MIA questions, and spend three-quarters of our
                    time on the MIA issue. From the standpoint of the Vietnamese Government
                    officials we met, they were thinking about economics and geopolitics and the
                    fact that, after all, we had lost the war. They had many more missing in action
                    than we did. I'm sure that some of the Vietnamese officials were sort of puzzled
                    and others were annoyed that we should spend so much time on the MIA issue.</p>
                <p>It really got to be repetitious. We used essentially the same talking points at
                    every meeting with them. However, I think that, by virtue of our presentations
                    and, I'm sure, from their conversations with fellow Asians and fellow diplomats,
                    they gained an improved knowledge about Americans. This added to their general
                    knowledge. I feel that they understood the U.S. pretty well.</p>
                <p>Q: I would think, though, that in a way this MIA issue would be almost a freebie
                    for the Vietnamese communists. They might well say: “Sure, go ahead. Do what you
                    want.” In other words, we would make our points, and this would be something
                    going on.</p>
                <p>LORD: Well, that's right. First of all, it was quite expensive to send teams,
                    especially joint Vietnamese-American teams out into some of the remote places in
                    Vietnam to search for MIA remains. There were a lot of difficult excavations,
                    and so on. We covered the cost of those searches. Some of the more radical
                    Vietnam veterans and members of the the MIA family groups in the United States
                    thought that this was bribery. To a certain extent they were probably charging
                    us a little more than it really cost. On the other hand we thought that this
                    search was in our interest, and the cost from that point of view was legitimate.
                    We would fly helicopters out there, we would go out into remote areas and dig
                    for MIA remains, and we would use Vietnamese labor to do it. They were doing the
                    work, and they had to be compensated for it.</p>
                <pb facs="0802" n="Page0802"/>
                <p>We felt that it was in their interest to be forthcoming. Not that we trusted
                    them, but just on the basis of our pragmatic interests. If the Vietnamese wanted
                    more trade, wanted to “balance” China, and wanted to have diplomatic relations
                    with the U.S., why not be forthcoming? I think that the proof is that they got
                    more and more cooperative as we went along, because we were moving ahead in
                    developing our relationship with Vietnam. I'll get to the statistics in just a
                    minute. The fact is that we were moving ahead in our relationship with Vietnam,
                    and the Vietnamese saw that it was paying off.</p>
                <p>We never knew, of course, whether we could fully trust the Vietnamese. They
                    really had difficulty in finding records that we thought they should have. They
                    would claim that these records had been destroyed, and we thought that we just
                    had to get them to work a little harder at it. Or we'd give them more incentives
                    to deal with Vietnamese villagers and even reward people if they came in with
                    remains or information concerning American MIAs. We did that partly by giving
                    them information on their MIAs. The Vietnamese officials would claim that their
                    people would not understand why we were spending so much time on this issue and
                    why we weren't moving ahead with our relationship. They would say that this was
                    a matter of face, and all of that stuff. But in their controlled society the
                    heads of government could do what they wanted. And in many ways they had an
                    incentive to cooperate with us.</p>
                <p>Having said that, I would say that the process could be agonizingly slow at
                    times. This began to improve as we went ahead. We often wondered why the
                    Vietnamese didn't just speed things up. On the whole, I agree with your premise,
                    they had an incentive to be cooperative. We gave them that incentive through the
                    strategy we followed. Indeed, we felt, without relying on trust but on
                    self-interest as well as the testimony of our people on the ground out there,
                    that the Vietnamese were cooperating with us. Every time we went out on a
                    mission in Vietnam, we would be briefed by our teams. We had people who were
                    members of a Joint Task Force permanently stationed in Vietnam, coordinating our
                    efforts with Vietnamese officials, going out and searching for remains,
                    searching for archives and for information, and often working along the Laotian
                    border. These people, who were hard-headed American military personnel, would
                    constantly tell us and visiting Congressmen with us, visiting Vietnam veterans
                    and members of MIA family groups, who would either go with us or on their own on
                    some of these trips, that, “Yes, the Vietnamese are cooperating.”This was one of
                    the reasons why Goldberg, other American officials, and I would go back to
                    President Clinton and say that the Vietnamese officials were cooperating. It
                    wasn't just because of what we heard in our meetings with these Vietnamese
                    officials, of course, or even because of the information that we were getting.
                    Our people on the ground were very able and very dedicated, young American
                    soldiers out there, working every day with the Vietnamese officials and
                    villagers. They could really tell us whether these Vietnamese were being
                    cooperative or not. At times we would encounter some bureaucratic problems. Some
                    elements of Vietnamese society were more helpful than others. However, most of
                    them were very helpful, and the Joint Task Force continually gave us evidence of
                    efforts by the Vietnamese to be helpful.</p>
                <pb facs="0803" n="Page0803"/>
                <p>So this had an influence on our reporting, as well as the specific,concrete
                    results that we got on the MIA question.</p>
                <p>The challenge was to have enough concreteness and specificity in the criteria, so
                    that we could have some way of measuring actual progress, and not just general
                    statements like, “The Vietnamese are helping us.” On the other hand, if we got
                    too specific and said that we had to have so many sets of remains or so much
                    information, we might set unrealistic targets. We just didn't know what they had
                    and what they could get, particularly in terms of remains. So you couldn't
                    always quantify what they were doing. We had a real challenge to have enough
                    specificity to be credible, but not so much as to box us in and set up
                    yardsticks impossible to meet. I think that we handled this matter fairly
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Modern sampling techniques, particularly the use of DNA as
                        aidentifier, were really just coming into their own.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's right, and they became more and more helpful. We would dig and dig
                    in these incredibly remote and heavily forested hillsides, and DNA samples were
                    very difficult to find. Sometimes it took heroic efforts by our people, and by
                    the Vietnamese villagers as well, to conduct these searches. In the course of
                    the search they might just come up with a couple of teeth, or something like
                    that. Digging around took an extraordinary effort. The DNA samples helped.</p>
                <p>We had laboratories in Hawaii, which I often visited with the Secretary of State
                    and others when we went through Hawaii. These laboratories did the DNA work,
                    which sometimes took considerable time. They would look at the remains very
                    carefully, piecing things together.</p>
                <p>In summary, how we moved ahead was roughly as follows. Based on Presidential
                    Commission trips made by Goldberg and myself or in the course of my individual
                    trips, we reported back to the President, and the White House released a summary
                    of the findings. In 1993 we took the first step of no longer blocking or vetoing
                    support from the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the World Bank in the
                    form of loans for Vietnam. This actually was in many ways more important than
                    the bilateral trade embargo, which we still had at this point. It freed up money
                    from other countries. Up to this point we had blocked IMF and World Bank loans
                    to Vietnam. This was the first step we took in response to some progress in MIA
                    identification, which we reported back to the White House. This was in 1993, I
                    believe.</p>
                <pb facs="0804" n="Page0804"/>
                <p>I don't have the specific date in mind, but some time in 1994 we took the next
                    step and lifted our embargo on trade with Vietnam. This was another step, which
                    was also based on further progress with the MIA cases. Later in 1994 we set up
                    Liaison Offices in Washington and Hanoi, just as we had had previously done
                    years earlier with the Chinese. Up until then we had been dealing with the
                    Vietnamese in the United States, primarily through their Ambassador to the UN in
                    New York. He was very helpful. He would come down to Washington and talk to me,
                    and I would see him up there in New York. However, now we set up Liaison Offices
                    in each other's capitals. That was a major step forward, as they were de facto
                    embassies.Then, in 1995 we moved to full diplomatic relations. In one of the
                    most dramatic events in the four years I spent as Assistant Secretary, Secretary
                    Christopher made a trip to Vietnam in August, 1995, during which we raised the
                    U.S. flag at the new American Embassy in Hanoi. I'll get to this trip in just a
                    minute. Given all of the historical baggage behind it, that was quite a moment.
                    So this was the way we proceeded over a period of several years. He also visited
                    Cambodia on this trip and, along with the rest of us, was depressed once again
                    by Khmer Rouge atrocities.</p>
                <p>In each case it was like pulling teeth to get the White House oTony Lake to
                    continue the process. We sent along enough convincing reports to the President
                    by Goldberg, myself, and others - backed up, as I say, by the Pentagon and by
                    the economic agencies in Washington - to give us reasons to move ahead. Very
                    frankly, this was not an easy job. Over the years I and my colleagues had to
                    maneuver and press the White House, as well as working with Congress and the
                    family and veteran groups. It took great effort and Christopher was very
                    supportive.</p>
                <p>Secretary Christopher has characterized his trip to Vietnam in 1995 as a very
                    moving experience for him. He deserves a lot of credit for his effort in
                    accomplishing this, working in cooperation with the White House, on this whole
                    saga over a period of several years.</p>
                <p>In the course of this two-day visit to Hanoi we spent the first day essentially
                    and symbolically on the past. The second day we spent on the future. As always,
                    on the first day he met with the Joint Task Force people to see how we were
                    doing in cooperation with the Vietnamese in collecting and shipping remains and
                    developing further information on MIAs. This, of course, represented the past.
                    He participated, as I had on an earlier visit to Hanoi, in a repatriation
                    ceremony. This was a very simple ceremony at the airport in Hanoi. The
                    Vietnamese turned over to our people several coffins containing the remains of
                    deceased American military personnel, which were then loaded upon transport
                    planes and flown back to the U.S. It was one of the most moving experiences in
                    my life when I witnessed one of those ceremonies. I had the same experience with
                    Secretary Christopher as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0805" n="Page0805"/>
                <p>As I said, the MIA issue was still a high profile matter, and this took up the
                    first day of the Christopher visit to Hanoi. We then took up other issues, of
                    course, including economics, geopolitics, and so on. There were further meetings
                    with Vietnamese officials and discussions about where we could cooperate and
                    develop our bilateral relations. There were meetings with U.S. businessmen to
                    underline our economic interests in Vietnam. Raising the U.S. flag at our new
                    Embassy symbolized the beginning of a new relationship. Then Secretary
                    Christopher gave a speech at the University of Vietnam before a group of
                    Vietnamese students. He talked about the past and also about the future, looking
                    toward the next century.</p>
                <p>This was a nicely symbolic trip which was the final and major step accomplished
                    over a period of several years to normalize relations. It turned out, by this
                    time, to be very well received in the U.S., including the media, with minimal
                    criticism.</p>
                <p>During the remainder of those first four years of my service as Assistant
                    Secretary, we continued to try to flesh out that relationship with Vietnam. We
                    had Desaix Anderson, a distinguished Foreign Service Officer initially serving
                    in Hanoi as our first Ambassador. Then Pete Peterson, a former POW, went to
                    Hanoi to replace Anderson. We worked to get more information on repatriation and
                    to move on trade and the MFN [Most Favored Nation] issue, discussed geopolitics,
                    including China. We also talked to the Vietnamese about human rights. We had
                    several dialogues on this issue while I was there. These were like the human
                    rights dialogues which we had with the Chinese. They were conducted by Assistant
                    Secretary of State John Shattuck and people from his Bureau of Human Rights,
                    with other people from our bureau sitting in. These dialogues took place both in
                    Washington and in Hanoi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the subject raised of trying to take care of those who
                        had worked for us at our Embassy in Saigon and in other programs? They may,
                        perhaps, have fallen into disfavor with the new, communist leaders of
                        Vietnam or may have been imprisoned, following the fall of Saigon to the
                        communists in 1975. Was that an issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, it was, but there already was momentum on that before the Clinton
                    Administration entered office. An orderly departure program had been set up. We
                    had worked for some time under previous administrations and we continued to
                    press for people being allowed to leave Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0806" n="Page0806"/>
                <p>There were human rights problems in Vietnam. I mentioned the dialogue we had.
                    There were also some specific cases of people being held, either
                    Vietnamese-Americans or some prominent Vietnamese citizens who were being held
                    by their own government. We would raise these cases, and Congressmen or Senators
                    raised them. We made some progress on that front, but not a great deal. We would
                    also make the point that, in addition to working on MIA cases, it would help
                    them if they worked on some of these specific cases or on human rights
                    generally. We said that this would improve the climate generally for making
                    progress on trade and other relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As we were moving on these issues, what was the role of
                        SenatoHelms [Republican, North Carolina]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: It was interesting. He was among those who, you might imagine, would be
                    opposed to this. However, he never seemed to be as much out in front on this
                    issue as he was on some other issues, like abortion or the United Nations. He
                    was Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, obviously, and he was
                    generally very suspicious of Vietnam. He was generally not helpful. Senator
                    Smith [Republican, New Hampshire] and various Congressmen were much more vocal
                    on this issue, and they could count on Senator Helms' supporting them. It was
                    more Senator Smith and others that we were dealing with on a day to day basis.
                    As I have said, we had indispensable help from Senators and Congressmen who were
                    war heros or POWs.</p>
                <p>Q: Obviously, this whole opening to Vietnam was a very emotional and also a
                    political issue, one that really engaged the attention of Americans. What was
                    your impression of the Vietnamese leadership in Hanoi, when you were talking to
                    them? Did they seem to have the same...</p>
                <p>LORD: We dealt, on a day to day basis, at one level, of course. I'll get to the
                    Vietnamese leadership in a minute. The Vietnamese representative at the UN in
                    New York later came down to Washington to head up their Liaison Office. He is
                    now their Ambassador in Washington. The Ambassador and the Foreign Minister, a
                    man named Cam, were pragmatic and relatively easy to deal with, particularly for
                    Vietnamese, based on my experience during the 1970s. They were clearly
                    interested in moving ahead with the Vietnamese-American relationship, in their
                    own national interest. Therefore, they wanted to be helpful on the MIA
                    question.</p>
                <pb facs="0807" n="Page0807"/>
                <p>They would sometimes play the game that, “We have our own hard liners in Hanoi.
                    We need your help in order to satisfy them” or, “Don't press us too hard on
                    human rights. This is a sensitive issue among our leadership.” Or they would
                    say: “There's a debate in our leadership, and there are suspicions of U.S.
                    intentions. So please be careful.” They would play that game but, on the whole,
                    at this level people seemed to understand the U.S. fairly well and genuinely
                    wanted to improve our relations. I must say that we had really cordial and
                    friendly relations with some very helpful people in Hanoi, as well as their
                    representatives in Washington and New York.</p>
                <p>I would see members of the Vietnamese leadership when I was heading the
                    Presidential Commission on MIAs with Goldberg, or when I was with the Secretary
                    of State. You got different emphases from them, at one time or another. I saw
                    the Prime Minister, the head of the Communist Party of Vietnam, and the
                    President of Vietnam. The impressions we had of them would vary. If I recall
                    correctly, the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Ministers were generally more
                    pro-reform. You got the sense that they were somewhat easier to deal with and
                    friendly, whereas the head of the Party was sort of in the middle, and the
                    President was more hard line. These were people in their 70s. They clearly had a
                    personal legacy left over from the war, but we sensed no particular bitterness
                    or vitriol coming out of them. They didn't rake over old coals. Generally, they
                    were patient listeners, whether at my level or a higher level, to long
                    presentations on nothing but the MIA question. They always pledged full
                    cooperation with our efforts, sometimes noting their own MIA problems.</p>
                <p>I can't say that any of these officials were incredibly impressive, as, say, Zhou
                    En-lai had been impressive or even someone like Fidel Ramos of the Philippines
                    and other officials of a more democratic stripe. So those were my impressions of
                    them.</p>
                <p>Q: My question, beyond that, was whether dealing with United States
                    representatives seemed to stir any emotions on the part of Vietnamese
                    officials?</p>
                <p>LORD: There might have been one or two meetings where emotions of this kind would
                    pop out on occasion. I can't be specific about that, but there might have been a
                    phase of the conversation where the Vietnamese would get slightly testy.
                    However, on the whole, whether we were dealing with the Vietnamese leadership,
                    with people at my level, with the Foreign Minister, or with a few ordinary
                    Vietnamese citizens that we met, there was a remarkable lack of bitterness about
                    the past. There was a general commitment to look to the future in our mutual,
                    national interest. I had seen the same phenomenon in China, where, despite our
                    mutual hostility and isolation for two decades, there was an immediate positive
                    response to us. I got very little evidence of an adverse, emotional reaction to
                    Americans.</p>
                <pb facs="0808" n="Page0808"/>
                <p>The other interesting thing is that in the U.S. I would only occasionally see and
                    meet with Vietnamese-American representatives. While we had a lot of dealings on
                    the domestic front with Congress, with families, and with veterans
                    organizations, moving ahead with Vietnam did not seem to be a major source of
                    controversy. Normalizing relations with Vietnam did not seem to be a serious
                    issue. The Vietnamese I met in the U.S. wanted to normalize relations with their
                    country, because they felt that it was in their own self-interest to do this.
                    Another reason might have been that this might give them a chance to go back and
                    see their families in Vietnam. If they were from South Vietnam, you might have
                    expected that they might be bitter because they had worked with the U.S. and had
                    to leave Vietnam when the war ended in 1975 or 1976. Or, if they were boat
                    people, they might have left Vietnam because they were violently against the
                    communist government and were opposed to improving relations with it. But for
                    some reason the Vietnamese people who had come to the U.S. had very little
                    contact with my office or with me personally, even though obviously I was one of
                    the point men on the whole policy of improving Vietnamese-American relations.
                    They didn't play a major role in our policy. I never had the sense that one of
                    the obstacles to moving ahead, for example, would be the opinions of Vietnamese
                    who had fled their country and come to the U.S. There was much more American
                    than Vietnamese-American opinion opposed to normalization of relations. And even
                    this turned out to be modest, in part thanks to our skillful handling of the
                    issue.XXVIII. STATE DEPARTMENT ASSISTANT SECRETARY. OTHER COUNTRIES
                    (1993-1997)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, turning to the other parts of Indo-China, such
                        as Laoand Cambodia, we talked somewhat about Cambodia already.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes, let me deal with Cambodia, and then we'll discuss Laos,Burma, and some
                    other places.</p>
                <pb facs="0809" n="Page0809"/>
                <p>This is another issue, like Vietnam, that had some personal resonance with me on
                    several issues. First, in dealing with the Vietnamese negotiations in the 1970s.
                    When I worked with Dr. Kissinger, Cambodia and Laos were also on the agenda. As
                    I already mentioned, I came close to resigning from Kissinger's NSC staff over
                    the American incursion into Cambodia in the spring of 1970. Also, like every
                    human being, I was subsequently totally shocked and outraged by the Khmer Rouge
                    atrocities in Cambodia. I think that most people would agree - although, more
                    recently, Africa has had its own horrible stories in Rwanda, Burundi, and the
                    Congo - that after the holocaust of the Jews in Europe, Hitler, Stalin, and Mao,
                    the Khmer Rouge brutalities were among the worst events in the second half of
                    the 20th century. I have great respect and affection for the Cambodian people. I
                    also had Cambodia a little bit in my background because when I was Ambassador to
                    China, Prince Sihanouk spent several months out of each year living in China. I
                    used to go and call on him, just to stay in touch. The Chinese played an
                    important role in the ongoing Cambodian situation, of course, supporting
                    opposition to the Vietnamese, but this also reflected our past association. I
                    had met Sihanouk several times when I was traveling with Dr. Kissinger. For a
                    long time, he suspected that the Nixon Administration had engineered his
                    overthrow in 1970 - this was not true.</p>
                <p>So I saw Sihanouk several times in Beijing, whom I always found very interesting.
                    It was very easy to get ready for a meeting with Prince Sihanouk. You just had
                    to think of one question which you wanted to ask him. You asked the question,
                    and he would then give you an hour's monologue in reply. It would be fascinating
                    and emotional, usually high strung and fast, but it would also answer all of the
                    other questions that you might have had. Sihanouk was always polite. He spoke in
                    a very high pitched voice. When I called on Sihanouk in Beijing, when I was
                    Ambassador to China, he would always serve iced champagne and caviar. He would
                    have a little, white dog there, and I would sometimes meet his wife, Princess
                    Monique. I think that he had a special assistant, a woman who usually sat in at
                    the meetings. His rapid fire monologues were a real challenge for my note-taking
                    abilities.</p>
                <p>I always felt considerable admiration for Sihanouk. He acquired in some quarters
                    a reputation for being a buffoon because he was always changing his mind, going
                    with the wind, and switching sides. Perhaps there was an element of that even in
                    these meetings, but I felt that here was a man who was doing a balancing act but
                    who always had his country's interests at heart. He was genuinely trying to
                    ensure that Cambodia might become more peaceful and prosperous and live a more
                    democratic life. He was personally torn by his own personal angst about his
                    country, and the difficult choices he faced.</p>
                <pb facs="0810" n="Page0810"/>
                <p>On the one hand, of course, he was a fierce, Khmer nationalist who loved his
                    country and always put it first. He was always trying to figure out what was
                    best for Cambodia. Therefore, he always had natural, anti-Vietnamese instincts
                    as a Cambodian. He opposed the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1979. On the
                    other hand, he detested the Khmer Rouge, who had murdered something like 15 or
                    so members of his own family and who kept him essentially as a front for their
                    rule for seven years, during which time he was under house arrest. He was torn
                    between an intense dislike of the Vietnamese and an equally intense dislike of
                    the Khmer Rouge. He steadily searched for the best way through this thicket,
                    which involved a lot of emotional, personal, and political dilemmas for
                    him.Certainly, Sihanouk was in favor of promoting a third force, an alternative
                    to the Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese influence, that still is led by his son,
                    Prince Ranariddh, who has always been rather ineffectual and weak. So I found
                    from our conversations that Prince Sihanouk reflected this terrible agony of his
                    country and genuine patriotism. I thought he was shrewder than many people gave
                    him credit for, even as he has periodically reversed his positions. He was above
                    all a survivor. To this day, he's a force in the country.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I came to Cambodia in 1993 with some considerable historical baggage,
                    just as I had with Vietnam. Early in my tenure as Assistant Secretary of State
                    for East Asian Affairs, Cambodia was high up on my agenda. I came into office in
                    March, 1993, and the Cambodians were gearing up for elections in May, 1993. The
                    biggest peacekeeping program in the history of the UN was being implemented in
                    Cambodia at that point. The program was called UNTAC. I don't have the details
                    at my fingertips, but literally billions of dollars were being spent on a very
                    large UN presence.</p>
                <p>As I was saying, by the early spring of 1993 the huge UN operation in Cambodia
                    had succeeded in doing many things. First, violence had substantially declined
                    in Cambodia, compared to the Khmer Rouge period and even after that, when there
                    was fighting between the Khmer Rouge and other factions.</p>
                <p>Secondly, with UN help, 350-400,000 refugees, most of whom had been in Thailand,
                    had returned to Cambodia and were being resettled. Thirdly, outside influence of
                    a nefarious nature was being reduced. The Chinese were backing away from their
                    support of the Khmer Rouge. The Thai were beginning to crack down on the Khmer
                    Rouge along the Cambodian-Thai border. The Vietnamese were being generally
                    helpful. Elections were being organized in Cambodia. All in all, this was one of
                    the most successful UN operations ever.</p>
                <p>So my first task, or rather the Clinton administration's first task, on the
                    Cambodian front was to give as much support as possible to the electoral process
                    and to make sure that the elections were as fair as possible.</p>
                <pb facs="0811" n="Page0811"/>
                <p>I went to Cambodia early in my tenure as Assistant Secretary to show support for
                    this electoral process. This was only about ten days before the elections. There
                    were some outbreaks of violence and some question as to whether all of the
                    various political parties were going to participate. Some observers were not
                    sure that the elections were going to work out, even though 95 percent of the
                    people had been registered. This was quite an achievement. So I purposely went
                    there to urge all of the political parties to take part in the elections. I held
                    a press conference to show American support for this process. Even though I
                    wasn't 100 percent sure, by any means, how it was going to come out, I expressed
                    great optimism and U.S. support for this process. I said that I hoped that it
                    would be a fair election and said how meaningful this would be for the Cambodian
                    people, who had had such a tragic history.</p>
                <p>The UN operation in support of the elections was headed up by the Japanese, a Mr.
                    Akashi, who then went on to Bosnia afterwards. He did a fabulous job in
                    Cambodia. Working with him was Australian General Sanderson. Of course, I met
                    with them, as well as with others, when I was in Cambodia. In my various trips
                    to that country I met with many people, including government leaders, members of
                    various factions, representatives of non-governmental organizations and human
                    rights groups, American business people, and so forth.</p>
                <p>The elections took place in May, 1993, with 90 percent of the people voting. The
                    process was observed by international representatives and was determined to be
                    remarkably fair. The non-communist third way group, the FUNCINPEC, led by Prince
                    Ranariddh, the son of Prince Sihanouk, won a majority of the votes. FUNCINPEC
                    derived support from its link to Prince Sihanouk, whose popularity was
                    tremendous among the Cambodian people, thanks largely to Sihanouk's name
                    recognition. There was another group which had Vietnamese support, the Hun Sen
                    faction. They were relatively constructive at this point, planning for the long
                    haul. The Hun Sen faction was close to Vietnam, and Hun Sen himself was a former
                    Khmer Rouge leader. Obviously, the Khmer Rouge did not take part in the
                    election. They refused to take part in the elections and were formally banned by
                    the National Assembly in June, 1994. Hun Sen's group came in second in the 1993
                    elections. I don't have the figures, but it was roughly 60 percent for the
                    Ranariddh forces [FUNCINPEC] and 40 percent for Hun Sen and his supporters.</p>
                <p>After the elections Hun Sen began to make ominous noises, in effect saying: “I've
                    got to share power in this arrangement.” Then a decision to distribute power
                    between the leading parties was made by the UN. I have to say that we supported
                    this choice with some reservations but we thought that a power-sharing
                    arrangement was the best outcome. People now look back and say: “If Prince
                    Ranariddh won the election, we shouldn't have let Hun Sen in 'under the tent,'
                    because he was sure to muscle his way forward against the ineffectual Ranariddh
                    forces. Hun Sen didn't deserve to be part of the government chosen by the
                    election.” Furthermore, people said that the government set up after the
                    elections was something of a “Rube Goldberg” operation, with “Co-Prime
                    Ministers,” “Co-Foreign Ministers,” and “Co-Everything.”</p>
                <pb facs="0812" n="Page0812"/>
                <p>The arguments for a coalition government of this kind, and the reason that we
                    went ahead, without any illusions about the difficulty of such a coalition, were
                    that Hun Sen controlled the Cambodian Army, in effect, which clearly was a
                    stronger military force than the other military groups. Moreover, Hun Sen
                    controlled most of the government ministries. This was the situation before the
                    elections and still was the situation after the elections were held. It was a
                    very difficult situation. There was a real danger of violence and conflict
                    breaking out again. We calculated that Ranariddh had no power to enforce his
                    position, unless the UN forces would stay on in Cambodia more or less
                    indefinitely. Everybody in the UN had agreed that the UN forces had to withdraw
                    after the elections. Furthermore, Hun Sen had won between 30 and 40 percent of
                    the vote, so it wasn't as if he didn't have some popular support, whether
                    justified or not. For example, it wasn't as if he had obtained, say, only five
                    percent of the vote or less.</p>
                <p>So, with some trepidation we figured that the least bad alternative was to avoid
                    possible civil conflict, recognize that in fact the Hun Sen forces had won 30 or
                    40 percent of the vote, and that, above all, they had the muscle. Even though
                    there was a certain injustice to such an outcome, maybe this would work out.
                    There was set up a coalition government, with Prince Ranariddh “First Prime
                    Minister,” Hun Sen as “Second Prime Minister,” and the other ministries
                    similarly shared. An effort would be made to meld the armies together. If we had
                    it all to do over again, I think that we still would have done that, but,
                    considering the way it turned out, one could argue it would have been better to
                    have taken the chance of agreeing that Hun Sen and his forces should be excluded
                    from the Cambodian Government. But, I think that we would have had civil
                    conflict again at that point. These were tough choices. We didn't know at the
                    time that the Prince would be so ineffectual.</p>
                <p>Therefore, this new, strange, bifurcated government took over, with the Hun Sen
                    people pretty much in de facto charge of the administrative structure and still
                    dominant militarily, as I said. In meetings I had with the Cambodian leaders Hun
                    Sen and Prince Ranariddh would always both be there. The same thing was true if
                    I called upon the Cambodian leaders with Secretary Christopher in New York. At
                    these meetings Prince Ranariddh would do all the talking, and Hun Sen would just
                    sit there. As I said, he had been a member of the Khmer Rouge organization and
                    he had only one eye. The other eye is made of glass. He had lost one eye due to
                    an injury. Prince Ranariddh reminded me of his father, Prince Sihanouk. He had a
                    sort of high pitched voice. He was very polite and friendly but he clearly was
                    not a real heavyweight.</p>
                <p>Although Hun Sen would sit in at these meetings saying nothing, I had the feeling
                    that he didn't have to say much. He was smart enough to bide his time. I thought
                    that he was probably going to take over the government. Prince Ranariddh and Hun
                    Sen were very much an odd couple.</p>
                <pb facs="0813" n="Page0813"/>
                <p>Over the next few years we had a consistent policy of urging cooperation between
                    the factions and giving aid to Cambodia. We promoted respect for human rights in
                    non governmental organizations and the development of a civil society and the
                    rule of law. We also provided military aid to help them against the Khmer Rouge
                    and economic aid more generally. In fact, some reforms did take place. The
                    economy was making some progress, they were beginning to get some foreign
                    investment, the status of human rights was not perfect, but there were ample
                    human rights groups. The press was not entirely free, but, on the whole, was
                    fairly free, and there were a lot of newspapers and magazines. The Khmer Rouge
                    continued to be on the defensive. Refugees had been resettled. On top of this
                    was always this uneasy odd couple I mentioned, and there was an air of tension.
                    However, on the whole, they seemed to be cooperating, and making some progress
                    in the face of immense challenges.</p>
                <p>We would keep urging them to cooperate whenever it would look as if a real split
                    in the government was developing. So we just tried to make this arrangement
                    work. During this period I visited Cambodia several times, calling on Prince
                    Sihanouk and on the “Co Prime Ministers” and others. Secretary Christopher
                    visited Cambodia at the same time that he went to Hanoi in August, 1995. He also
                    met with the same Cambodians at the UN in New York. Christopher's visit to
                    Cambodia was the first by any U.S. Secretary of State since that of John Foster
                    Dulles in 1955. Christopher's visit to Vietnam was the first by any U.S.
                    Secretary of State since Secretary Rogers visited there in 1970. Of course,
                    Rogers went to Saigon, so Christopher was the first Secretary of State to visit
                    Hanoi. When I worked for Dr. Kissinger, as National Security Adviser, I went
                    with him to Hanoi in February, 1973, right after the signing of the peace
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>Phnom Penh was clearly a poor city, even compared to Hanoi. However, as I say, I
                    noted some of the progress that was being made. We had no illusions about the
                    difficulties and the continuing tension between Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen. We
                    thought that probably, at some time, Hun Sen would make his move. As I said, he
                    continued to control the ministries and the Cambodian Army pretty well, even
                    though Prince Ranariddh was the figurehead leader. However, we didn't have a
                    better solution in sight at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0814" n="Page0814"/>
                <p>Now, at the same time that we encouraged cooperation among the Cambodian leaders,
                    we gave them aid and so on. We also warned them against problems that we saw
                    arising. There was corruption, and there was increasing maneuvering by Hun Sen
                    to gain power. We urged Hun Sen to try to behave himself. There was increasing
                    pressure by the Cambodian Government on NGOs [non governmental organizations]
                    and the press. So there was a balancing act going on. Again, in our Congress and
                    in American public opinion there were some people who probably felt that we
                    should have been tougher with the Cambodians on promoting human rights, on
                    dealing with the corruption problems, and on the Hun Sen maneuvering. We liked
                    to think that we were pretty firm in saying, in effect, “If you don't cooperate,
                    you're going to lose international and U.S. aid.” We would raise these issues
                    from time to time. However, as I say, we were doing a balancing act. In fact,
                    there was no good choice there. Above all, we wanted to see the Khmer Rouge
                    wiped out. With our support, our pressure on the Thai, our dealings with the
                    Chinese, this took place over a few years. That was an important goal.</p>
                <p>To what extent should we have tried to isolate and pressure Hun Sen? Since I left
                    government service, Hun Sen has taken over the government, essentially by coup
                    d'etat. Now he has won a recent election, which was generally considered fair on
                    election day but which was stacked in advance by intimidation, murders, and
                    exiles. In the new government the “First Prime Minister” was to be Hun Sen, and
                    the “Second Prime Minister” Prince Ranariddh. The issue was whether you hold
                    your nose and try to work with Hun Sen and try to keep the coalition government
                    together and keep some pressure on him, knowing that Hun Sen is pretty brutal.
                    Under his leadership there have been some serious human rights abuses, including
                    some killings of the opposition. However, we thought that by our policy we at
                    least prevented civil conflict from breaking out again. We also knew that if we
                    wanted to isolate Hun Sen and really put pressure on him, we could expect no
                    help from ASEAN or other interested groups. We would be alone and ineffectual.
                    So we have continued to muddle through.</p>
                <p>This lack of help from others was a constant dilemma. We were constantly trying
                    to get ASEAN, Australian, and other help to make the points to Hun Sen about
                    behaving himself and to make the points to Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen about
                    corruption and human rights.</p>
                <p>Let me make one last point. As I think that I mentioned, thCambodians were very
                    helpful about the MIA question.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned that a decision had to be reached, early on in the process,
                    about what we should do. Would we support Prince Ranariddh fully, or would we go
                    for cohabitation, or however you call it? On an issue like this, I think that
                    it's interesting to follow the process. How was the decision made? Was it made
                    by you, or...</p>
                <pb facs="0815" n="Page0815"/>
                <p>LORD: First of all, it was essentially a United Nations decision. Or at least it
                    was a decision made by the countries participating in UNTAC [UN Transitional
                    Authority in Cambodia]. As I recall, the decision was unanimous among the
                    countries involved that, even though we didn't like the way Hun Sen was muscling
                    his way in, he had received some 40 percent of the vote in the election of 1993,
                    and we were going to have civil conflict, so we ought to live with this. The UN
                    certainly made that decision. Indeed, it was a UN and not a U.S. decision.
                    Obviously, having said that, I must add that we were crucial to it. But if we
                    had held out, I am not certain that we could have changed it. We would have
                    stood pretty much alone in this respect.Within our own government, I don't
                    recall the exact process. As the very least, it would have been a decision
                    approved by Secretary of State Christopher and by Tony Lake, the National
                    Security Adviser to President Clinton. I don't know whether it ever reached the
                    President. Certainly, it was the kind of key decision that would be dealt with
                    at that level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Laos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I don't have too much to say about Laos. It was rather quiet during my
                    watch. You have to have priorities, and of course you have to say about every
                    country that it's important. And Laos does have some importance, but I'm not
                    going to sit here and insult people by saying that Laos, Brunei, and Papua New
                    Guinea were our highest priorities. I visited Laos a couple of times. Since it
                    was part of the former Indochina, it had a certain resonance for me. I've
                    already mentioned that my first assignment as special assistant for Dr.
                    Kissinger was to write a paper on Laos in 1970 and this turned into a crisis
                    because of misleading information fed to me by other agencies. Like Vietnam in
                    the early 1990s, Laos had an authoritarian government and had some human rights
                    problems. However, Laos was very important to us regarding the MIA question,
                    second only to Vietnam. It was not so much the numbers of MIA cases but the fact
                    that many of the most promising ones concerned Laos, because we were getting
                    more information on those in Laos. Laos was also important in terms of the
                    narcotics traffic.</p>
                <p>So we paid some attention to Laos. I tried to get the attention of Secretary
                    Christopher and others directed to Laos, though I couldn't justify it very much.
                    I visited Laos a couple of times. I always saw the Lao Foreign Minister when he
                    was in the U.S., either at the UN in New York or in Washington. I would try to
                    get him in at higher levels of the State Department, probably at the
                    Undersecretary of State or Deputy Secretary level.</p>
                <p>We worked to improve our relations there and to increase trade and investment. We
                    didn't have the kind of embargo to deal with that we had with Vietnam. We tried
                    to get Lao cooperation on the drug program. We made fair progress with some
                    effort.</p>
                <p>On MIAs I always felt that the Lao weren't very helpful. For some reason the
                    American MIA family groups said that Laos was more helpful than Vietnam. I
                    didn't think so. Part of the Lao problem was just poverty and a lack of
                    resources.</p>
                <pb facs="0816" n="Page0816"/>
                <p>So I spent some time on Laos. I was always very courteous to them. Even before
                    Laos became a member of ASEAN, if Lao representatives were in town for whatever
                    reason, I tried to see them. Whenever Lao representatives went to an ASEAN
                    regional security dialogue, I made a particular effort to see them. However,
                    Laos was not a high priority for me. The single most important issue on the
                    agenda of contacts with Laos was MIA cooperation. We managed to improve that.
                    Often we tried that together with the Vietnamese. We did some work along the
                    Vietnam-Laos border. At one point I went to an excavation camp in that area
                    where we searched for MIA remains, working with the Lao and the Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>Laos was a secondary issue for us. We made modest progress with Laos during my
                    four years as Assistant Secretary. It wasn't on a major scale, but there was
                    some improvement on the investment front, on the MIA question, and on drug
                    cooperation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Burma?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Next to North Korea, Burma had probably the most unattractive regime in
                    East Asia. Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy,
                    had in effect won the 1990 elections, much to the surprise of the military
                    junta, which was known as the SLORC, or the State Law and Order Restoration
                    Council. Subsequent to the elections of 1990 the SLORC acted to disallow the
                    elections, and there has been tension ever since. Since then Aung San Suu Kyi
                    has been the symbol of the disenfranchised, democratic majority and the
                    repressed in Burma. The SLORC is responsible for all of the authoritarian human
                    rights abuses practiced by the Burmese Government. Burma has a very tightly
                    controlled society which, furthermore, has promoted the drug traffic and has
                    produced a lot of refugees, which has put pressure on Thailand and other
                    countries.</p>
                <p>The Burmese Government is very isolated. I believe that if you went back 30 years
                    or so, foreign observers would probably have predicted that the Burmese economic
                    situation would be one of the most promising in that part of the world. Instead,
                    the Burmese Government turned Burma into a total basket case because of their
                    mismanagement, their authoritarian rule, and the general isolation from the rest
                    of the world, part of it self-imposed.</p>
                <p>For several years China had continued to develop its relations with Burma,
                    because the Chinese leaders, of course, don't care about human rights in another
                    country. Secondly, for geographic reasons, the Chinese have sought to extend
                    their influence in Burma and eventually to gain access to a warm water port in
                    Burma. So there has been a lot of Chinese military aid extended to the Burmese
                    Government.</p>
                <pb facs="0817" n="Page0817"/>
                <p>Our interest in Burma was to see whether we could improve the human rights
                    situation and gain the Burmese government's cooperation on drugs. There was some
                    debate within the U.S. Government and within our Congress about which objective
                    should have priority. Some observers, including some Congressmen from Harlem [in
                    New York] and other places where drugs were a huge problem, consider that drugs
                    are decimating our youth. They feel that, in this case, our overriding priority
                    should be dealing with the narcotics situation. Even if it meant giving some aid
                    to the Burmese Government while holding our nose about the nature of the regime,
                    they felt that we had to do something to stem the flow of opium and other drugs
                    into the United States from Burma, which was a key supplier. I don't have the
                    figures before me now, but a huge percentage of the opium traffic in general and
                    other drugs was coming out of Burma.</p>
                <p>On the other hand the human rights groups were saying as follows: “Burma has such
                    a terrible regime. Human rights must come first, even if it means a little bit
                    less cooperation in drugs, it's worth it because to gain any cooperation on
                    drugs, you're going to lose the money anyway through corruption. Even when we've
                    tried to work with them on drugs, we haven't had much success. Frankly, the best
                    way to solve the drug problem is not to try to staunch this huge flow of drugs
                    out of Burma with efforts that are only going to be half baked, but rather to
                    change the nature of the regime so that it will be more open and less tolerant
                    of corruption and drugs. We need to get at the narcotics problem at the source,
                    so to speak, rather than tolerating with this authoritarian regime. We'll always
                    have a drug problem so long as they have that government.”</p>
                <p>We had this kind of debate going on within the U.S. Government as well. We made
                    an effort - I believe in the fall of 1993 - to see whether we could move on
                    Burma, in a way that was sort of analogous to what we were trying to do in
                    Vietnam, although it's a completely different situation in many ways. Namely, we
                    would lay out a program under which, “You do this, and we'll do that.” My
                    deputy, Tom Hubbard, went out to Burma and sat down with the Burmese
                    authorities. This was after continual negotiations within the U.S. Government
                    about what the talking points would be and what we wanted out of the Burmese
                    Government. That is, how much emphasis on human rights and how much on drugs and
                    so on.</p>
                <p>We finally settled on doing both, although the human rights dimension had a
                    slight edge over the anti-drugs program. We basically said that while we were
                    not trying to set out a specific timetable for actions and reactions, we laid
                    out some of the areas that we wanted to emphasize.</p>
                <p>Specifically, we wanted the government to free Aung San Suu Kyi or at least to
                    start a dialogue with the NLD [National League for Democracy], which was headed
                    by Aung San Suu Kyi and which had won the elections of 1990. It was prevented
                    from taking its seats in the People's Assembly that it had won. We wanted a
                    better record on human rights generally and also more aggressive efforts on the
                    drug traffic. So those were the areas that we wanted to emphasize. In exchange
                    for positive steps in these areas we could loosen up on some trade and
                    investment restrictions and upgrade our relations.</p>
                <pb facs="0818" n="Page0818"/>
                <p>We had only a Charge d'Affaires in Burma and not an Ambassador. So at some point
                    we were prepared to upgrade our relations. When I came into office as Assistant
                    Secretary, by the way, there was a debate on whether we should have an
                    Ambassador to Burma. The debate was between those who said that the only way you
                    are going to make progress with this regime is to have an American Ambassador in
                    residence who can engage the Burmese at that level. We would not be doing them a
                    favor. We have Ambassadors in a lot of countries where we don't like the
                    governments.</p>
                <p>On the other hand there were those who said that we should delay assigning an
                    Ambassador to Burma. That should be saved for leverage purposes and should be
                    used later on. In any event, if we move now, under a new American administration
                    and nominate an Ambassador when we inherited only a Charge d'Affaires from the
                    previous administration, it would look like we were rewarding an oppressive
                    Burmese Government. It's one thing if we already had an American Ambassador
                    assigned to Burma and we replaced him. However, if we only had a Charge
                    d'Affaires, why upgrade the post?</p>
                <p>So that kind of debate was taking place. I was strongly in favor of staying at
                    the charg� level and using an upgrade as a bargaining chip. This position
                    prevailed.</p>
                <p>We were getting little help from ASEAN and others in terms of pressuring Burma.
                    ASEAN didn't believe in interference generally. The Thai were concerned about
                    Burmese refugees flowing into Thailand. Several other countries were concerned
                    about drugs and wanted to work with the regime. Of course, Japan wasn't willing
                    to muscle anybody. They followed their usual approach, emphasizing trade
                    promotion. The Japanese still have these guilt feelings left over from World War
                    II on human rights and their misadventures in Southeast Asia, China, Korea, and
                    elsewhere. The Japanese were always shy on this issue, and they had their
                    commercial objectives. So while Japan held back on major aid projects because of
                    our representations, it really wasn't prepared to pressure the Burmese. So this
                    left us pretty much alone.</p>
                <p>We also made sure that we saw Aung San Suu Kyi every time we had some major
                    personality go to Burma. We made sure that we saw her, as well as the Burmese
                    authorities.</p>
                <p>In any event, laying out this plan, a kind of mini road map for Burma, really
                    didn't get us too far. We really were generally frustrated throughout the four
                    years that I was Assistant Secretary for East Asian Affairs, in terms of making
                    any major progress with Burma. But there were a couple of positive moves.</p>
                <pb facs="0819" n="Page0819"/>
                <p>On the drug side we had some activity, including some UN drug programs. We made
                    some modest gains in this respect, and some of the people concerned about drugs
                    thought that we ought to step up these efforts. However, on the whole, the
                    feeling was that most of the money the programs cost was not being well used and
                    that you couldn't make real progress with the kind of regime that Burma had.</p>
                <p>We did manage to achieve the release of Aung San Suu Kyi from prison which
                    initially gave us some hope. I forget exactly when that happened, but it was
                    probably in 1995. She was transferred from jail and put under house arrest,
                    where she wasn't able to engage in much political activity. Access to her was
                    often limited, so she really wasn't getting anywhere. We constantly supported
                    her and tried to get others to support her. We tried to get ASEAN to work on the
                    regime to have a dialogue with her, but without much success. Clearly, getting
                    her out of jail was one of our objectives. Some people felt that since the
                    Burmese had done this, for whatever reasons, they had met part of our concerns
                    and perhaps should have received a more positive response as a result of Aung
                    San Suu Kyi's release.</p>
                <p>Yes, she was released but, again, under conditions providing for tight
                    surveillance and restrictions on both her physical movement and political
                    activity. And her followers were still harassed and jailed.</p>
                <p>The other modest success was that the Burmese Government arrested one of the
                    biggest drug lords along the Thai-Burmese border. However, they then proceeded,
                    in effect, to give him a free ride and even, we think, let him continue his drug
                    trafficking, although by more indirect means. They arrested him but didn't
                    really punish him.</p>
                <p>So these were two areas where, at least superficially, it looked as if we had
                    made some progress, though we really hadn't. So the tensions continued in
                    Burmese-American relations. We continued to support arms interdiction and tried
                    to get other countries to help us, but without much success. Finally, with
                    Congress getting more and more impatient, we agreed to go along with tightening
                    sanctions against Burma in 1996, as our Congress proposed to do. We did not
                    resist this effort by Congress. We went along with increased sanctions against
                    Burma, as proposed by Congress.</p>
                <p>So that's really the Burma story. It was not a major issue. It was important for
                    human rights purposes, but we had very little leverage and very little impact,
                    with the exception of the release of Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
                <p>Q: Were there any other political personalities on the scene, apart from the
                    Burmese military and Aung San Suu Kyi, whom we were concerned about?</p>
                <pb facs="0820" n="Page0820"/>
                <p>LORD: Not really. I don't recall anyone else. There was the usual speculation
                    about who was somewhat more reasonable and who were the hard liners in the
                    regime. There was speculation about who might be somewhat more willing to deal
                    with Aung San Suu Kyi and who wanted to isolate her totally. We had some reason
                    to believe that there were some different factions, but the Burmese were never
                    really forthcoming. The collective decision of the Burmese military continued to
                    reflect a hard line.</p>
                <p>Outside the government, Aung San Suu Kyi's supporters who won the 1990 elections
                    by a landslide - many of them were harassed or imprisoned. The only other force
                    in Burma are the ethnic groups. There were a lot of ethnic insurgencies in
                    Burma, including three or four different major rebellions. The Burmese military
                    junta moved to crush and/or reconcile itself with each of these different
                    groups, to make sure that they could consolidate their power. Through military
                    pressure and some process of negotiations and bribery, they managed to stamp out
                    several of the ethnic insurgencies.</p>
                <p>Some of these groups were at least potential allies of Aung San Suu Kyi, at least
                    temporary allies of convenience with a common enemy. They might have been able
                    to weaken the Burmese Government's central control of the country, but the
                    alliance of these ethnic groups with Aung San Suu Kyi was not particularly
                    effective. As a practical matter, there was no real way that we could deal with
                    them. Some of these ethnic groups were engaged in drug trafficking, so they
                    weren't necessarily good guys either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still sticking to this general area, did Hong Kong amount
                        tanything in particular?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I can't recall how much we talked about Hong Kong in the China context.
                    This was not a major agenda item with the Chinese or British, although we were
                    concerned about the return of Hong Kong to China in July, 1997. We made clear
                    our interests in China's living up to its obligations to preserve Hong Kong's
                    autonomy. I visited Hong Kong several times and always met with Governor Patten,
                    Anson Chan, the local Chinese representative and Americans and Hong Kong
                    business leaders and Hong Kong legislators including Marin Lee, plus the media.
                    Patten, in my view, was terrific and very courageous in trying to carve out
                    political space and freedom for Hong Kong before the Chinese took over. He
                    incurred Beijing's wrath and insults by pursuing reforms that gave the Hong Kong
                    people somewhat more political clout. He was trying to make it difficult for the
                    Chinese to roll back this process after the 1997 takeover. I - and our
                    government - strongly supported Patten, who was extremely impressive. We
                    established good personal ties as well.</p>
                <p>Now let me review Mongolia briefly.</p>
                <pb facs="0821" n="Page0821"/>
                <p>I always had a soft spot in my heart for Mongolia. To the credit of Jim Baker,
                    the former Secretary of State under President Bush, he visited Mongolia twice.
                    Once he was supposed to visit there even longer and do some hunting. Then there
                    was some kind of international crisis that he had to leave Mongolia to deal
                    with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the Gulf War.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: The bad news is that I believe Baker went to Mongolia during his tenure as
                    Secretary of State twice as often as he went to Japan. He went to Japan only
                    once, I believe, which, in my view, reflects a somewhat skewed priority.</p>
                <p>Although it was obviously not at the top of my list, Mongolia aleast deserved
                    attention and sympathy for several reasons.</p>
                <p>First, it was the first Asian country to throw off the yoke of the Soviet Union,
                    in 1990 or 1991. You should remember that the Mongolian economy was about 90
                    percent dependent on the Soviet Union. So this was a courageous move for
                    Mongolia, even in that early period after the disappearance of Soviet influence
                    and empire.</p>
                <p>Secondly, the Mongolians have tried consistently now, and for several years,
                    including my term as Assistant Secretary, to promote both economic and political
                    reform. Mongolia is unlike Vietnam and unlike China, which have only gone in for
                    economic reform, and are still authoritarian in outlook. Mongolia promoted
                    democracy at the same time as they promoted opening up their society to a free
                    market, foreign investment, and trade.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, Mongolia is sitting out there between these two giants, Russia and
                    China. There is obviously a lot of romance and nostalgia and admiration for
                    these nomadic people, who have lived between these two giants. Mongolia has no
                    human rights problems. They are trying to promote democracy and the free market.
                    Not only should we have some sympathy for that, but also we believed that they
                    could establish a pattern and influence debate about what course much of Asia is
                    going to take. This concerned the issues of Asian values, authoritarianism,
                    human rights, and more political freedom. Mongolia could be an example, even
                    though a modest one given the fact that while it is a large country, it has a
                    small population of only two or three million people. A successful Mongolia
                    would show that you can have open politics, with free elections and democracy,
                    and make economic progress at the same time. The example of Mongolia could make
                    it possible to counter the Chinese argument - and the phony Asian values
                    argument - that you need stability to make economic progress with “stability”
                    translated into repressive government.</p>
                <pb facs="0822" n="Page0822"/>
                <p>So for all of these reasons, I always worked hard on Mongolia. I labored to get
                    as much aid for Mongolia as possible. Whenever a Mongolian visitor would come to
                    the UN General Assembly or would visit Washington, I would always try to make it
                    possible for him to see as high a level official as possible, like the Secretary
                    of State or the Deputy Secretary. I took two trips to Mongolia. The first trip
                    really demonstrated my commitment. I went in January-February, 1994, when it was
                    ice cold. I went out over the Gobi Desert in a helicopter. I met with all the
                    Mongolian leaders. We had some very interesting geopolitical discussions in the
                    Gobi Desert with their National Security Adviser and their Foreign Minister. I
                    was very moved by the whole experience.</p>
                <p>I went back to Mongolia in the fall of 1995 with the First Lady, Mrs. Clinton. We
                    had gone together to China for the International Women's Conference, and we went
                    off from there to Mongolia. She was also very touched by the visit. I've always
                    kept in touch with Mongolia since then. I meet periodically with their
                    Ambassadors in Washington and in New York.</p>
                <p>Afer I left government, I pressed for a time to have President Clinton stop in
                    Mongolia when he went to China, but I gave up on that after a while. I thought
                    that the symbolism of the President's visiting this neighboring democracy in
                    Asia would be impressive. (On his trip to China, President Clinton didn't even
                    go to Japan).</p>
                <p>We managed to get quite a bit of aid for Mongolia, which couldn't absorb all that
                    much. The aid was for energy and for other purposes. The total amount was
                    $10-$15 million annually. Given the shrinking AID budget and the fact that
                    Mongolia is rather distant from the point of view of an average American, we did
                    well. We emphasized to Congress that the Mongolians were trying to promote
                    freedom, as well as the capitalist system. They had no human rights abuses. They
                    had free elections. They went from a communist to a non-communist government. I
                    thought that the Mongolians really deserved our support. Several Senators
                    visited Mongolia and came back supporting an aid program for that country.
                    During the last year I was Assistant Secretary, we got more aid for Mongolia
                    from Congress than we asked for, which is almost unheard of, particularly in a
                    time of declining aid budgets.</p>
                <p>Sadly, and as we speak, Mongolia has had some real problems. A certain deadlock
                    has developed between the President of Mongolia and the Prime Minister and
                    Government. The jury is still out on what they're going to do. I spent more time
                    on Mongolia than, perhaps, many people would think that it deserved. But I had a
                    soft spot in my heart for that country, and I thought it was an important
                    example of courageous people trying to move in the right direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Should we talk about Australia and New Zealand?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0823" n="Page0823"/>
                <p>LORD: Exactly. Contacts with Australia and New Zealand are two of the easiest
                    relationships we have in terms of values, chemistry, and everything else,
                    although they presented different challenges. Australia was a solid ally, but we
                    had had a falling out with New Zealand over the question of visits of U.S. Navy
                    nuclear-powered vessels to New Zealand. This put a strain on our relations with
                    New Zealand.</p>
                <p>Let me start with Australia which, without any question, was the most trouble
                    free bilateral relationship we had in my tenure as Assistant Secretary. We
                    strengthened our relations in the course of those four years [1993-1997]. This
                    was partly because Australia had very enlightened, dynamic, and creative
                    leadership. Prime Minister Paul Keating and Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, and
                    Defense Minister Kim Beazley [all from the Australian Labor Party] were
                    extraordinarily able and friendly leaders who contributed a great deal to
                    Australian-American relations. They led an Australian Labor Party [ALP]
                    government, but this was fairly conservative leadership. It was very friendly to
                    the U.S.</p>
                <p>Our relationship with Australia during these four years was essentially a love
                    feast. We had a strong relationship between our military forces under the ANZUS
                    treaty which, in effect, is now a bilateral arrangement, since New Zealand in
                    effect has left it. There are a lot of joint defense facilities in Australia,
                    joint exercises, and training exchanges. Australia was probably the most active
                    country in Asia on human rights. They helped us a great deal in that area,
                    whereas other countries were timid and selfish. The Australians would speak up
                    to the Chinese and others on this issue. Australia played a very important role
                    in the Cambodian settlement and was very active in various aspects of Cambodian
                    diplomacy, peacekeeping, arms control, nuclear testing, and the negotiation of
                    the treaty on chemical weapons, where they took the lead.</p>
                <p>Australia was among the top promoters of APEC. In the early summer of 1993 Prime
                    Minister Keating personally helped to persuade President Clinton that he should
                    raise the APEC meeting in Seattle in November, 1993, to the summit level.
                    Although others in the U.S. Government and I myself recommended this, Keating
                    was key with the President. He was really excited about the potential of an APEC
                    grouping and an Asian-Pacific Summit Meeting for the first time in history.
                    Gareth Evans was by far the most impressive Foreign Minister that I dealt with
                    with Alatas of Indonesia and Qian Qichen of China, the other outstanding ones.
                    He was very creative, whether he was dealing with arms control, UN reform, APEC,
                    or Cambodia, or any other issues. He had more answers than there were questions.
                    Most of them were creative, good, and very helpful to the U.S.</p>
                <p>I worked hard to make sure that we had yearly Australian Ministerial Talks, known
                    as the AUSMIN Talks. This meant that the American Secretaries of State and
                    Defense met with their Australian counterparts. This practice has now fallen
                    into some disrepair. I managed to arrange for three of these meetings in my four
                    years as Assistant Secretary, both in Australia and in the U.S.</p>
                <pb facs="0824" n="Page0824"/>
                <p>One rather amusing though somewhat painful episode took place at the first
                    meeting of ministers for the regional security dialogue in the Clinton
                    Administration. I forget where it took place, to be honest, though it was
                    somewhere in Southeast Asia in July of 1993. I think that it was held in
                    Singapore, actually. Secretary of State Christopher was supposed to go on from
                    these dialogues to Australia for a visit. A crisis came up, either involving
                    Bosnia or the Middle East. Christopher had to cancel his trip to Australia and
                    come back to the United States.</p>
                <p>I had a fabulous relationship with Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans. He
                    was also known to be very testy with his staff. He would lose his temper and was
                    tough in defending his interests. On this particular occasion I had a very
                    difficult conversation with him. I had to convey the news that Secretary
                    Christopher was not going on to Australia. I was on the phone, I think, in
                    Singapore. Evans said: “Well, we've got to put out a communique, promising that
                    Christopher's coming back in a couple of months.” Evans was greatly annoyed that
                    all of this effort had been made, and now to no avail. Evans and Keating had
                    even moved the meeting place from southern Australia, in Canberra, the capital,
                    to Cairns on the northern coast of Australia to make it easier for Christopher
                    to attend the meeting, from the logistical and geographical point of view. Then,
                    two days before the visit to Australia, Christopher was canceling it.</p>
                <p>Frankly, I, too, was annoyed that this development had undercut our efforts in
                    the first year of my tenure to highlight Asia and the Pacific community. Now
                    Christopher was pulling out of this Asian meeting and skipping a visit to
                    Australia to go back to the U.S. to treat another part of the world. I thought
                    that this was terrible symbolism and was terribly uncomfortable about it.
                    However, of course, I defended the decision made by our Secretary of State. He
                    was under pressure from the White House to get back to Washington.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Gareth Evans said on the phone: “Get me an answer right away on this
                    communique” to announce the cancellation of Christopher's visit to Australia.
                    Evans used the phrase, which I gather is an Australian expression, because I had
                    never heard it before: “What you Americans are getting for me back home is a
                    'shit sandwich.'”</p>
                <pb facs="0825" n="Page0825"/>
                <p>So an angry Evans was on the phone saying: “I want your agreement to this
                    language” in a communique committing Christopher to go to Australia very soon,
                    which, after all, is a very long distance, once Christopher was back in
                    Washington, for me to promise that he was coming back to Australia in a few
                    months was not easy. However, I was pretty tough with Christopher. I said: “This
                    really hurts us with the Asians and with Australia. The least you can do is to
                    promise that you will reschedule the trip to Australia.” I distinctly remember
                    having Gareth Evans on the phone, shouting at me: “Get Christopher's agreement
                    right away,” so, in effect, I literally put Evans on hold, walked down the hall
                    in the hotel in Singapore to Christopher's room, and got his agreement to
                    reschedule the trip to Australia. By this time Christopher was getting annoyed
                    with Evans and his insistence on his coming out to Australia. However, I thought
                    that the Australians were essentially correct on this. So I got Christopher's
                    agreement to rescheduling the trip and went back and talked to Evans.</p>
                <p>Ever after that Evans and I used to joke about this, although it was painful for
                    me at the time. I remember once when I went in to see Evans in his hotel room at
                    some international conference. I arranged to see him on some bilateral matters.
                    Evans had a plate of hors d'oeuvres sitting there with drinks. I sat down and
                    purposely sort of picked around the hors d'oeuvres and said: “Excuse me, Gareth,
                    I'm trying to find the 'shit sandwich.'”</p>
                <p>So the subjects we discussed with Australia were UN peacekeeping, various
                    regional conflicts, and issues like Cambodia, relations with key Asian countries
                    like China and Japan, open trade, progress toward free trade, lifting APEC to
                    the summit level, forceful and regional security dialogues, always being
                    forthcoming and trying to move these dialogues along, while taking on the
                    Chinese and others, environmental and non-proliferation issues. These
                    discussions with Australia really reflected dream relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0826" n="Page0826"/>
                <p>Interestingly enough, Australia was the one country in Asia with which we had a
                    trade surplus. Indeed, the Australians used to point out that, in terms of the
                    percentage of trade, their deficit with us was bigger than our trading deficit
                    with Japan. I remember the first AUSMIN meeting, because it was in March, 1994.
                    It involved bringing Secretary Christopher to Australia as well as Perry. This
                    was on the way to the terribly difficult Christopher trip to China, when the
                    Chinese had locked up dissidents.Anyway, I remember this AUSMIN trip for that
                    reason. When we got to Australia, we had terrific meetings of Defense and State
                    Department representatives. We agreed on just about everything. However, at that
                    point, as I've said elsewhere, we were having difficulties both in our Chinese
                    and Japanese relationships. With China, because of human rights and the MFN
                    issues. With Japan, because of trade disputes - Mickey Kantor, the U.S. Trade
                    Representative, took on Japanese Prime Minister Hashimoto and others, and so on.
                    Even though Evans and Keating and the Australians in general were very high on
                    human rights and democracy, they didn't think that we ought to link them with
                    trade and MFN with China. They also didn't think that we should be getting into
                    a big battle with Japan, particularly when it looked, as a result of our poor
                    public relations that we were in favor of managed trade, while Japan was in
                    favor of freer trade. This of course turned upside down our two countries'
                    positions.</p>
                <p>I mention all of this, because when we came out for a joint press conference with
                    Foreign Minister Evans and Secretary of State Christopher, as often happens, the
                    media focused on the one problem area. 99 percent of our agenda and meetings had
                    been positive. We had a tremendous communique. We had agreed to cooperate on all
                    of these regional and global issues. However, Evans got one or two questions on
                    Japan and China. He took a whack at U.S. policy, and that just dominated the
                    entire media coverage in Australia and the U.S. coverage of the meeting. So it
                    looked as if we had had poor meeting whereas, in fact, we had had a fabulous
                    meeting. This was really unfair and the media often do that - bad news is more
                    news than good news.</p>
                <p>Secretary Christopher was annoyed at that, including Evans' role, although you
                    can't really blame Evans for giving an honest answer and then having the
                    Australian press totally dominated by it. The press likes to fasten on
                    differences between countries. We had such a love match with the Australians on
                    all of these issues that it was almost boring. It was unfortunate that such a
                    successful visit was marred by this media slant. Not to mention the fact that we
                    were all preoccupied by the upcoming Christopher visit to China.</p>
                <pb facs="0827" n="Page0827"/>
                <p>Although Secretary Christopher began to appreciate Gareth Evans more, there is no
                    question that the “chemistry” between the two of them was not exactly perfect.
                    Christopher is a very decent guy, very reserved and somewhat shy. He is very
                    professional, with little flair. Conversely, Evans is a big talker, loquacious,
                    full of ideas and full of himself. He can be very “straightforward” in his
                    language. As I said, he has more answers than there are questions. Christopher
                    found him a little self-satisfied and overbearing at times. I'm sure that Evans
                    found Christopher a little on the dull side at times. However, I think that this
                    relationship improved over time, particularly when Christopher saw how helpful
                    Evans was on so many problems. But the two personalities never meshed. In all,
                    our relationship with Australia during this period was a very happy story. There
                    isn't much else to say about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that Australia might be ahead of us
                        aregards human rights in Indonesia, for example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: It's interesting that you mentioned this. After all, Indonesia is a very
                    important issue for Australia. Both Australia and New Zealand have been very
                    heavily involved in Indonesia, in Papua New Guinea, and the South Pacific.
                    Australia used to consider Indonesia as one of its potential security
                    problems.</p>
                <p>Australia has had a long and extensive relationship with Indonesia. It was
                    important to them. Australia took a balanced view on human rights in Indonesia,
                    for the same reasons that we did. Australia was concerned about human rights,
                    and they are very pro-democracy. They also recognize the importance of
                    Indonesia, the fact that Indonesia was making progress economically, and all of
                    the other, positive things I mentioned earlier about Indonesia's regional and
                    global role, as well as its moderate Muslim approach.</p>
                <p>So, although Australia was helpful and would talk about East Timor and human
                    rights, as we did, and was probably more helpful than any other country in Asia
                    in this respect, Australia was certainly not more forceful than we were or out
                    in front of us on that issue. As I said, Australia was helpful on human rights
                    with the Chinese, even though sometimes it cost them. It was helpful on
                    Cambodia, and on all of these other issues. However, I wouldn't say that they
                    were more forceful than we were. Just that they looked better than any other
                    Asian country. They were in the habit of being helpful to us.</p>
                <pb facs="0828" n="Page0828"/>
                <p>Also, another thing that the Australians were doing, which I clearly understood
                    and had no problem with, was that they were trying to become more of an Asian
                    country. Of course, they had started out with an almost undiluted, heavy,
                    British background. So they looked to England and Europe and the Commonwealth in
                    general until recent years. Then they shifted in their trade patterns, their
                    alliances, their interests, and influence. They looked more to the United
                    States, which is now a major influence on Australia. Now Australia, when I was
                    in office, also wanted to be seen more as Asians than Europeans. They were
                    excluded by Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia from his EAEC [East Asian
                    Conference] concept, which made the Australians (and New Zealanders) mad because
                    they thought that they should be accepted as Asians.</p>
                <p>Australian trade patterns were beginning to be more with Asia and not just with
                    the U.S. and Europe. They were a leader of APEC and pushed regional security
                    dialogues. Japan was key to them. So was Indonesia. Australia had loosened up on
                    its immigration policies, with the result that more Asians were coming to
                    Australia. They played a major role in Cambodia. They were part of the five
                    power defense arrangement. They played a major role with the South Pacific
                    nations. So what Prime Minister Keating and Foreign Minister Evans were trying
                    to do was to try to identify Australia more and more with Asia, without losing
                    their close relations with the U.S. We did see any conflict here. We understood
                    this rationale.</p>
                <p>That's why Australia placed such major emphasis on APEC and the regional security
                    dialogues and why they wanted to get into the EAEC if there was going to be one.
                    They thought that they (and New Zealand) were being kept out of the EAEC by
                    Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia on racist grounds. They were regarded by
                    Mahathir as white Caucasians, as were the New Zealanders. The Australians would
                    say that Mahathir would let the South Koreans, the Japanese, and the Chinese
                    into the EAEC, but not the white man.</p>
                <p>The Australians were trying to reorient the direction of their relations without
                    in any way denigrating their ties with the U.S. We understood that, for economic
                    and other reasons, they had to take on a more Asian coloration. Shall we go on
                    to New Zealand?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Regarding New Zealand, this is certainly not a major issue, but, again, at
                    the risk of sounding immodest, just as in the case of Vietnam, I would say that
                    in terms of my own personal impact, and maybe because this was a more modest
                    issue, I think that I had the central role on our relations with New Zealand.
                    And that I was key in modifying our policy. The New Zealanders themselves
                    recognized this.</p>
                <pb facs="0829" n="Page0829"/>
                <p>Going back about a decade, New Zealand had refused to allow U.S. Navy ships to
                    visit New Zealand unless we declared that they were not carrying nuclear
                    weapons. We had a global policy of neither confirming nor denying whether
                    nuclear weapons were aboard U.S. Navy ships visiting foreign ports. You could
                    always tell whether the ships were nuclear-powered, but the issue was whether
                    they were carrying nuclear weapons. Some of our ships carried nuclear weapons
                    and some didn't. However, if we allowed New Zealand to insist that we reveal
                    whether a ship carried nuclear weapons, every other country would want us to do
                    that or put us under political pressure to do that. This would severely
                    constrain our global, naval policy and the ports our Navy ships could visit.We
                    had a tricky, ambivalent position on this with Japan as to whether we had
                    nuclear weapons on our ships. The Japanese really never asked us, following a
                    policy of “Don't ask, don't tell.”</p>
                <p>After all, New Zealand was part of an alliance with the U.S., called ANZUS
                    [Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S.]. There were alliance obligations. This
                    should have been a tougher issue for Japan - with its nuclear history - than New
                    Zealand. I was out of U.S. Government service at the time, but agreed with a
                    tough U.S. response to New Zealand's port call policy. If they wouldn't let our
                    Navy ships visit their ports, when we were helping to protect them as an ally,
                    there wasn't much purpose to this alliance.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Australia, at some domestic political cost - although it was not great
                    - was holding the line and not insisting on our stating whether U.S. Navy ships
                    carried nuclear weapons. Australia felt that New Zealand should not be allowed
                    to act differently. In fact, Australia felt that, de facto, New Zealand was not
                    in the ANZUS alliance if it would not fulfill alliance responsibilities. So I
                    was always for a pretty tough response to New Zealand's nuclear policy. And when
                    we came into office, New Zealand was in fact in a much lesser category, as it
                    should be, than Australia. This concerned relative sharing of intelligence,
                    military technology, military exercises, and levels of contacts.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, this was the only problem that we had with New Zealand. New
                    Zealand was extremely helpful on UN peacekeeping, free trade, regional security,
                    and many other issues. Therefore I thought our policy had reached an egregious
                    level of shunning New Zealand in diplomatic terms. We were treating New Zealand
                    worse than some really unattractive regimes around the world. To take the
                    clearest example, when I came into office as Assistant Secretary, the U.S. did
                    not authorize any New Zealand dealings between the State Department and the
                    Pentagon and their Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry above my level. That
                    is, above the Assistant Secretary level. At the same time dictators,
                    unattractive people, from unfriendly countries were seeing the President and the
                    Secretary of State, even the Secretary of Defense.</p>
                <pb facs="0830" n="Page0830"/>
                <p>So it was my feeling from the beginning that we should find a way to be much more
                    friendly with New Zealand but not reward them for their nuclear policy. So the
                    first principle that we followed throughout was always to coordinate carefully
                    with Australia whatever we did with New Zealand. We didn't want to punish the
                    faithful Australia by giving New Zealand anything that looked as if New Zealand
                    was being rewarded or that we had forgotten New Zealand's nuclear policy, while
                    Australia was faithful to our alliance. So we wanted to make sure that Australia
                    was comfortable with any improvement in our relations with New Zealand. Out of
                    principle, we didn't give Australia any absolute veto on our relations with New
                    Zealand, but we didn't want to jeopardize our very strong and much more
                    important relationship with Australia for New Zealand's sake.</p>
                <p>To my pleasure, the Australians not only didn't object to our improving our
                    relations with New Zealand, they encouraged us to improve that relationship,
                    primarily because they were worried about New Zealand's fading defense
                    capability and a declining defense budget. The Australians generally wanted the
                    New Zealanders to feel less isolated. They felt, and we felt, that New Zealand
                    should not be treated as full allies again, that we should draw a line, but that
                    we should be much friendlier.</p>
                <p>So what we did was to devise a policy under which we would increase the level of
                    our contacts with New Zealand to reflect a relationship with a very friendly
                    country. We would still draw a line between that and New Zealand's being an
                    ally. We would not let them back into ANZUS officially. We would treat New
                    Zealand differently from Australia, in the sense that we wouldn't sell New
                    Zealand certain advanced, military equipment; we wouldn't participate with New
                    Zealand in joint military exercises, and there was some intelligence that we
                    wouldn't share with New Zealand that we did with Australia. My staff and I
                    prepared policy papers and began to press changes with our supervisors.</p>
                <p>Over time, we were able to make some changes in policy. Here the Pentagon was the
                    most cautious, the White House was relatively neutral, and the State Department
                    was in favor of an improvement in relations with New Zealand. New Zealand was
                    already very friendly toward the U.S. They were very free trade oriented. They
                    had a positive position on human rights and were a democracy. We had good
                    economic relations, although trade was not huge, given their population of about
                    3.5 million. They provided troops for UN peacekeeping missions. So here was a
                    very positive, constructive country, sharing our values, with this one
                    problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0831" n="Page0831"/>
                <p>To initiate a new policy toward New Zealand, my staff and I had to work quite
                    hard, both within the Department of State and with other U.S. Government
                    agencies. We reached agreement to high level visits by senior U.S. officials and
                    some limited sharing of intelligence, where it served international purposes,
                    for example, on Bosnia where New Zealand had deployed peacekeepers. It made
                    sense to share intelligence information which would help New Zealand and its
                    peacekeepers in Bosnia. But we still wouldn't share other information of a
                    strictly bilateral nature. We also held back on military sales of a certain
                    kind. So we managed to upgrade our relations and to share intelligence, even as
                    we told the New Zealanders that they should change their nuclear policy. We said
                    that they had to amend it if we were going to have a full-blown and friendly,
                    allied relationship once again. All of this was done in close consultation, and
                    full backing from, Australia.</p>
                <p>Policy on nuclear weapons was a very sensitive domestic issue in New Zealand. The
                    opposition Labour Party, was strongly against any relaxation of the ban on the
                    introduction of nuclear weapons in New Zealand, but there were those in the New
                    Zealand Government, like Prime Minister Jim Bolger and Deputy Prime Minister and
                    Foreign Minister Don McKinnon - both extremely able and friendly to the U.S. -
                    who wanted to move at least part way on this issue. There were two questions:
                    nuclear weapons and nuclear propulsion. The New Zealand Government had made a
                    study a couple of years previously which declared that nuclear propulsion was as
                    safe as conventional propulsion. Therefore, this study concluded that nuclear
                    propulsion should no longer be an issue. We were hoping that the New Zealand
                    Government could at least amend that aspect of its policy, if not the nuclear
                    weapons aspect. We couldn't make any immediate progress on the nuclear weapons
                    aspect, but we hoped that Bolger and McKinnon would work on public opinion and
                    that if our regular, bilateral relationship which featured our new policy of
                    higher-level contacts improved, and New Zealand looked less like it was being
                    ostracized, perhaps public opinion in New Zealand would evolve. Then we could
                    also move on the nuclear weapons issue as well.</p>
                <p>Throughout, Prime Minister Bolger and Foreign Minister McKinnon made clear that
                    movement on the nuclear weapons issue was always going to be tough and would
                    have to be done gradually. They didn't promise anything soon on this front.</p>
                <pb facs="0832" n="Page0832"/>
                <p>Well, as it turned out, the New Zealand Government was never able to take really
                    meaningful action in this connection, despite a lot of intensive dialogues.
                    However, we felt that it was in our interest anyway to go ahead with higher
                    level contacts. I believe these high level contacts strengthened their already
                    good cooperation in many fields. They may have had this orientation anyway but
                    they consistently helped out whenever we asked them for help on peacekeeping.
                    They sent a token naval force to the Gulf, they helped out in Bosnia, and, I
                    think, in some other places. They continued their constructive policies in APEC,
                    in the regional security dialogues, and in connection with free trade. They were
                    very helpful. I think that the consultative visits at higher levels helped to
                    promote this process of mutual interaction. So that was our payoff, with the
                    hope that over time they could move on the nuclear issue. Meanwhile, we
                    continued to treat Australia, correctly, as a first class ally.</p>
                <p>I visited New Zealand a couple of times on my own. I got Strobe Talbot, the
                    Deputy Secretary of State, to go there. We welcomed their Deputy Prime Minister
                    and Minister of Foreign Affairs McKinnon for official visits to the U.S. We
                    gradually upped the ante. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff finally
                    visited New Zealand, as did other service chiefs, not to mention trade
                    ministers. Finally, as a capstone, in 1996 Prime Minister Bolger came to the
                    U.S. on an official State Visit to Washington.</p>
                <p>During all of this time we tried to get the New Zealand Government to move on
                    nuclear weapons. Frankly, although the New Zealand Government wanted to do this,
                    there wasn't much that they could do. This wasn't an excuse for them. There just
                    wasn't the necessary political support which would have permitted them to do
                    this. We thought that it was an end in itself to do what we were doing, though
                    we continued to prohibit military exercises, the sale of some military
                    equipment, and the provision of certain kinds of intelligence. We left those
                    issues to be resolved when New Zealand cooperated fully on the nuclear weapons
                    question.</p>
                <p>One personal note is that I'm a tremendous sports fan. When I went to New Zealand
                    on my own, I was taken personally by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
                    McKinnon to a rugby game, which is very popular in New Zealand. Their national
                    team is called the “All Blacks.” They were playing the South Africa team in a
                    major match. They knew how enthusiastic I was about rugby. I went out on the
                    field after the match, kicked a field goal through the uprights, just for the
                    hell of it, in the rain. We had a lot of fun doing it. I made sure our embassy
                    leaked my exploits to the press. A picture of this event was on the front page
                    of one of the newspapers on the next day. They had my picture in the newspaper,
                    saying that this was the first goal that the State Department had kicked in New
                    Zealand for many years!</p>
                <pb facs="0833" n="Page0833"/>
                <p>To make a long story short, Prime Minister Bolger came on a state visit to
                    Washington in 1996. He is now New Zealand Ambassador to the United States. I
                    just talked to him the other day. After the state dinner at the White House, he
                    hosted a return dinner in his embassy. Vice President Gore was present. After
                    the exchange of toasts between the Vice President and the Prime Minister, to my
                    astonishment Bolger said: “I have one other announcement to make.” He then got
                    up and paid tribute to me, personally, for what I had done to improve U.S.-New
                    Zealand relations. He then presented me with a tee-shirt worn by the “All Black”
                    New Zealand rugby team and signed by every member of the team, which I, of
                    course, framed and hung in my office. I was very proud of that.</p>
                <p>That improvement in relations with this friendly country was a very satisfying
                    achievement, if not exactly of cosmic importance. It was a source of
                    satisfaction to improve the U.S.-New Zealand relationship and bring it up to the
                    level they deserved, given their friendliness and their help, but still
                    reserving parts of it until they shape up on the nuclear weapons issue.</p>

                    limbo. I think it's not in force but it's in limbo. I don't know what the exact
                    legal term would be. I don't know what you'd have to do to revive it. I don't
                    think that that's going to happen in the near future. I don't see New Zealand
                    changing its mind on the nuclear question.</p>
                <p>Q: My understanding is that during the immigration from England, New Zealand got
                    some of the most virulent left wing Labourites. I believe that they have seized
                    on this issue.</p>
                <p>LORD: You said “immigration.” Do you mean that it was that recent?</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: I didn't know that. I never heard that.</p>
                <p>Q: I heard an Australian Ambassador describe the status of the ANZUS Treaty by
                    saying that Australia was concerned that New Zealand had gotten too many old
                    Labourites from Great Britain.</p>
                <pb facs="0834" n="Page0834"/>
                <p>LORD: I never heard that. One last word on New Zealand, I've been granted but
                    haven't been able to take it up yet, the John F. Kennedy Fellowship for
                    allegedly distinguished Americans who worked to improve U.S.-New Zealand
                    relations. My wife, Bette, and I have been invited to visit New Zealand for two
                    weeks and talk to all sectors of society, give speeches and so on. This
                    fellowship was set up by the New Zealand Government after the assassination of
                    President John F. Kennedy. Among others who have been awarded this fellowship
                    but haven't been able to take it up is Retired General Colin Powell.</p>
                <p>The only thing I have left to cover is the South Pacific Islanterritories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Are you satisfied with my discussion of Australia and NeZealand?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Obviously, no one's going to pretend that the South Pacific Islands are the
                    most important part of our relationship, either. However, we did feel that they
                    had some importance, so I gave them some time.</p>
                <p>First, most of these territories are democracies. Secondly, there still is some
                    residual, strategic significance about them, not that we have any bases there,
                    but we are at least denying others the possibility of having bases there.
                    Thirdly, there are some important resources there, such as fisheries. They are
                    relevant to environmental issues, particularly coral reefs in the context of
                    global warming, which, if it gets too serious, could swamp some of these
                    territories. Fifthly, there are a lot of these territories, therefore, when we
                    try to win UN votes, it is important to have them friendly and voting on our
                    side, This can be of significance to the U.S.</p>
                <p>The Fijian, Micronesian, and the Cook Islands vote are as important as those of
                    England, Russia, or China, except that they are not on the Security Council.</p>
                <p>So, for all of these reasons we felt that we had to pay some attention to the
                    South Pacific territories, though we had no illusions that we could pay a great
                    deal of attention to them, both because of their small size and because of the
                    tremendous distances involved. It didn't take much effort for me to show much
                    more interest than my predecessors had done. I don't criticize them. Everyone
                    has to have priorities. But I made it a habit to attend every year, at my level,
                    what is called the South Pacific Forum.</p>
                <pb facs="0835" n="Page0835"/>
                <p>Once a year there is a Summit Meeting of all of the South Pacific nations, also
                    attended afterwards by outside powers with an interest in the region. After the
                    South Pacific countries have their own, internal meeting, they meet for a
                    dialogue with the outsiders. It is like the ASEAN countries; after they have
                    their meeting, they meet with powers from outside their region. For the South
                    Pacific Forum, hese outside powers include Australia and New Zealand and also
                    Japan, the EU [European Union], China, the United States, and maybe one or two
                    other countries.</p>
                <p>So, even though it was a long distance away from the U.S., I made an effort to go
                    to these meetings each year. One of these meetings was held in Brisbane,
                    Australia; one in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea; another one was in Majuro, the
                    capital of the Marshall Islands.</p>
                <p>I also visited Papua New Guinea in its own right. When I went to Brisbane,
                    Australia, I went on to Papua New Guinea, not realizing that the South Pacific
                    Forum was going to be in Papua New Guinea the following year. Two trips to Papua
                    New Guinea were more than I needed. I should have chosen more carefully. But
                    Papua New Guinea is the most important country among the South Pacific nations.
                    I also went to Fiji on another trip. So I did some visiting in the area for the
                    reasons I've mentioned.</p>
                <p>We emphasized trade and investment in some of our cooperation programs. I managed
                    to bring with me a Department of Commerce representative and often got others to
                    go with me to the South Pacific Forum. For example, I brought an environmental
                    specialist. I once had a briefing conducted by an official from the National
                    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] of the Department of Commerce on
                    the “El Nino” phenomenon and its impact on the South Pacific. I think that those
                    attending the South Pacific Forum appreciated the effort I had made. The purpose
                    of these efforts was to show the flag and encourage some additional
                    investment.</p>
                <p>As I said, Papua New Guinea is the biggest South Pacific country. It is a very
                    tough place to visit. It has a lot of crime and is very poor. There is an
                    internal problem on Bougainville Island, which the Australians and New
                    Zealanders are trying to help them solve.</p>
                <p>Fiji is also very interesting, not to mention beautiful. One thing we did there,
                    with the help of a good political Ambassador, was to help them behind the scenes
                    to revise their constitution and help the ethnic Indians to play a more equal
                    political role with the indigenous Fijian people.</p>
                <p>I would meet with these people in New York and at the UN General Assembly. It was
                    a modest effort but, I think, it was appreciated by those countries.</p>
                <p>Q: One of our policies at one point, when the Soviet Union was still intact, was
                    to try to deny these islands to the Soviet fleet, including fishing vessels.
                    When the Soviet Union disappeared, it took another one of those points from our
                    attention.</p>
                <pb facs="0836" n="Page0836"/>
                <p>LORD: You're absolutely right. We had another problem. During this period, and it
                    has improved somewhat since I left the Department of State, there was a budget
                    squeeze on the Department and foreign affairs agencies generally. This affected
                    AID [Agency for International Development] Missions and the USIA [United States
                    Information Agency] as well. I was constantly trying to head off reductions in
                    our diplomatic, commercial, and USIA presence in the region. Although I was able
                    to prevent more serious damage, the fact is that we closed down some of our
                    posts in the South Pacific region, both commercial and diplomatic. This was
                    cutting across my symbolic effort to show that we really cared about those
                    countries. We didn't have a very strong hand to play. AID levels were down. Our
                    presence there was sufficiently poor that it was hard to promote investment.</p>
                <p>I'm not claiming any major breakthroughs, but I think that we showed a moderate
                    amount of interest. I'm happy to say that my successor as Assistant Secretary
                    has kept up this effort as well.</p>
                <p>Also, by attending conferences of the South Pacific Forum it gave me a chance to
                    have a lot of bilateral meetings at the same time. This is always an advantage
                    in these regional groupings. You can meet around the edges of the conferences,
                    at mealtime, and so forth. Outside the formal meetings you can have bilateral
                    meetings. I could see Japanese, Chinese, Europeans, Australians, and New
                    Zealanders outside these meetings.XXIX. STATE DEPARTMENT ASSISTANT SECRETARY -
                    REGIONAL AND FUNCTIONAL ISSUES (1993-1997)</p>
                <p>What I have to cover now are a couple of functional matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask you about APEC, mutual defense, and
                        Asiavalues. I think that we can also cover a couple of other matters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Some of this I have touched on tangentially already, but let mgo now to
                    APEC and then regional security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what APEC stands for and how it came to
                        be?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0837" n="Page0837"/>
                <p>LORD: APEC stands for the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. It is,
                    perhaps, the most awkward name ever devised. The word “Forum” is usually
                    dropped, so just call it APEC. It's a trans-Pacific operation which had been
                    started a few years earlier. I believe that the first meeting of the group took
                    place in Australia, and some of the other, early meetings took place in Seoul
                    [South Korea] and elsewhere. It was designed to promote freer trade and
                    investment in the Pacific area. It included the major countries of the
                    Asia-Pacific area, plus the United States and Canada. Under a compromise that
                    had been worked out a few years earlier in Seoul it also included both Taiwan
                    and China. It's one of those organizations which didn't require statehood to be
                    a member, like the UN. Rather, one could become a member of APEC if it were a
                    recognized, economic entity. Given Taiwan's economic importance, the Chinese
                    allowed Taiwan in, although there was constant fighting about how much influence
                    Taiwan could have, at what level, and so on. Hong Kong was also a member.</p>
                <p>When the Clinton Administration came into office, there had been a lot of
                    “alphabet soup” going on in the Pacific area, including economic and other
                    organizations. Even I can't remember all of the initials, but there was the
                    Pacific Basin Economic Council and a couple of others. Some of them were
                    strictly to promote trade and investment. Others were think tanks, and there was
                    a whole bunch of organizations. However, this seemed to be easily the most
                    promising to us. It always met at the foreign minister and trade minister
                    level.</p>
                <p>We decided, and I highlighted this also in my confirmation statement, that in
                    striving to elevate Asia in our foreign policy agenda and to build
                    incrementally, with others, a Pacific Community we would blend both bilateral
                    and regional approaches to Asia. If it were a matter of defense, this obviously
                    meant maintaining our bilateral relationships and alliances but also promoting a
                    regional security dialogue.</p>
                <p>For example, if we were concerned about Korea, we would wind up not only
                    promoting bilateral talks between both North and South Koreans but also four
                    power talks, including China and the U.S. If it was APEC, we wanted to pursue
                    trade and investment bilaterally, but we also wanted to use APEC for trade and
                    investment liberalization. Often, it's easier to encourage countries to open up
                    if there is collective pressure, not to mention incentives, than if it was just
                    a bilateral meeting with another country. We thought that, over time, whether it
                    was Japan, China, or whoever else where we had trade problems, not only would we
                    negotiate with them bilaterally but we also hoped that the collective
                    commitments and pressures toward freer trade in the area would work on these
                    countries as well and help us to open them up. In this way we wouldn't have to
                    do all of the heavy lifting by ourselves, even as we hoped that the GATT
                    [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] and then the WTO [World Trade
                    Organization] would help on a global basis.</p>
                <pb facs="0838" n="Page0838"/>
                <p>We also saw APEC as being important because it included the U.S. and Canada.
                    Therefore, it was trans-Pacific in character and would tend to head off regional
                    blocs limited to Asia only, including the EAEC [East Asian Economic Caucus].
                    However, one of the debates about trade policy concerns whether it is dangerous
                    to have a regional organization like APEC, or one like NAFTA [North American
                    Free Trade Area] tending to promote trade within blocs, as opposed to a global
                    approach to trade, under the GATT and now the WTO. The fact is that these two
                    approaches are not mutually inconsistent. We always referred to APEC and the
                    North American Free Trade Association as leading toward or at least promoting
                    global trade liberalization, not as regional trading blocs as such.</p>
                <p>Indeed, we used movement on trade and investment in APEC, as I'll mention in a
                    minute, as an inducement to the Europeans to be more reasonable in GATT and in
                    the Uruguay Round. It also helped to spur progress in the Western
                    Hemisphere.</p>
                <p>So we had the fortunate calendar timing that I mentioned earlier. There were 15
                    members of APEC when the Clinton administration entered office. The host country
                    for these meetings rotates every year. It just so happened that in the first
                    year of President Clinton's first term, the U.S. was the host country. Even as
                    the G-7 [meeting of the largest industrial countries] had taken place in Tokyo,
                    when there was a one out of seven chance that the G-7 meeting in its first year
                    would be held in Asia. We used that to promote the Pacific community right off
                    the bat in the Clinton administration. So the U.S. was the host nation for APEC
                    in 1993, and the meeting was held in Seattle. This provided an opportunity to
                    put Asia on the map in our foreign policy, public consciousness, and also in
                    Asia's perception of American priorities.</p>
                <p>Later in the game, and with the support of Prime Minister Keating of Australia,
                    President Clinton and the White House agreed, roughly in June or July, 1993, to
                    raise APEC to the Summit Level at the meeting scheduled to be held in Seattle,
                    Washington, in November. This would be the first ever summit meeting of
                    Asia-Pacific powers, in and of itself important. We would give APEC more
                    visibility. We would increase the pressure on the various bureaucracies to come
                    up with meaningful arrangements to make progress for their leaders. It would
                    give political impetus from the top on trade and investment, and not just at the
                    ministerial level. This would help to anchor the U.S. in the Pacific area. It
                    would show Presidential leadership, particularly on an issue like international
                    trade, which was very important to our domestic economy and increasing our
                    exports. And it would mean that every year the President would meet with
                    Asian-Pacific heads of government, usually traveling to the region.</p>
                <p>President Clinton had based his campaign on the slogan, “It's the economy,
                    stupid.” So it all played into Clinton's domestic priorities. Clinton was very
                    conversant and comfortable with trade and economic matters, unlike with some
                    other, foreign policy issues on which he had very little experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0839" n="Page0839"/>
                <p>For all of these reasons we promoted lifting the APEC meeting to the Summit
                    Level. It's one of the best things we ever did. It meant a huge challenge for
                    our Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, with 15 heads of state or
                    government coming to the U.S. There was an awful lot of agenda items to prepare
                    for, and to coordinate with the White House, with the U.S. Trade Representative,
                    the Department of Commerce, and the Treasury Department. There was the whole
                    scheme, with all of the separate bilateral meetings, plus all of the other
                    paraphernalia of a Summit Meeting.</p>
                <p>The meeting was held in Seattle, of course, on the other side of the American
                    continent, involving not only heads of state and governments, but economic and
                    foreign ministers, with all of the schedules, logistics, and preparations
                    required. With the great help of my principal deputy, Peter Tomsen, we put
                    together a major task force in the Department of State and practically
                    coordinated for the whole U.S. Government a large part of the substance of the
                    meeting, working with others, of course. We also were involved in working out
                    the logistics of this large scale meeting. I think that it's one of the best
                    things that our bureau ever did. This was fairly early in my tenure as Assistant
                    Secretary, and I give full credit to my colleagues for their efforts.We had one,
                    specific diplomatic challenge, too. That was the representation of Taiwan at
                    this Summit Meeting. As long as it was not at the Summit Level, China had lived
                    with a Taiwanese economic minister coming to the APEC meetings, but did not want
                    to have the Taiwanese foreign minister attend, for symbolic reasons. Taiwan
                    always had a minister there, just as other countries did. But the other
                    countries also had foreign ministers attending in previous years.</p>
                <p>When you get to the Summit Level, what do you do? Taiwan, of course, wanted to
                    send President Lee Teng-hui, and the Chinese were sending Jiang Zemin. The
                    Chinese said that they would not agree to having Lee Teng-hui at the meeting. So
                    we had a hell of a challenge. Again, my deputy, Peter Tomsen, took this on,
                    including the preparatory meetings on APEC, which I also went to. Tomsen was the
                    point person for the preliminary arrangements, with the help of Sandy Kristoff.
                    After working with the Taiwanese and the Chinese we worked out a deal in Seattle
                    at the working level, which was then referred back to the respective capitals.
                    The Chinese agreed that Taiwan could attend, although they had not even wanted a
                    Taiwan representative there at the Summit Meeting. The Chinese agreed that the
                    Taiwanese could still participate in the meetings of the foreign or economic
                    ministers prior to the Summit Meeting itself. However, the Chinese didn't want
                    to sit in the same room with, or accept the presence of, someone else
                    representing Taiwan at the chiefs of state level. This would look like two
                    states or two governments representing China.</p>
                <pb facs="0840" n="Page0840"/>
                <p>It wasn't easy, but we got the Chinese to agree that Taiwan could attend. We got
                    Taiwan to agree in turn that the chief Taiwanese representative would not be Lee
                    Tung-Hui, the President of Taiwan. Instead, the chief Taiwanese representative
                    would be a kind of super economic minister. He was at a somewhat higher level
                    than the chief Taiwanese representative had previously been at APEC meetings,
                    but he was still not a head of state or head of government. His functions were
                    purely economic.</p>
                <p>We thought that this was a pretty ingenious deal, which has held up every year
                    since then at APEC Summit Meetings. Prior to these meetings Taiwan and China
                    would come to us. Taiwan would want to up the level. We would say: “Go to the
                    host country. It's their problem this year, not ours.” They have always stuck to
                    this level, and it's probably going to continue to stay at this level. However,
                    our arrangement was a matter of considerable significance. Taiwan is very
                    important, economically.</p>
                <p>I've already told the story perhaps, but I'll tell it again. On the way out to
                    Seattle, President Clinton was going over his speech. He came across a phrase
                    which he told the speechwriter he liked very much. The text said that Asian
                    countries had gone from being dominos to being dynamos. In a very generous and
                    unusual gesture for a speechwriter, he said that this was a phrase from Winston
                    Lord. The President's speech was carried on national television two days later
                    and was interrupted by applause. The President said that Winston Lord came up
                    with that phrase. He said that Lord had a lot of good ideas but he came up with
                    that phrase. I've always been grateful to the speechwriter.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Secretary of State Christopher gave a major speech on Asian policy. The
                    President gave another speech. We got a lot of visibility out of this in the
                    press and around Asia. We had a very fortunate chain of events in this
                    connection, which made this even more successful. Just before President Clinton
                    arrived in Seattle, he got a favorable vote out of the Senate approving the
                    NAFTA Treaty, using the APEC meeting as leverage to a certain extent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [NAFTA is the North American Free Trade Association.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: He got that with Republican Party votes, certainly. It was a good example
                    of how President Clinton, when he really throws himself into something, can get
                    something done. Unfortunately, he doesn't often do that on foreign policy, but
                    he did in this case. He won a very tough vote on the approval of NAFTA. If he
                    had lost that vote, it would have been another day or two before he arrived in
                    Seattle. He would have come into the APEC meeting severely weakened politically.
                    He would have gone to a major conference on trade and investment after having
                    lost to his own Senate. Conversely, having won that vote, President Clinton came
                    in with considerable momentum, having won a major victory on an issue that had
                    looked very tough.</p>
                <pb facs="0841" n="Page0841"/>
                <p>Together with the Asian leaders, he worked out a statement which at the first
                    year of meetings at the Summit Level, was essentially a vision for the future.
                    It wasn't concrete yet, but it was a commitment by all of the leaders attending
                    the APEC meeting to promote freer trade and investment in the region. It
                    stressed the importance of working together. It contained a lot of visionary
                    language. This was very much needed. The very fact that it took place at the
                    Summit Level was a real achievement during the first year of such meetings. No
                    specific agreements were needed. This gave a whole new lift to APEC, which had
                    been meandering along, in the shadows, without making much progress. Now it was
                    a useful meeting each year.</p>
                <p>So that APEC meeting really was a huge success. In subsequent years APEC made
                    further progress. The most dramatic step came the next year when APEC took that
                    vision, and the leaders agreed, that there would be free trade and investment
                    throughout the Asia-Pacific area by the year 2020. For the developed countries
                    like the U.S., Japan, and a couple of others, this goal was to be reached by the
                    year 2010. Now, a few years later, this may look relatively cautious, since
                    these are objectives to be achieved in 20-25 years. However, at the time, we
                    were talking about the elimination, in principle, of all tariffs and investment
                    barriers throughout this huge, vast region, which is the fastest growing area in
                    the world. It offers the greatest terrain for U.S. exports.</p>
                <p>This was a pretty bold objective. From the standpoint of the United States, it is
                    particularly good, because most of our tariffs and investment restrictions are
                    fairly low, anyway, and we have relatively free trade. Whereas in countries like
                    China and Japan, as well as in Southeast Asia, this objective has major
                    implications. Even though this deadline was some time off in the future, the
                    value of a deadline like that is that investors, governments, and entrepreneurs
                    start making decisions about trade and investment, knowing that this element of
                    much freer trade and investment is coming up. So this was a major political, as
                    well as economic, statement made in 1994 in Bogor, Indonesia.</p>
                <p>In the following year, 1995, the APEC meeting was held in Osaka, Japan. The
                    meetings are always held in November of each year. There are always lots of
                    lesser meetings throughout the year in preparation for this meeting. Foreign and
                    trade ministers meet just before the Summit Meeting itself, doing business of a
                    more nitty, gritty nature than the leaders. The summit leaders would lay out a
                    vision for the next year and would be working at it for the next 12 months. Then
                    the foreign and trade ministers would reach agreement in November and report to
                    their leaders.</p>
                <p>Right after that, the Summit Meeting itself would be held, issuinnew directives
                    for the next year. It was sort of a rolling process.</p>
                <pb facs="0842" n="Page0842"/>
                <p>President Clinton was due to go to Osaka, Japan, where the APEC Summit Meeting
                    was held in 1995. He was also supposed to make a state visit to Japan, in
                    addition to attending the APEC meeting. Well, there was a budget battle between
                    the White House and Congress in the fall of 1995, as you may recall. There were
                    rumors, hints, and speculation about a week or two before he was to leave on
                    this trip to Osaka that, since the U.S. Government might be shut down because
                    the budget had not been passed by Congress, this was so important an issue that
                    the President might have to cancel his trip to attend the APEC Summit Meeting
                    and make the state visit to Japan.</p>
                <p>I felt that the cancellation of this trip to attend the APEC Summit Meeting
                    couldn't be allowed to happen and, in fact, was unthinkable in the sense that it
                    would be a political blow to our Asian policy. Frankly, I didn't have any
                    illusions about my leverage, but I hoped to put more pressure on the White House
                    to stand by its commitment that the President would make the trip. I didn't
                    think that the cancellation of the trip would be justified. The President could
                    go for a day or two to Japan and then come back, if necessary.</p>
                <p>Before the APEC and other major, international meetings to which the President or
                    the Secretary of State traveled, I always went down to the Press Office in the
                    State Department and gave a briefing to the press, American and foreign. At
                    times I'd also talk to the foreign press on Worldnet and other international
                    television programs and would go to the White House and brief the press over
                    there. In my briefing leading up to the trip to Japan and APEC, I boldly said,
                    in response to a question, “There is no question that the President is going to
                    make this trip. He is sure to go. Indeed, it would be a serious blow to our
                    policy if he did not go.” I surely was stretching the envelope at this point, in
                    terms of my level. Lo and behold, the President did cancel the trip!</p>
                <p>A little, historical footnote. The day he canceled this trip was the first day
                    that he fooled around with Monica Lewinsky. He later said publicly that he had
                    made improper advances to her. I'm not saying that that's why he canceled the
                    trip. However, it made me particularly mad at the President, in addition to his
                    recklessness on other accounts. The day he canceled that trip was literally when
                    he had his first encounter with Monica Lewinsky. The budget shutdown was the
                    official reason given for the cancellation of the trip.</p>
                <p>Of course, the cancellation of the trip hurt our credibility with Asian leaders.
                    After all, it was President Clinton himself, who raised the level of the
                    meetings and had publicly made a commitment to the Asia-Pacific area at the
                    Summit Meeting in 1994. This trip cancellation also hurt us badly in Japan,
                    which had gone to great trouble to prepare for Clinton's state visit there.
                    President Clinton sent Vice President Gore in his stead. Gore did as good a job
                    as he possibly could, but he is not the President, after all. The natural
                    outcome of the Summit Meeting in Osaka in 1995 was less dramatic. You couldn't
                    have as dramatic an announcement at Osaka as we had had at Bogor, Indonesia, in
                    1994.</p>
                <pb facs="0843" n="Page0843"/>
                <p>There was some significance at the Osaka APEC meeting in 1995 in terms of each
                    nation preparing and submitting for review what they called “Initial Action
                    Plans.” That is, how they were going to move, incrementally, over the coming
                    years toward the targets to be met in 2010 or 2020, in terms of tariffs and
                    non-tariff barriers. So we did make some further progress. However, this was
                    pretty well overshadowed by the cancellation of President Clinton's planned trip
                    to APEC and Japan.</p>
                <p>This was a significant blow to us, at least temporarily. I wrote very frank
                    memoranda, talking about the fallout. I didn't pull any punches. I was really
                    very annoyed. I didn't believe the budget issue justified total cancellation.
                    However, it so happened that the postponement of the trip gave us a few more
                    months to work on the President's rescheduled trip to Japan, which took place
                    the following spring, in April, 1996. We had prepared pretty well for the Summit
                    Meeting in Osaka, and it would have been a success. However, it turned out that
                    the intervening months made this Japan Summit Meeting even more successful. The
                    postponement of the Summit Meeting gave us more time to strengthen our defense
                    relationship and the security declaration that we were going to announce.</p>
                <p>In the interim we had the Taiwan missile crisis, which made Japan willing to be
                    even stronger on defense matters, although it would already have been a strong
                    statement. As I mentioned in my discussion on Japan, we were able to work
                    further on the Okinawa problem, which was set off by the terrible rape by
                    Marines of a young Okinawan girl. So we set in motion a process to adjust the
                    presence of our forces in Okinawa and Japan and to consolidate them.</p>
                <p>When it eventually took place, President Clinton's trip to Japan in April, 1996,
                    turned out to be a smashing success. It was even better than it would have been,
                    had he gone to Osaka in November, 1995, although the interim period was rather
                    awkward and painful.</p>
                <p>Finally, the last APEC meeting when I was in office was held in Manila in
                    November, 1996. In some respects it was less sexy and visionary than previous
                    such meetings, as it would inevitably have to have been. The various Initial
                    Action Plans were revised, and some were more forthcoming than others. Our own
                    Initial Action Plan was somewhat hampered by the fact that the U.S. did not have
                    fast track negotiating authority, although our barriers to trade were already
                    pretty low. There was an agreement to work on specific sectors and to free up
                    trade and investment in these areas well before the deadlines of 2010 and 2020.
                    One particular area concerned information and telecommunications. There was a
                    major agreement to pursue free trade in this area. This was a huge sector in
                    international trade, and particularly for American exports. So that was not
                    insignificant.</p>
                <pb facs="0844" n="Page0844"/>
                <p>I would like to mention a couple of other, incidental points on APEC. First, we
                    had a heavy involvement with the private sector. That is, the business people.
                    We would consult with them extensively in advance. As I did continually
                    throughout my tenure as Assistant Secretary, we would try to find out what were
                    the practical barriers which individual businessmen and business groups faced in
                    the fields of trade and investment. In this connection I would meet individual
                    businesspeople as well as business groups. I would ask: “What could we do that
                    you would find helpful?” So we would feed in their ideas.</p>
                <p>We would also have meetings with American business people from around the East
                    Asian area, as part of the APEC Summit Meeting activity. So there would be
                    private sector meetings, as well as state sector meetings. There would be
                    private advisers consulting with U.S. Government officials, and so forth. We
                    tried to have a real partnership between the two groups.</p>
                <p>Also, as I mentioned, the Seattle meeting of APEC came after the NAFTA [North
                    American Free Trade Association] victory. Then, when the bolder vision for freer
                    trade and investment was declared at Seattle in 1993, this got the Europeans
                    nervous, because they saw that the U.S., Canada, and Asia were moving ahead, not
                    as a single, great bloc, but certainly with a lot of trade interaction. So the
                    Europeans were getting a little concerned. They made some concessions in the
                    Uruguay Round of tariff negotiations under the GATT [General Agreement on
                    Tariffs and Trade], which helped that effort to conclude a couple of months
                    later.</p>
                <p>So, within about four or five months we had what we called a triple play. We had
                    a NAFTA victory, an APEC Summit Meeting and the “Bolder Vision” of APEC for the
                    future, and then there was the GATT Uruguay Round agreement. So it was a rather
                    major period in international economic history. Probably it was the most
                    significant trade liberalization achievement in any concentrated six-month
                    period in the history of the world. So President Clinton deserves high marks,
                    particularly in the early going, for his international trade strategy. APEC was
                    a central feature of it.</p>
                <p>Finally, APEC, even when I was in office and certainly now, faces choices about
                    its future direction. In other words, how do you maintain momentum when you're
                    slogging out action plans to move toward a deadline? Each year you try to get a
                    little bit more liberalization. How can you keep this process going? Can you do
                    this by trying to free up whole economic sectors and move ahead? What do the
                    foreign ministers talk about, because the trade ministers have taken over the
                    basic ministerial level meetings, where they worked on nitty, gritty trade
                    issues? Above all, what do the national heads of government talk about? To what
                    extent do you talk about issues other than trade and investment?</p>
                <pb facs="0845" n="Page0845"/>
                <p>An easy answer is to talk about issues that are closely related to economic
                    matters, like the environment, which they are beginning to do. The tough answer
                    is whether to talk about political or security issues. My answer to this is that
                    it's hard to draw the line all the time. Already the leaders were talking about
                    political issues, to a certain extent, but not security matters, which should be
                    reserved for the regional security dialogues. The lines between the two are
                    often blurred. Moreover, you have to make these meetings interesting for the
                    heads of government, or they won't attend.</p>
                <p>Now, if you have a financial crisis in Asia, as we have seen since I left office,
                    there is plenty to talk about. One of the challenges now is whether APEC will be
                    more active than it has been so far in meeting that crisis.</p>
                <p>One last note on APEC. It is also useful as a focus for all kinds of bilateral
                    meetings. It is like the UN General Assembly, which is an umbrella and excuse
                    for people to converge in one place and have a series of bilateral, trilateral,
                    and other lateral kinds of meetings. At an APEC meeting, President Clinton would
                    always have five or six formal bilateral meetings. On other occasions he would
                    sit next to leaders of others countries at dinners or receptions or simply when
                    he was walking around. So this was a terrific time for him to meet with a whole
                    bunch of Asia-Pacific leaders. It was also a very economic use of his time. We
                    use the APEC meeting not only for the President's meetings but also at the
                    foreign minister level. The same thing would be done with trade ministers.</p>
                <p>So over the course of several days at an APEC meeting, there would be all kinds
                    of bilateral and trilateral meetings at all different levels, which was very
                    helpful. We had a Korea-Japan-U.S. meeting on the Korean crisis, for example.
                    This was a time each year when our President would meet with the President of
                    China, who at the time was Jiang Zemin, before we had summit meetings in each
                    other's country. Even though politically we hadn't prepared the way for mutual
                    visits, such as we have had during the last couple of years, there was a chance
                    for the two leaders to meet bilaterally in the context of the APEC meeting. It
                    made it very easy to arrange.</p>
                <p>So, for all of these reasons, APEC turned out to be a very valuablasset. The
                    question is whether APEC can maintain its momentum.</p>
                <p>Q: I notice that when you were saying “Asia-Pacific,” you were also saying, “the
                    United States and Canada” on some other issue. There were two other countries
                    that I was thinking of: Mexico and Chile.</p>
                <pb facs="0846" n="Page0846"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes. I'm glad that you mentioned that. Membership is an issue that came up.
                    There is a classic question, first of all, as to whether you deepen a fairly
                    new, international organization, or whether you widen it. The EEC [European
                    Economic Commission] faced that issue in Europe. Nor was there a clear,
                    overriding theat, like the Soviet Union during the Cold War. So there was always
                    a debate about that.</p>
                <p>In APEC we were talking about important countries of the Pacific area. In the
                    Western Hemisphere there are countries like Chile, Mexico, and Peru. The primary
                    considerations are that they are important in terms of trade, they border on the
                    Pacific Ocean, and they are generally free traders. Then, of course, there are
                    other claimants for membership in APEC. Russia considers itself a Pacific power.
                    Shouldn't they be included in APEC? Vietnam was a growing power. Shouldn't they
                    be in APEC? So there were a lot of debates and controversy, particularly at the
                    foreign minister level. It occupied us during the first couple of years.</p>
                <p>Secretary of State Christopher got around this issue by declaring a moratorium
                    after letting in Mexico and Chile. We then had a three-year moratorium, and this
                    issue of expansion began to come up again after I left the Government. Since
                    then Russia and Vietnam have expressed interest in joining APEC. (End of
                    tape)</p>
                <p>Q: Could we continue for a little more and talk about Asian values, whatever that
                    means, and the issue of regional defense? Then could you talk about Secretary of
                    State Warren Christopher and President Clinton and your views about them? Then
                    about the budget squeeze?</p>
                <p>LORD: Let me discuss those questions, minus Secretary Christopher and President
                    Clinton. We can see whether we have the time and energy to discuss them or
                    whether I ought to think more systematically about them. We could start with
                    them the next time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure, no problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: And we could look at the other substantive issues. What woulthat cover?</p>
                <p>Q: Well, here you were, the head of the Bureau of East Asian Affairs, dealing
                    with the appointment of Ambassadors and so forth. I'd also like to ask for your
                    views about the American Institute on Taiwan (AIT), political Ambassadors, and
                    general matters of that kind.</p>
                <p>LORD: We can get back to those and deal with the other issues here.</p>
                <pb facs="0847" n="Page0847"/>
                <p>Regarding the issue of regional security, I talked about that in my confirmation
                    statement before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in terms of the
                    building of the Pacific Community. As another aspect of our East Asian policy,
                    we wanted to blend both the bilateral and the regional aspects of it,
                    particularly as the Pacific area really wasn't a community at that time. You
                    don't throw away your important bilateral relationships. You maintain and
                    strengthen them and you also try to build some of these regional approaches.
                    I've mentioned various examples of that.</p>
                <p>This is where we departed somewhat from the policy of previous administrations.
                    On the whole, Asian policy has been fairly consistent from one administration to
                    another, though with some different nuances and emphases. For example, we raised
                    the APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Conference] meetings to a summit level, and we
                    were more aggressive on normalization with Vietnam.</p>
                <p>On regional security we took a different tack. Frankly, I did this without any
                    particular authorization because I was still in the process of being confirmed.
                    I more or less previewed this different tack in my confirmation statement. The
                    Bush Administration approach, which I think was quite understandable was that if
                    you encourage regional security organizations and dialogues, you run some
                    serious risks. Encouraging new regional security organizations might be
                    interpreted by our Asian friends as an effort by us of seeking a way out of our
                    responsibilities, of trying to turn over the burdens of American defense
                    responsibilities in the East Asian region, in both psychological and financial
                    terms, to regional organizations in an effort to try slowly to withdraw from the
                    region. So we might be sending the wrong signals if we indicated that we thought
                    that new regional security arrangements could replace our long standing
                    bilateral alliances. Secretary Baker had specifically laid out a concept that
                    our Asia policy should be composed of spokes in a wheel, with the U.S. in the
                    middle of this wheel, and with various, bilateral spokes going out from it.</p>
                <p>Also, the previous, [Bush] administration had plausibly pointed out that Asia is
                    not Europe. Asia is much more culturally diverse and more geographically spread
                    out. There is no real, collective security approach, unlike NATO [North Atlantic
                    Treaty Organization] in Europe. So any possible parallel approaches would not
                    really hold up. Also, as I have pointed out, regional security schemes, which
                    had popped up over the course of many years, often had a subversive quality. The
                    Russians, and Brezhnev in particular, often used to propose collective security
                    in Asia, precisely to try to reduce American influence. This Russian idea
                    appeared to involve turning to peacekeeping and a collective mini-UN type of
                    approach, in order to drive out the U.S.</p>
                <p>So for all of these reasons there was little enthusiasm in thprevious
                    administration for regional security arrangements.</p>
                <pb facs="0848" n="Page0848"/>
                <p>I took a different view. I don't think that there was unanimous agreement in the
                    new administration but I encouraged this for those who hadn't thought about it.
                    I set this idea forth in my confirmation statement before the Senate Foreign
                    Relations Committee.</p>
                <p>I said that, first of all, we reaffirmed our bilateral alliances. They came
                    first. We should not lightly dismiss them or in any way call them into question.
                    In fact, we should try to strengthen them. They were still relevant and still
                    important in the world following the end of the Cold War. That should be our
                    foundation.</p>
                <p>Secondly, another foundation should be our forward military presence. We had
                    reached the level of roughly 100,000 troops deployed in East Asia, having
                    reduced this level down from about 130,000 during the latter phase of the Cold
                    War. We should make clear that we were going to maintain a level of about
                    100,000 troops deployed in East Asia, assuming that the host countries, and
                    particularly Japan and South Korea, the major powers concerned, wanted to
                    continue to have us do that. I said that these countries wanted us to maintain
                    this level of troop deployments as a stabilizing presence. So in no way would we
                    question these foundations which were in place and which the previous
                    administration had also been in favor of.</p>
                <p>However, to supplement and not to supplant these foundations, we could begin to
                    look to the conduct of a regional security dialogue. Not as a replacement, as I
                    said, but as an additional factor to deal with this vast region of East Asia. I
                    said that we should do this gradually. This should not be seen as an attempt to
                    shed our responsibilities. Rather, we should seek to reduce tensions and promote
                    a better climate in the area, even as we maintained our hard headed alliances
                    and a forward, military presence.</p>
                <p>Conceivably, over a long period of time, maybe the climate would change and these
                    regional organizations would be strong enough that we could begin to reduce our
                    presence in the area. However, we didn't assume that this would happen, and this
                    wasn't our purpose. This was to be added insurance for security purposes and
                    stability.</p>
                <p>We felt that we should encourage regional dialogue, though not so much on the
                    level of NATO. NATO was one bloc set against another bloc in Europe and a
                    defined threat in the form of the Soviet Union. Rather, we should seek to
                    develop a gradually increasing dialogue with the countries of East Asia to have
                    a better understanding of each other's intentions, reduce miscalculations, build
                    up a somewhat greater climate of trust, and talk about sensitive issues. We
                    would seek to develop confidence-building measures and perhaps to move on to
                    preventive diplomacy, where you seek to head off conflicts, and even get to the
                    point of conflict resolution, where you try to resolve conflicts.</p>
                <pb facs="0849" n="Page0849"/>
                <p>When we came into office, an annual practice had developed under my predecessors.
                    Every year, in the spring, usually in May, there was a meeting with the ASEAN
                    [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] countries at the Assistant Secretary
                    level to prepare the agenda of security issues for a subsequent meeting in July,
                    when the Foreign Ministers would meet. This Foreign Ministers meeting was called
                    the ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference. The Ministerial Conference was a summit
                    meeting of ASEAN leaders and their Foreign Ministers. After that, the ASEAN
                    countries would have a dialogue with key outside powers in two forms. First,
                    there would be a series of bilateral dialogues. The ASEAN leaders would sit with
                    their interlocutors from the United States, the EEC [European Economic
                    Community] countries, Japan, China, Australia, and New Zealand. By that time,
                    the Republic of Korea was also included. Second, the ministers of all of these
                    countries would meet at one time in one place and talk about regional
                    issues.</p>
                <p>There was no attempt to do any work between these sessions, such as holding
                    committee meetings. There wasn't much discussion of sensitive issues. The
                    participants made mostly set statements. These really didn't go very far.</p>
                <p>So the first thing I did was to make sure that Secretary of State Christopher
                    would be willing to attend this ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference. Generally,
                    the Secretary of State attended these meetings, but on a couple of occasions he
                    missed attending these sessions. That sent a very bad signal. I wanted to make
                    sure that as part of our effort to make some fast progress with our Asian
                    associates, our Secretary of State would attend these post-ministerial
                    meetings.</p>
                <p>Again, just as was the case with APEC, this was very useful, not only for the
                    dialogue with the Asian countries but also for the various bilateral meetings
                    that we would have. So it was possible to have bilateral meetings with other
                    countries which were there to have a dialogue with ASEAN countries, as well as
                    the dialogues we had there in the collective meeting.</p>
                <p>In 1994 we agreed to invite other key countries which had not been attending this
                    post ministerial conference. We wanted them to join that, and we arranged to
                    call this meeting the ASEAN Regional Forum, or the ARF. I was always glad that
                    we didn't call it the “Biannual ASEAN Regional Forum,” which might have been
                    contracted to “BARF!” So we included China, Vietnam, Russia, Laos, and Papua New
                    Guinea, which had not previously attended this meeting. We agreed that every
                    year, at the Foreign Ministers' level, these countries would meet with the rest
                    of us collectively, in addition to the ongoing bilateral meetings with
                    ASEAN.</p>
                <p>We also maintained the somewhat separate grouping; the ASEAN post ministerial
                    conference had become a little cumbersome. We really talked generally about
                    relations between the countries concerned. The discussions were not limited to
                    security matters. The new ASEAN Regional Forum as such was just concerned with
                    security issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0850" n="Page0850"/>
                <p>Starting in July, 1994, we would start first with the ASEAN Regional Forum [ARF].
                    It started out as a half day's meeting and then extended into a full day. The
                    emphasis was on very informal meetings with only the Foreign Ministers and one
                    aide present from each country participating. In that case I was the aide
                    present with Secretary of State Christopher. Since then they have managed to
                    expand participation to one more person, so that they could get someone from the
                    Pentagon attending. There would be a note taker in another room, listening in on
                    a public address system, so thank God I didn't have to take notes! There was
                    just the Secretary of State, me, and another official. After that we would have
                    the post ministerial conference, on issues beyond security.</p>
                <p>We made modest progress throughout this period. Several interesting things
                    happened. At first the Chinese were quite cautious. They were happy to join
                    these consultations but they didn't want to discuss sensitive issues there. They
                    wanted to keep it a general discussion, partly because they wanted to deal on
                    sensitive issues with countries on an individual basis, particularly with regard
                    to the South China Sea, which was of interest to many ASEAN countries. The
                    Chinese figured that they could throw their weight around by dealing with this
                    issue bilaterally. They were worried that if the various issues involved in the
                    South China Sea became involved in an ASEAN forum, they would have to take on
                    ASEAN collectively. There were other issues which they didn't want to discuss,
                    such as Taiwan and so forth.</p>
                <p>So in the early going we tried to make progress in the sense of discussing
                    sensitive issues at these meetings. In addition, we sought to have meetings
                    throughout the year in between these Foreign Ministers' meetings. We talked
                    about confidence building measures that could be explored at these sessions.
                    However, the Chinese wanted to go slowly. Some of the other countries such as
                    Malaysia, I believe, also wanted to go slowly. Some other countries, such as
                    Australia, Singapore, and the United States, wanted to move more quickly. Japan
                    and Korea were somewhere in between.</p>
                <p>As time went on the Chinese became a little more relaxed about becoming engaged,
                    and more sensitive issues, including the South China Sea, came up. We even
                    discussed Burma, which, after all, is a Southeast Asian country. We discussed
                    Burma while the Chinese were sitting there, and they even joined in the
                    discussion. So the dialogue became a little freer and a little more spontaneous,
                    with a little less speech-making. I don't want to exaggerate the speed of the
                    process. It still had some distance to go at this point.</p>
                <p>We also got the Foreign Ministers to agree on confidence building measures, and
                    the U.S. did much of the heavy lifting in this respect. Countries agreed to
                    issue white papers on their defense policies. During this period China issued
                    its first two white papers on this subject. There was cooperation on search and
                    rescue issues and on dealing with some natural disasters. There was some
                    discussion of having observers present at military exercises and arranging for
                    exchanges of military officials.</p>
                <pb facs="0851" n="Page0851"/>
                <p>So the first step in the ASEAN Regional Forum agendas was to include these
                    confidence building measures, involving greater transparency and cooperation. We
                    hoped to move over time into more diplomatic areas, such as perhaps preventing
                    crises or at least heading off miscalculations, and maybe some day getting into
                    conflict resolution, although we were a long way from that.</p>
                <p>One specific contribution the ASEAN Regional Forum made involved Mischief Reef, a
                    disputed island which China occupied in the Spratley Islands, which the
                    Philippines claimed as its territory. It was close to the Philippines. There was
                    a lot of tension about this island where the Chinese were establishing a
                    presence. We issued a very strong statement. It was not anti-Chinese, but it was
                    clearly meant to warn China against the use of force. We said that we took no
                    stand on the territorial issues involved here, but said that there shouldn't be
                    any unilateral actions. The international law of the sea and freedom of
                    navigation should be observed, and we hoped that the countries involved would
                    work out this matter peacefully. This was a much stronger statement than had
                    ever been made previously. There also was a rather strong ASEAN statement which
                    supported the Philippines.</p>
                <p>I believe that the advent in 1994 of the ASEAN Regional Forum added to the
                    pressure on the Chinese to back off, to talk to ASEAN collectively, and to
                    behave themselves on this issue. So the advent of the ASEAN Regional Forum
                    meeting, together with these other actions, persuaded the Chinese to back down.
                    It helped to defuse that crisis. This showed the potential of the ASEAN Regional
                    Forum.</p>
                <p>We added a couple of more members, Cambodia and Mongolia, in the ASEAN Regional
                    Forum which, we felt, were important. Meanwhile, we had to differentiate this
                    meeting from the ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference. We were trying to push the
                    latter conference into more global issues, like nuclear non-proliferation and
                    terrorism, and even some issues which overlapped with APEC, such as the
                    environment.</p>
                <p>I don't want to exaggerate the significance of the ASEAN Regional Forum, but we
                    thought that we had started something which could be quite useful. Under the
                    umbrella of these meetings we held bilateral discussions with the Chinese,
                    because Secretary of State Christopher would always meet with the Chinese
                    Foreign Minister on such occasions. As I said, even though Christopher only made
                    two trips to China, he met with the Chinese often, in various cities. He also
                    attended high-level, trilateral meetings on Korea (U.S., Japan, South Korea)
                    which took place around the edges of ARF. So this was another part of our effort
                    to build a Pacific Community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I gather that with these institutions you have to draw the
                        linsomewhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0852" n="Page0852"/>
                <p>Q: However, as I look at the map and think of some of the issues involved, I
                    would think that there would be a temptation to bring India into the discussions
                    as an observer, or something like that. In a way, India has some interest in a
                    good number of these matters.</p>
                <p>LORD: I'm glad you made that point. I'm glad you mentioned this. In my last year
                    as Assistant Secretary for East Asian Affairs [1996] Indian participation became
                    a hot issue for exactly the reasons that you mentioned, in view of India's
                    geographical position, to some extent its naval capability, and the tensions in
                    its relationship with China.</p>
                <p>So as you can imagine there was a debate, and even within the U.S. Government, on
                    Indian participation. You can imagine the debate that took place between the
                    various bureaus of the State Department on this matter. The issue was a classic
                    one. There were all of the reasons mentioned for including India. However, the
                    problem was how to include India without including Pakistan. When you start
                    opening up the membership...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you have to include Sri Lanka and others.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: And you turn it into a sort of mini-UN. On balance, I favored including
                    India, drawing the line against including Pakistan, even though this might cause
                    some strain with Pakistan. I think that India has a clear, East Asian dimension,
                    just by virtue of geography and culture. It has a much greater interest and
                    presence in East Asia than Pakistan.</p>
                <p>I felt that the way to do this was to make clear that Sub-Continent, South Asian
                    issues like Kashmir and so forth, would not be discussed. We would only discuss
                    East Asian issues with India's participation. Obviously, there was no happy way
                    to resolve this, and Pakistan was not pleased. We worked hard on this matter. I
                    worked effectively with Singapore behind the scenes. Singapore has a heavy
                    Indian influence and so wanted to include India. One of the Singapore arguments,
                    which I agreed with, was rather subtle. Singapore argued that the inclusion of
                    India in the ASEAN Regional Forum would increase leverage on the Chinese. Any
                    consideration of Chinese-Indian tensions would involve having one more entity to
                    work with in dealing with these tensions, not to mention the legitimate security
                    concerns of China, India, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely. When you look at this matter, it really
                        lookincomplete.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: You are very perceptive. I can't think of anything else.</p>
                <p>Q: While you were Assistant Secretary for East Asian Affairs, how did the Indians
                    respond to the matter of inclusion in the ASEAN Regional Forum? Did you find
                    that they were a positive influence?</p>
                <pb facs="0853" n="Page0853"/>
                <p>LORD: Yes. India was only included in the forum during the last year I was there
                    [1996]. They were quite responsible, and very grateful to the U.S., and me
                    personally, for getting them in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you have already referred to it but I wonder if
                        you coulexplain the issue of Asian values.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Yes. There is one other thing I would like to mention first. One of the
                    challenges facing the ASEAN Regional Forum was that it was pretty well driven by
                    the ASEAN countries themselves. They organized it and provided the host country
                    every year. However, there was a feeling that the ASEAN countries perhaps
                    dominated the organization too much. After all, by the time I left the Bureau of
                    East Asian Affairs, while the six ASEAN members were in the process of
                    increasing to 10, there were 19 members of ARF [ASEAN Regional Forum]. With the
                    increase of ASEAN members to 10 the ASEAN countries provided about half of the
                    membership of the ASEAN Regional Forum. So we often met with non-ASEAN members
                    of the ARF to try and get our strategies aligned. Not so much with China but
                    with some of the other countries. We thought that ASEAN had a right to provide a
                    certain driving force in the ASEAN Regional Forum, but we also didn't want the
                    ASEAN countries to dominate everything.</p>
                <p>Also, to the extent that the ASEAN Regional Forum was driven by the ASEAN
                    countries, it didn't seem particularly well suited to discuss Northeast Asian
                    situations. We would talk about Korean issues and, to a certain extent,
                    China-Taiwan, and U.S.-Japan defense relations in the ARF as part of our effort
                    to discuss sensitive issues. However, part of the problem with the size and
                    diversity of the ARF, which I supported, was that you couldn't really discuss
                    some of these key issues in any meaningful way.</p>
                <p>We had always envisaged our approach to regional security as not only involving
                    alliances and foreign military presences plus the ASEAN regional dialogue. We
                    also thought of other groupings which would address specific issues. On Korea,
                    for example, we ended up with Four Power Talks (the two Koreas, China, and the
                    U.S.). We also started an informal, non-governmental six power dialogue on
                    security. We called it the Northeast Asian Security Dialogue. This was organized
                    by a professor from the University of San Diego named Susan Shirk, who is now
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for China in the Bureau of East Asian
                    Affairs. With her help and leadership we created a grouping of six countries,
                    including the U.S., Japan, South Korea, North Korea, China, and Russia.</p>
                <pb facs="0854" n="Page0854"/>
                <p>There was one exploratory meeting held during my first year in the Bureau, which
                    was at the technical level. This meeting was attended by academic figures and
                    governmental officials from Defense and Foreign Ministries, in their unofficial
                    capacities. There were North Koreans attending that first meeting. We generally
                    had yearly meetings afterwards at the deputy level (Peter Tomsen went for the
                    U.S.), but we never got the North Koreans to join in this unofficial
                    organization. Partly for that reason, we never tried to make this an official
                    organization, but this remained our longer term goal. We felt that it was
                    important to have a smaller grouping concerned with Northeast Asia, which would
                    be more manageable than the ASEAN Regional Forum. Also, this sent a certain
                    signal to the ASEAN Regional Forum that we had other options if the ASEAN
                    countries tried to dominate the proceedings in the ARF.</p>
                <p>We felt that at unofficial meetings people would speak more freely than they
                    could if they attended as government officials. This was something like sending
                    scouts out on the terrain, trying to see what the situation was. They would
                    report back to their governments, even though the meetings were unofficial. We
                    were working with some academics and scholars, trying to see whether some
                    progress could be made. That was another area where we tried to make progress,
                    although we never got very far.</p>
                <p>A couple of points on “global issues” before I get to the issue of Asian values.
                    In my March, 1993 confirmation hearings, I included matters related to the
                    environment and other “global issues.” President Clinton and Secretary of State
                    Christopher put emphasis on these global issues. We can no longer call them new,
                    but they were still fresh issues in addition to the traditional security and
                    economic matters. Other such issues besides the environment were refugees,
                    terrorism, drugs, and international crime. Some people would put down nuclear
                    proliferation under this heading. So I included that as one of the ten
                    challenges I mentioned in my confirmation statement. It seemed to me that, by
                    definition, since most of these were global issues, they would have to be
                    treated globally and not regionally. However, just as we can have regional
                    trading groups that led to global approaches, I thought, we can do some work
                    here in the East Asian region on these matters.</p>
                <p>I'm not going to pretend that this was our highest priority, but we made some
                    efforts on these global issues, both bilaterally and regionally, as well as
                    globally.</p>
                <p>Bilaterally, with Japan, we established what we called a “Common Agenda.” I
                    mentioned that in the Japan section of this interview. This includes the
                    environment, natural disasters, AIDS, science and technology, etc. There is a
                    whole range of such issues on which we work collectively with Japan. It never
                    got much publicity, but we did a lot of useful work.</p>
                <p>With China we similarly tried to carve out positions on some of these issues,
                    which I mentioned in the China section of this interview. We sought to increase
                    cooperation with China on the environment on drugs, terrorism, and other issues.
                    We fleshed out our agenda bilaterally and also addressed these problems
                    globally.</p>
                <pb facs="0855" n="Page0855"/>
                <p>I went with Mrs. Clinton to the United Nations Conference on Women i1995.</p>
                <p>We would talk about the environment in places like APEC [Asia Pacific Economic
                    Conference] and the ASEAN Regional Forum. The environment was a major part of
                    our agenda in the South Pacific Forum, which I mentioned elsewhere in this
                    interview. The Clinton administration was pro environment and worked on global
                    climate issues or, for example, the coral reef initiative. Secretary of State
                    Christopher gave increased emphasis to the environment within the State
                    Department by appointing an additional Under Secretary for Global Affairs, Tim
                    Wirth, a former U.S. Senator who coordinated the work of various bureaus within
                    this area like the environment, narcotics, crime, human rights, refugees, and so
                    on.</p>
                <p>Under this heading the drug issue was important, and there were certain, key
                    countries, such as Burma, which I have already mentioned. With Thailand we had
                    increasing cooperation, and the same thing was true with Laos. There were some
                    discussions with Vietnam. We had some cooperation with Cambodia, where there was
                    a growing problem of drug addiction. We had considerable cooperation with China,
                    where there was more and more concern about the drug problem.</p>
                <p>Thus, we did pay some attention to global issues. I can't say that we ever really
                    achieved a great deal, although we certainly made some progress, in terms of
                    some of our bilateral relationships, and to a certain extent with APEC and
                    elsewhere where we had more systematic discussions of the issues.</p>
                <p>Finally, let's move on to the whole question of democracy and human rights, and
                    the related so-called Asian values. I hate to keep referring to my confirmation
                    statement but I knew that matters of this kind were going to be a part of the
                    intellectual and political debate during my projected four years as Assistant
                    Secretary for East Asian Affairs, or however long my tenure in office was going
                    to be. So I paid considerable attention to issues of that kind. I made promoting
                    democracy and human rights the tenth of my goals, although this did not mean
                    that this issue was the tenth most important. Indeed, in a way, it summarized
                    the intellectual challenge. I couldn't put it first, but putting it in tenth
                    place gave it more visibility than making it fifth or sixth, and it cut across
                    all the other nine issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0856" n="Page0856"/>
                <p>Promoting human rights and democracy amounted to a mixed bag in Asia. There were
                    a lot of established democracies of different types in the region, or what we
                    would call democracies. Among these are Japan, which, of course, is essentially
                    a one-party democracy. In South Korea they have made considerable progress in
                    making more sense of their political system; South Korea had become a democracy,
                    with elections, by the time we entered office. Taiwan is making its democracy
                    take root, making clear that Chinese care about freedom. The Philippines and
                    Thailand are democracies. Mongolia is struggling to become a full-fledged
                    democracy. In Asia and around the world, people have struggled and even risked
                    their lives to vote, whether in Cambodia, where almost 90 percent of the people
                    voted, crossing minefields and facing massive intimidation, or in Mongolia,
                    traveling for miles and miles on horseback in order to vote. All of this, in my
                    mind, proves that democracy is one of the universal aspirations of mankind and
                    that it isn't just a Western concern. The people time and again showed that it
                    was important in their view.</p>
                <p>The field of human rights is not the same thing as democracy but closely related
                    to it. Human rights are most respected and protected in democratic systems. I
                    have discussed at length how we handled these issues with China. With Vietnam,
                    as in the case of China, we had a formal dialogue and raised some specific
                    issues as well as the general matter of human rights, including the release of
                    some prisoners. Burma's repression was a key problem. In Indonesia, there were
                    human rights problems, particularly in East Timor. These were some of the major
                    human rights problems. I have just placed each of them in their own context
                    elsewhere in my interview.</p>
                <p>In promoting human rights and democracy, I often took on the so-called “Asian
                    values” question, which I tried to include in some of my speeches. I said that
                    we would promote democratic values without arrogance, but also without apology.
                    By saying “without arrogance” I meant that we had to be careful not to be
                    self-righteous and not to display a kind of missionary zeal. That is, other
                    people didn't have to be like us, because they had national histories and
                    cultures that were different. We had to avoid making this the only issue in our
                    bilateral relations, when with these countries we had many security, economic,
                    political, and other interests to deal with. We had to avoid looking as if were
                    we being overbearing on this issue, hurting other interests by looking arrogant
                    or overly zealous. Sometimes we needed to avoid complicating our efforts by
                    being too public and expressing our views in a way which was too much in other
                    people's faces, as it were. This could make it mighty difficult for them to
                    move, even if they wanted to do so. So we tried to avoid arrogance.</p>
                <pb facs="0857" n="Page0857"/>
                <p>However, on the other hand, we also avoided making apologies, in the sense that
                    we made it clear that we stood for certain things in this country. Americans
                    have always had the view that their foreign policy has some idealistic, as well
                    as some practical realpolitik elements. To maintain support for our foreign
                    policies in Congress and among the American people, we had to express some of
                    these values in our relationships. So this was important in our foreign policy
                    generally, as long as we didn't promote them in an arrogant way. We would do
                    this without apology.</p>
                <p>Also, in terms of tone, we tried to promote our democracy and human rights in
                    terms of other nations' self-interests, as opposed to just appealing to human
                    goodness and universal aspirations. For example, in my speeches I continually
                    made the case that, in an age of globalization, of computers, fax machines,
                    cellular phones, satellites, and the Internet, a country cannot develop its
                    economy, certainly over a period of time, without opening up its society. You
                    need to have pluralism, openness, and freedom of information if you want to
                    compete in today's world. This is just a matter of objective reality and of
                    self-interest. Maybe, if a country has a small economy, like Singapore's, which
                    has the rule of law but still isn't a full democracy, you can get away with some
                    undemocratic behavior for a while. Maybe, as in the case of China, you can have
                    a mixed bag with economic reform and political repression and, for a while, make
                    progress. But this cannot last long.</p>
                <p>Over time, open societies are clearly necessary for development purposes. For
                    example, you cannot attract investment, which you need to develop, if there is
                    not transparency, the rule of law, the rule of contracts and honoring contracts,
                    which are elements of democracy. For example, you cannot attack corruption,
                    which is so much of a problem in so many countries, including those countries
                    which have an emerging free market system, unless you have a free press to
                    attack corruption and ventilate these problems. You cannot move forward on
                    difficult reforms where there is going to be disagreement about the proper role
                    of the state, without some free dissent and debate, with different viewpoints
                    freely expressed. You cannot have what can be painful transitions where you have
                    at least temporary unemployment or other problems of adjustment in a global
                    economy, without some political safety valves through which people can express
                    dissent peacefully. If they can't express such dissent peacefully, then the only
                    way that they can do so is to take to the streets. I think that that's going to
                    be a problem in China, which has huge problems of unemployment, exacerbated by
                    widespread corruption. If the Chinese Government doesn't give people the chance
                    to express themselves peacefully, there will be more ominous demonstrations of
                    discontent, especially when it gets into the WTO.</p>
                <pb facs="0858" n="Page0858"/>
                <p>We tried to lay out this self interest line and to say that it was in the
                    interest of the Asian countries to loosen up and be more pluralistic and more
                    open. We said that you don't have to attempt to implement Jeffersonian, American
                    democracy. We said that elections aren't the only yardstick of a free society,
                    although elections are important to hold governments accountable because if they
                    make mistakes, there can be peaceful change and some other government can enter
                    power, as happened in Korea and Thailand. In contrast, the previous government
                    of Indonesia was overthrown because Indonesia didn't have a democracy.</p>
                <p>So, as I say, we tried to stress the self-interest aspect as well aspecific
                    components like the rule of law, free press, etc.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, I believed strongly in another reason to promote freedom which we
                    stressed to American audiences. I often raised this with my old boss, Henry
                    Kissinger and others, who were less enthusiastic about how important democracy
                    should be. The fact is that democracy and open societies serve our hard-headed
                    national security interest. I read this in a book - I don't know how a person
                    can judge this, but it's stated in this book that there have been roughly 350
                    wars fought since 1819 and none of them has been between two established
                    democracies. Whether or not this is absolutely accurate, the fact is that people
                    cannot come up with examples where two democracies have fought each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can play a real game with the case of Germany versus
                        France i1914.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Well, I wouldn't call the Kaiser's Germany a real democracy. You can get
                    into some semantic battles, but the fact is that, depending on how you define
                    democracies, wars, and so on, it's very hard to find many, if any, examples of
                    two, open democracies fighting each other. Generally, democracies are not
                    aggressive, even against non-democracies, although they will defend their
                    interests.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, open, democratic societies don't persecute minorities and their
                    citizens. Therefore, they don't drive people into opposition of a militant kind,
                    because the people can express their views. Or, put another way, democracies
                    don't generate refugees. You lessen refugee flows with open, democratic
                    societies. Furthermore, democratic governments do not practice government or
                    state terrorism. They are apt to be better trading partners and they are apt to
                    be better in terms of the environment. The Chernobyl disaster occurred partly
                    because Russia did not have a free press reporting on its problems.</p>
                <p>So there are a lot of hard-headed, pragmatic reasons to promote humarights and
                    democracy.</p>
                <pb facs="0859" n="Page0859"/>
                <p>So we also wove that theme in. We said that we were not just dealing with some
                    idealistic mission. We know that we have other interests to balance off with
                    human rights and democracy. But in a pragmatic way and particularly in terms of
                    security and economic development, the spread of freedom is crucial. It is in
                    the self-interest of the country that we are talking to. These are universal
                    aspirations are not just “Western” ideals. We can cite examples of this around
                    the world the past decade which I have mentioned particularly since the fall of
                    the Berlin Wall, including many places in Asia.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, we tried to work in, without being overly defensive, the view that
                    the U.S. was not perfect either, and we've had some need to perfect or improve
                    our own society. An important theme is that democracy is not just a matter of
                    elections. You can have elections in a given country which might bring in a
                    government which might then crack down and practice human rights abuses, despite
                    the elections. So you need to build a civil society, the infrastructure of
                    democracy, not just hold elections.</p>
                <p>Personally, I would introduce these themes at meetings which we would have and I
                    would include them in speeches. We would also balance these themes with our
                    other interests.</p>
                <p>Generally, we tried to get as much multilateral support as we could on these
                    themes. With the exception of Australia, Canada, and New Zealand we wouldn't get
                    much help from other countries in promoting these values. Japan was nervous in
                    terms of its guilt over World War II and didn't want to lecture other people. It
                    also had commercial interests. ASEAN has a couple of democracies but generally
                    didn't believe in interference in the internal affairs of its members or other
                    countries. European countries were more interested in business contracts than in
                    promoting human rights. Thus, even though we tried, at various levels, to get
                    some help, usually it was the U.S. operating by itself in dealing with these
                    matters.</p>
                <p>That brings us to the Asian values question, which is closely related. In that
                    debate we would make all of the points that I have already made. That was part
                    of our position in this debate. We would also point out that there aren't any
                    Asian values per se, because there are so many spokesmen for Asia. You have
                    Anwar versus Mahathir [in Malaysia], Aung San Suu Kyi [in Burma], Kim Dae Jung
                    [in South Korea], or the Dalai Lama [for Tibet]. There are a lot of such people
                    speaking for Asia beside the autocrats who use the slogan of stability as an
                    excuse for maintaining authoritarian government.</p>
                <p>The Asian values question came into concrete focus during the first year of my
                    service as Assistant Secretary for East Asian Affairs. A conference was held in
                    Vienna to review the UN Human Rights Covenant. Some of the Asian countries were
                    promoting amendments to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to provide for
                    some escape clauses to take into account local considerations and move away from
                    universality. We beat that effort off. Secretary Christopher was very strong on
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0860" n="Page0860"/>
                <p>I always felt that this was a phony debate, as if Westerners didn't care about
                    discipline, community commitment, and family values, or Asians didn't care about
                    freedom.</p>
                <p>I often met with human rights groups in the State Department and with such
                    organizations when I went to other countries, such as Cambodia, Indonesia, and
                    so forth. I met with human rights groups in the U.S., I'd say every three or
                    four months, even as I met with business people and other interest groups to try
                    to help to form our policy. I heard their viewpoints and reported back to them
                    on progress that had been made in Asia.</p>
                <p>I think that the whole fervor in the Asian values debate has sort of calmed down
                    somewhat. I think that people are now so concerned with the financial crisis
                    that the Asian values debate is beginning to fade from sight. It will be
                    important to see whether Thailand and South Korea, which are democracies and
                    which are also trying to carry out IMF [International Monetary Fund] recommended
                    reforms, succeed.</p>
                <p>Asian values were a hot issue during much of my tenure as Assistant Secretary. In
                    the spring 1994 memo to the Secretary which I wrote, and which we discussed, I
                    pointed out we were having some difficulties with our policies in the region.
                    This was a relatively famous memo which, I think, was called by some the
                    “Malaise Memo.” I have joked that it really was called the “Malaysian Memo.” I
                    addressed this values question. What I stressed in my memo was that we should be
                    careful about our tone, but promoting our values should be a high priority. I
                    thought that we should try to stress some of the themes that I have suggested,
                    so that stylistically we would be more effective and sensitive in promoting our
                    values.</p>
                <p>In my final week as Assistant Secretary I gave a farewell for journalists at the
                    Foreign Press Center. My opening talking points highlighted the challenges and
                    accomplishment of the past four years.</p>
                <p>Q: We might close at this point. There is one specific question which I'd like to
                    ask. One of my recent interviews was with David Dean who, at one point, was
                    Director of the American Institute on Taiwan [AIT]. He said that it should be
                    understood that we would never have a political appointee as the Director of
                    that office. Politically, the AIT is very sensitive. However, during the Clinton
                    administration a political figure was appointed to it. I think that we talked
                    about this issue.</p>
                <p>LORD: Let me give you a run down on that. First, a comment about Ambassadors
                    generally. I think that, like most Foreign Service Officers, I'm a strong
                    believer in having a mix of career and political Ambassadors. All that I ask,
                    and all that most FSO's ask, is that, first, political appointees should be
                    qualified. Secondly, they should be a distinct minority of Ambassadors, so that
                    you don't remove the incentive for Foreign Service Officers to move up to the
                    top level of the service. Thirdly, they shouldn't get all the most important
                    posts.</p>
                <pb facs="0861" n="Page0861"/>
                <p>In my view every administration has been guilty of having too many political
                    appointees. I think that roughly 15% of the Ambassadors should be political
                    appointees. But early in administrations, the figure of political appointee
                    Ambassadors is often about 40%. Then the figure drops down to about 30% as the
                    term wears on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's in that range.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I think that there are too many political appointee Ambassadors. Having
                    said that, I think that there's room, and there should be space for new people
                    coming in who are particularly qualified to take on an assignment as an
                    Ambassador. Someone who is well qualified and also politically connected with
                    the White House can take on assignments where clout is important. You can always
                    have experts qualified in that country, including DCM [Deputy Chief of Mission],
                    supporting the political appointee. However, you have to reserve the great bulk
                    of Ambassadorships, including many of the most important positions, in terms of
                    quality as well as quantity, for the Foreign Service. Otherwise, you're going to
                    destroy morale and you may not have as good Ambassadors. I can look at this
                    question in a detached way because I've been a Foreign Service Officer. However,
                    I've also been a political appointee, including my assignment as Ambassador to
                    China. Clearly, in my case I was qualified to be Ambassador to China, not only
                    because I had spent much of my career working on Chinese affairs, but I had the
                    other qualifications.</p>
                <p>Some of our best Ambassadors have been political appointees. To take a couple of
                    examples, we had Ambassador Mondale in Japan and Ambassador Laney as Ambassador
                    to South Korea. They were both terrific and were well qualified. We should make
                    sure that political appointees are well qualified and that the Foreign Service
                    provides most of the Ambassadors. There should always be room for some political
                    appointees in Washington. The Secretary and some of the Undersecretaries and
                    Assistant Secretaries should be political to provide new blood and effect White
                    House perspectives. But they should be experienced and able. And most of their
                    high level positions should be career people, to provide continuity and maintain
                    high morale in the career service. I don't believe there should be more than
                    occasional political appointees below the Assistant Secretary level.</p>
                <p>I'm not sure that I would ever make a permanent exception for any post, one way
                    or the other. If there is ever a case where you should only have career
                    appointees, it probably would be the Director of the AIT [American Institute on
                    Taiwan], who is a de facto Ambassador. Actually, we're not talking about the
                    person who is in Taiwan. In this case what David Dean is referring to is not the
                    Director of the AIT, who continues to be a career appointee; other Directors
                    have been Lynn Pascoe and Daryl Johnson. He's talking about the man who was
                    sitting in Washington and had David Dean's job. AIT is a strange, unofficial
                    relationship. It is a mechanism to maintain the appearance of unofficiality
                    while having an intermediary here in Washington, but of an unofficial
                    nature.</p>
                <pb facs="0862" n="Page0862"/>
                <p>We're talking for purposes of this recorded interview about the AIT person
                    sitting here in Washington, not the person in Taiwan, who has continued to be a
                    career officer and, in my view, should be. I'm not saying that this overseas
                    position should always be unofficial. However, as long as it is unofficial, I
                    think that it should be held by a career officer, as much as possible.</p>
                <p>The same thing is true of Washington, where we traditionally had distinguished
                    people like David Dean, who had a China and/or Taiwan background, spoke Chinese,
                    and knew people on Taiwan. These people also usually know quite a bit about
                    China. Above all, they should know the delicacies and sensitivities of the
                    Chinese-American relationship, how to manage this unofficial Rube Goldberg
                    contraption with Taiwan and who are not subject to domestic political pressures
                    from the Taiwan lobby and so on. So I would agree with David Dean's basic
                    premise that the Director of AIT should be a career Foreign Service Officer.</p>
                <p>Now, this practice was broken in the Clinton administration. This proved that
                    David Dean was right and that I was right, although I was not strong enough in
                    defending this position. The time came for a replacement for David Dean who,
                    after all, had been in the position for several years. It was only fair to
                    replace him. David Dean said that he didn't mind being replaced, as long as his
                    replacement was a good man. But that wasn't the issue.</p>
                <p>We began to get strong pressure from the White House to replace David Dean. The
                    White House pushed hard for James Wood. Wood had previously served in the State
                    Department as a political appointee. There was some controversy about how well
                    he did in that capacity. He left the Department. Some people felt that he left
                    because he was “incompetent” and perhaps this is not totally unfounded- (end of
                    tape)</p>
                <p>Wood had no ostensible qualifications to work on Taiwan affairs. He had helped
                    President Clinton in the election campaign of 1992. I forget now, but I think
                    that he was close to some people in the White House and elsewhere. He didn't
                    have a particularly distinguished career, including this murky time when he was
                    previously in the State Department. He claimed to have worked, at least to some
                    extent, on the Taiwan Relations Act. However, it was clear to me and to my
                    colleagues in the Bureau of East Asian Affairs that he did not have strong
                    qualifications. Above all, there was the principle that David Dean mentioned,
                    namely, that Taiwan was too tricky, sensitive, and arcane a relationship to be
                    handled by an inexperienced political appointee and subject to political
                    pressures. Not to mention a need to sense nuances from the substantive point of
                    view in dealing with Taiwan and China.</p>
                <pb facs="0863" n="Page0863"/>
                <p>So frankly I kept getting pressure from Dick Moose, who was Undersecretary of
                    State for Management. Dick, in turn, was getting pressure from the White House
                    to appoint Wood as Director of the AIT for Taiwan. I frankly ignored this
                    pressure, I dragged my feet, I said that he wasn't qualified, I said that they
                    should try somebody else if we couldn't keep David Dean in this position. I said
                    that if this guy needed a job, they should get him a job somewhere else where he
                    may be qualified. I said that maybe he was a good guy. I wasn't saying that he
                    shouldn't get a job, but not THIS job. I kept dragging my feet. I got several
                    phone calls. I dragged this out for about a year.</p>
                <p>Finally, the pressure got very heavy, and I made a mistake. I said that I would
                    interview the guy and check him out. He came across not too badly in the
                    interview. The pressure was so intense that I said that I finally didn't agree
                    with this appointment but we would have to go along with it if it was this
                    important to the White House. This was a mistake that I made at this point,
                    frankly. Maybe I could have stopped this appointment if I had really broken a
                    lot of crockery and resisted strongly enough. That's not certain, however.</p>
                <p>However, the pressure from the Seventh Floor [of the State Department, where the
                    Secretary of State and other senior officers have their offices] and from the
                    White House was very heavy. I pointed out the problems, but finally decided that
                    I would go along with the following package. The Secretary of State would
                    appoint him, but first we would have a written agreement with Wood on what his
                    job was and how free he was to operate. We would make it clear to him that he
                    was under my guidance and that of the State Department in general. This was the
                    case, and it's always been understood by career officers. That is, if Wood was
                    going to be a political appointee, we would have a charter showing that
                    nevertheless he was under our control. Secondly, we would get very strong (in
                    effect Vice) fellow Directors at AIT. We had had some good people, but they
                    weren't heavyweights; sometimes they were appointed to AIT as a favor to them as
                    retiring FSOs. This made clear we were going to get two people who were
                    knowledgeable on China and Taiwan and strong people to help control Wood if he
                    was going to be a problem.</p>
                <p>If I had known that he was going to be a disaster, I would have resisted his
                    appointment even more. I finally decided that the package seemed okay. I thought
                    that we would have a charter on how he was going to operate and would also have
                    two strong Directors in AIT to control and guide him. Indeed I didn't really
                    think that we would need to really control him. I thought that he might be weak,
                    but not nefarious. So we got Chris Phillips, who had been an Ambassador in our
                    Mission to the UN and had been the head of the National Committee on U.S.-China
                    Relations. We also got Bill Brown, who was an expert on Asia, and had also been
                    Ambassador to Thailand. So these were two heavy hitters.</p>
                <p>Q: Hadn't Brown been Ambassador to Israel, too?</p>
                <pb facs="0864" n="Page0864"/>
                <p>LORD: Israel, too. So these were two substantial people. We made it clear to them
                    in advance that we wanted their help. So, as a package, with the charter with
                    Wood, and with our feeling that Wood was not very strong and these two
                    colleagues, we felt that we could manage it. Secretary of State Christopher was
                    under great pressure himself, at this point, to appoint Wood. So we went ahead
                    with the appointment, which was a mistake.</p>
                <p>Wood was not only a loose cannon, despite our best efforts, but he began to cause
                    real problems. When he came in, there were some aspects of administrative and
                    financial messiness, although not malfeasance, both in AIT and in Taiwan.
                    Because of this strange and unofficial relationship with Taiwan and its very
                    cumbersome apparatus and financial dealings, handling visas unofficially, and
                    all kinds of things like that, there was a lot of tidying up to be done. Wood
                    pressed hard on that, and some of this was legitimate. However, he was also
                    trying to make something political out of it by saying that his predecessors who
                    had attacked his appointment as the Director of AIT, including David Dean, had
                    screwed things up and maybe even participated in fraud and so forth.</p>
                <p>So Wood was beginning to be nasty about this. More importantly, he was dealing
                    with Taiwan officials without checking with me. This was the way I was supposed
                    to exercise policy control over him. Then, of course, it was uncovered, alleged
                    that he had engaged in illegal, fund-raising activities when he went to Taiwan
                    on behalf of President Clinton and the Democratic Party. I don't know whether
                    that has been proven or whether it's still under investigation.</p>
                <p>In short, Wood caused us a lot of grief. We tried to keep him under control as
                    best we could. Then finally, with my strong encouragement, we moved to get rid
                    of him, which we finally did. Wood held a press conference. He tried to say that
                    we dumped him because we were worried that he was going to uncover malfeasance
                    in AIT. He got very nasty but he got nowhere because he had no credibility.
                    Thus, this assignment of Wood to AIT turned out to be a mistake. Frankly, it
                    didn't cost us much in terms of our Taiwan or China policy. It never had a major
                    foreign policy impact or became a major domestic political issue. But
                    controlling him created a lot of angst. We wrote memos trying to control him and
                    worked with Phillips and Brown in reining him in, but with no great success.</p>
                <p>So this was all a distraction, an annoyance, and a mistake, though it was by no
                    means a disaster. It was just something that shouldn't have happened.</p>
                <p>At this point I enclose my opening talking points at a January 14, 1997 farewell
                    press conference I gave at the Foreign Press Center. It summed up our
                    accomplishments and ongoing challenges.</p>

                <pb facs="0865" n="Page0865"/>
                <p>* In my March 1993 confirmation hearings, I stated that “Today no region in the
                    world is more important for the United States than Asia and the Pacific.
                    Tomorrow, in the twenty- first century, no region will be as important.” My four
                    years as Assistant Secretary have reconfirmed my belief that the world's most
                    promising and dynamic area is Asia and the Pacific.</p>
                <p>* It has been an honor to serve in the Clinton Administration. I believe that
                    this administration can take satisfaction in having laid the groundwork for a
                    more secure, prosperous and free Asia-Pacific.</p>
                <p>* Despite crises elsewhere in the world which often have drawn attention away
                    from events and trends in Asia, the Clinton Administration elevated the region
                    on the foreign policy agenda through the President's Pacific Community vision
                    and addressed Asian fears of U.S. disengagement - through maintaining our force
                    levels, revitalizing our security alliances, lifting APEC to the Leaders level,
                    and shaping regional security dialogues.</p>
                <p>* President Clinton's leadership has been key. His first overseas trip in 1993
                    was to Japan and South Korea, our two allies in Northeast Asia, where he
                    sketched his vision of a Pacific Community. He created an annual leaders' summit
                    at APEC. And his first overseas trip after re-election was to Australia, the
                    Philippines, and Thailand, our other three democratic allies in the region.</p>
                <p>* Let me cite some specific areas of achievement during the firsfour years of the
                    Administration:</p>
                <p>* Under the U.S.-DPRK Agreed Framework, we have frozen - and will eventually
                    dismantle - the most urgent security threat of four years ago, the North Korean
                    nuclear program. We are working with our ROK allies to ensure that the Agreed
                    Framework and Four Party meeting remain the focus for moving towards peace on
                    the Korean peninsula. We have agreement in general among the three parties to
                    meet toward the endof this month for a joint U.S.-ROK briefing on the Four Party
                    process.</p>
                <p>* We have strengthened U.S.-Japan ties, highlighted by the President's April 1996
                    trip with its broad communique of cooperation and reaffirmation of the security
                    alliance. In 1993, we launched the U.S.-Japan Common Agenda for Cooperation in
                    Global Perspective, which ensures close teamwork on pressing global issues such
                    as the environment, health, and science and technology. And we completed the
                    bilateral SACO (Special Action Committee on Okinawa) Okinawa review, including a
                    replacement for Futenma, in December.</p>
                <pb facs="0866" n="Page0866"/>
                <p>* We have put our relationship with China on a firmer foundation, expanding on
                    areas of cooperation and seeking to manage our differences so that individual
                    issues do not upset the entire relationship. We have agreed upon a series of
                    high-level meetings - including an exchange of summits - to propel this
                    relationship forward. We have made some progress on non-proliferation, but we
                    continue to have serious concerns in that area. Human rights remains an area of
                    difference between us; the U.S. will continue to speak out when it sees human
                    rights abuses in China as elsewhere. Opening China's markets to American goods
                    and services remains a priority, and we continue to push for progress; we
                    reached an agreement on the enforcement of intellectual property rights.</p>
                <p>* We have normalized relations with Vietnam, thereby achieving the most
                    cooperation ever on the POW/MIA issue, promoting our security and economic
                    interests, and healing the wounds of our most divisive war. The President has
                    resubmitted former Congressman Peterson's nomination as Ambassador to the
                    Senate, and we expect the Senate to act speedily to confirm him early in the new
                    session.</p>
                <p>* We have supported Cambodia's dramatic progress away from the killing fields -
                    UN elections, return of 370,000 refugees, removal of foreign interference,
                    formation of a coalition government, decimation of the Khmer Rouge threat.</p>
                <p>Massive defections from the Khmer Rouge this past year are proof that even they
                    are beginning to recognize the future lies on the path to democracy and
                    development. Cambodia has embarked on that path thanks to support and leadership
                    by the U.S. along with the rest of the international community.</p>
                <p>Granting of MFN to Cambodia last fall marks full normalization of our economic
                    relations with Cambodia. We hope these efforts encourage greater trade and
                    investment.</p>
                <p>* We maintained strong U.S. pressure and rallied international pressure on the
                    Burmese regime, the SLORC, to urge it to make progress on democracy, human
                    rights, and counter-narcotics. Though the $LORC released Aung San Suu Kyi after
                    six years under house arrest (in part due to international pressure), the regime
                    continues to restrict her activities and has resisted entering a dialogue with
                    her party and the ethnic minorities.</p>
                <p>* We revitalized our relationship with the Philippines (Presidential visits),
                    moving toward a maturing partnership which gives greater significance to
                    pursuing mutual economic benefit, through trade rather than aid. We also
                    consulted closely with the Philippines on how best to pursue our shared
                    commitment to the furtherance of democracy, human rights and other issues of
                    global importance.</p>
                <pb facs="0867" n="Page0867"/>
                <p>* We reaffirmed our strong strong economic and security ties with Thailand with
                    the first Presidential visit since the Vietnam War era and the signing in 1996
                    of new treaties dramatically expanding civilian aviation links and easing tax
                    burdens for entrepreneurs.</p>
                <p>* We reaffirmed security ties with Australia (Presidential visit) and revitalized
                    political ties with New Zealand (without according it allied status).</p>

                        do some profiles of people that you've worked with. I was thinking of the
                        first term, Clinton administration, involving President Clinton, Secretary
                        of State Warren Christopher, and others. So I'll turn you loose and may have
                        some further questions on this subject.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0869" n="Page0869"/>
                <p>LORD: As we sit here on April 27, [1999], I note that I've done profiles on Henry
                    Kissinger, President Nixon, and Mao Zedong, as well as, to a lesser extent, on
                    Zhou En-lai, and Brezhnev. I dealt with Al Haig a little bit, Gromyko a little
                    bit, and so on.</p>
                <p>Let me begin first with the Presidents I've worked with. I've worked with every
                    President since President John Kennedy, except for President Carter, when I left
                    government service to take a break during that period. I didn't meet Presidents
                    Johnson and Kennedy directly or work with them. I was too junior at that time.
                    So President Nixon was the first President that I had extensive interaction
                    with. The next one, of course, was President Ford.</p>
                <p>I went on some trips with President Ford, including his trip to China, Indonesia,
                    and the Philippines. I sat in on some of his meetings but I don't want to
                    exaggerate my exposure to him. I didn't have as much contact with him as I did
                    with Presidents Nixon or Clinton, or even with Reagan. Through Kissinger,
                    through my own observations, and through selective meetings with President Ford,
                    I formed some impressions of him.</p>
                <p>Kissinger has a new book out on sale, which was published in the spring of this
                    1999. It is very laudatory of President Ford. It basically talks about what Ford
                    did to heal the nation after Watergate and to hold the nation together. He talks
                    about Ford's decency in improving the atmosphere, and the political price he
                    paid by pardoning President Nixon for the good of the nation. It may have cost
                    him reelection [in 1976]. Kissinger's book is entitled, “Year of Renewal.” He
                    credits the renewal to President Ford.</p>
                <p>I would grant all of those things to President Ford, certainly including his
                    decency. He was always polite and straightforward. You didn't have to stop to
                    figure him out, as I did with a complicated man such as President Nixon.
                    President Ford came across, in the sense that, “What you saw is what you get.”
                    All of which is to be applauded. I would also, as I say, applaud his “healing
                    function” and his courage in pardoning President Nixon. I would also add, on the
                    positive side, that he showed courage on occasion. For example, in 1976,
                    Kissinger undertook a lot of diplomatic activity in Africa, including trying to
                    bring majority rule to Rhodesia, which came to be known as Zimbabwe. Some of
                    this activity was happening during the Presidential primary campaign, including
                    in Texas and some of the other primaries in the South. Ford was being challenged
                    by Reagan and the conservative wing of the Republican Party. Meanwhile, we were
                    pressing for equal rights for Blacks in Africa, which was not the most popular
                    issue at the time in the U.S. South. To Ford's credit, he explicitly told
                    Kissinger that: “This may hurt me,” in terms of a challenge from the Right wing
                    of the Republican Party in these southern primary elections. He added: “However,
                    you go ahead and do what is correct.” Kissinger moved ahead along this line.</p>
                <pb facs="0870" n="Page0870"/>
                <p>I remember one day when we landed in Senegal, I believe. On the very day that we
                    landed there, Reagan had beaten Ford in the Texas primary election. So, in our
                    usual black humor, some of us on the staff greeted Kissinger by singing: “The
                    eyes of Texas are upon you,” and so on. I make this point to indicate that Ford
                    showed some courage there. I don't want to be negative on Ford. He had these
                    positive dimensions and deserves to get credit for them.</p>
                <p>Having said that, I think that President Ford was not a great man by any means.
                    From what I've read of Kissinger's memoirs, and I've read a lot more in other
                    books about Ford, I think that Kissinger was overly generous toward Ford. I
                    think that Ford had his limitations. This is based on superficial contacts I had
                    with him. I must admit that Ford was nothing but nice to me and was always a
                    decent man. So I hesitate to be critical of him, but in the interest of candor I
                    just think that he was limited in terms of intelligence or conceptual strength.
                    To his credit, he knew his limitations and delegated to Kissinger the basic
                    running of foreign policy. He was able to make some difficult decisions, not
                    only in Africa but on some other issues during his tenure as President.</p>
                <p>First of all, I didn't think that Ford was particularly smart or handled himself
                    all that well in meetings that I attended. More significantly, with respect to
                    his essential decency and courage, this was limited in some respects. Certainly,
                    he was courageous in pardoning President Nixon, and that dwarfs other things. I
                    want to acknowledge that. However, despite Ford's closeness to Kissinger and
                    respect for him, Ford didn't really defend Kissinger very strongly when the
                    Reagan people attacked Kissinger. At the time Ford was watching his right flank.
                    Kissinger did not even go to the Republican convention where Ford was given the
                    Republican nomination for President. Ford knew that Kissinger would be a magnet
                    for conservatives who didn't like Secretary Kissinger and didn't like detente. I
                    just don't feel that Ford was very loyal to Kissinger, any more than President
                    Eisenhower was very loyal to General George Marshall when he was attacked by
                    Senator Joseph McCarthy, though I don't want to compare the two - Ike was a
                    great American and great President. So there was that element.</p>
                <p>What also dismayed me about President Ford was that, in a stupid attempt to
                    appease the right wing of the Republican Party, Ford dropped Nelson Rockefeller
                    as nominee for Vice President. Rockefeller was one of my heroes. He was a
                    moderate Republican. Ford replaced Rockefeller as nominee for Vice President
                    with Bob Dole, whom I didn't particularly like. I felt that that action was both
                    stupid tactically and showed weakness in exaggerating the right wing problem in
                    the Republican Party, particularly as time went on. In any event, this was no
                    way to treat Rockefeller, who had been a loyal Vice President. Rockefeller, to
                    his credit, never complained, either privately or publicly. He was a good
                    soldier. I found that a major mistake on Ford's part. So my own view of
                    President Ford is mixed, and that's really all I have to say about him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for Nelson Rockefeller during the
                        time you were on the NSC staff? As Vice President, Rockefeller went back to
                        the 1940s as far as being involved in Latin American affairs was
                        concerned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: Right. I met Rockefeller on several occasions. I certainly didn't know him
                    well. I had met him superficially on social occasions, as I recall it, when I
                    was younger. I met him through Kissinger and went to his house at least a couple
                    of times but didn't deal with him and sit in on meetings with him while
                    Rockefeller was Vice President, at least as far as I can recall. On the
                    occasions when I did meet him, he struck me as very dynamic, someone who was
                    very gregarious and energetic. Being a moderate Republican, I basically liked
                    his views, although as I look back on it, he advocated perhaps too big a role
                    for government for my taste when I think of his service as Governor of New
                    York.</p>
                <p>I knew of Kissinger's great respect for Rockefeller. I also had great respect for
                    him. Rockefeller seemed to run his political campaigns on the basis of ideas,
                    thinking that he would be nominated for President by issuing policy papers. That
                    is not quite the way you do it. Meanwhile, he risked being cut up by the
                    conservatives and could never quite get through a Republican convention. I was
                    very upset when people like Senator Goldwater beat Rockefeller. I was
                    particularly upset when Rockefeller was booed at the party convention in San
                    Francisco by the Goldwater people. I liked Rockefeller because he was
                    forthcoming on the racial issue and was a strong proponent of integration and
                    equal rights. He was very strong on that. Rockefeller seemed to me to have a
                    kind of vision on foreign policy that Kissinger did, in terms of a combination
                    of firmness but also a willingness to negotiate with our adversaries. America
                    had to play a large, international role. So I was a great fan of Rockefeller's,
                    but I didn't know him well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering whether, during the time that Rockefeller
                        was Vice President [under President Ford] and he was the patron of Henry
                        Kissinger, there was any evidence of the hand of Nelson Rockefeller behind
                        Kissinger?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I don't recall. Kissinger kept Rockefeller posted, because he was Vice
                    President, because he was a close friend of Kissinger's, and because Kissinger
                    had worked for Rockefeller. To Nixon's great credit, he chose Kissinger to be
                    his National Security Adviser. Indeed, as Kissinger tells it, when he was
                    approached by Nixon after the election of 1968 to be National Security Adviser,
                    Kissinger had the effrontery to say to Nixon: “Let me think about it. I'll get
                    back to you.” He was thinking about whether to take a chance and work for Nixon.
                    After all, he'd been with Rockefeller, he'd been with the Harvard University
                    liberal intellectual crowd, even though he wasn't a liberal himself. He was
                    wondering whether he would be criticized and would feel awkward, working for
                    Nixon after he had opposed him in the primary campaign. Rockefeller, of course,
                    generally came out of the Harvard, etc. milieu, which was suspicious of
                    Nixon.</p>
                <pb facs="0872" n="Page0872"/>
                <p>Kissinger went to Rockefeller, and Rockefeller said: “Look, Nixon is taking a
                    much bigger chance by appointing you than you would be taking by joining him.
                    After all, he has his own perspective. You've worked for me. You're a Harvard
                    intellectual.” I don't know exactly whether Rockefeller said that Kissinger was
                    a Jewish immigrant, but he said, more or less, that if Nixon was willing to take
                    a chance on Kissinger, how could Kissinger have the effrontery to tell the next
                    President of the United States that he would think about it and get back to him.
                    Rockefeller said to Kissinger: “Call Nixon right away and say that you accept.”
                    And that's exactly what Kissinger did. Kissinger tells this story himself about
                    his reaction to the offer from Nixon and Rockefeller's comments.</p>
                <p>That's the approach Rockefeller had. The other approach was that Rockefeller
                    never expressed bitterness, either publicly or privately, about being dropped as
                    Vice Presidential candidate by President Ford. Rockefeller remained loyal to
                    Ford, even though it must have been a bitter blow to someone who wanted to be
                    President. He probably thought that his best bet was to succeed Ford as
                    President, after being Vice President, never envisaging the humiliation of being
                    dropped from the ticket.</p>
                <p>The next President I dealt with was Ronald Reagan. As I said, I left government
                    service in 1977 and therefore didn't serve during the Carter Administration.</p>

                <p>LORD: I should talk about Carter. I knew him superficially. I didn't know him
                    very well before he became President, although I believe that I had met him. I
                    was attracted to Carter in the sense that he looked to me like a moderate
                    Democrat from the South. I'm a centrist myself. Throughout my lifetime, I have
                    voted almost exactly 50 - 50 for Republicans and Democrats. I stayed away from
                    Senators Goldwater [Republican, AZ] and McGovern [Democrat, ND] and generally
                    voted for candidates from the center, whether moderate Republicans or moderate
                    Democrats. Even though it's a secret ballot, I'll be very honest and say that I
                    was sufficiently unhappy with President Ford dropping Rockefeller from the
                    Republican ticket in 1976, as well as other dimensions of his record that I
                    didn't approve of, and was sufficiently intrigued by Carter, even though I
                    didn't know much about him, that I actually voted for Carter in the 1976
                    Presidential election. I did this, even though it meant that if Carter won and
                    Ford lost, I'd be leaving government service. In fact, I wanted to leave anyway.
                    I was exhausted, and this prospect didn't bother me.</p>
                <p>So, superficially, I was attracted by Carter. Since then, I have met him in
                    various milieus. I met him even during the Clinton administration, when he
                    negotiated on the Korean issue. I met him when he came to China, when I was
                    Ambassador. I saw him at the Carter Center in Atlanta once. I've also been at
                    meetings where I hosted him at the Council on Foreign Relations at which he or
                    his wife spoke. I have met him and have some impression of him, even though I
                    didn't work directly for him.</p>
                <p>None of these impressions will represent a particularly revolutionary analysis.
                    There is no question that President Carter is very smart in a detailed, tactical
                    way. I think that the conventional wisdom is correct, that he was terrific on
                    details but he paid too much attention to them. Unlike any other President or a
                    busy executive, he would not only read the full memoranda sent to him, but he
                    would read the annexes and attachments, even though they were bulky. He would
                    get to know a subject intimately. However, the problem was that he would know
                    the trees but would no longer know the forest. It is rumored that Carter even
                    scheduled appointments on the White House tennis courts. I find that hard to
                    believe, although as a great tennis fan, that's probably not a bad idea. So
                    there is that aspect. He was a bright, smart engineer.</p>
                <pb facs="0874" n="Page0874"/>
                <p>There is no question that on Korea Carter was very helpful to the Clinton
                    administration, and I've gone into that in a previous interview. Carter is
                    sharp. In retrospect, I give him more credit than I did at the time for giving
                    us a new emphasis on human rights in our foreign policy. In the 1970s, and when
                    Carter became President, I was still more of the realpolitik school of
                    Kissinger. I was more interested in human rights than Henry Kissinger was, but
                    that's not a very high barrier to leap over. I tended to agree that, on the
                    whole, you worry more about the foreign policies of foreign countries than you
                    do about their domestic systems. I have greatly evolved in my thinking. I think
                    that human rights are a legitimate item in our foreign policy agenda and an
                    important item with any country. We need to look at human rights carefully, not
                    only to maintain domestic and Congressional support, but also to reflect our
                    values and to include idealism as well as pragmatism in our foreign policy.
                    Above all, I think that this concern for human rights also advances our security
                    interests because more open, democratic nations are less aggressive and less apt
                    to produce wars. They don't generate refugees, they don't practice terrorism,
                    and they are less involved in the drug traffic. Therefore, there are concrete
                    security and other benefits to be gained from promoting democracy and human
                    rights in foreign countries, in addition to humane considerations.</p>
                <p>Also, in the age of the Internet, fax machines, satellites, and computers, I
                    don't think that you can develop an economy effectively without a more
                    democratic, law-based, open, transparent society. If you don't do this, you're
                    going to fall behind at some point in your development. So, for all of these
                    reasons, I am now convinced that human rights and democracy are legitimate aims
                    of our foreign policy. They are not the only aim, and cannot dominate all other
                    considerations, whether it is with China or any other country. However,
                    promoting freedom as such is an important aim of foreign policy. I feel that
                    more strongly than Kissinger did. I feel that more strongly than I did when I
                    was judging the performance of President Carter. At the time I thought that
                    Carter was probably pushing human rights too much.</p>
                <p>Of course, President Carter has been a terrific, ex-President. He deserves the
                    kudos he has gotten for his humanitarian work, his important efforts at the
                    Carter Center in Georgia, as well as some of the selective diplomacy he has
                    engaged in, including Korea. At other times I think that he has been too
                    generous toward real dictators and, as a human rights advocate, has tended to
                    overlook some of their excesses. Sometimes, he has meddled in some issues
                    without cooperating fully with the U.S. Government. So his record has been a
                    mixed bag. However, on the whole, you have to give him credit for his
                    performance as an ex-President.</p>
                <p>As for his presidency on foreign policy, clearly by the end with the hostage
                    crisis and oil problems, he was on the defensive and looked weak. But you have
                    to give him credit for at least three major achievements which people tend to
                    forget: the Panama Canal Treaty, which took great courage. The Camp David Middle
                    East Peace Accords. Normalization of relations with China. That's
                    impressive.</p>
                <pb facs="0875" n="Page0875"/>
                <p>Having said that, I think that he falls short, certainly on personality grounds.
                    He has no sense of humor and is very egotistical. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>One example of Carter not being overly generous involves his visiting Beijing in
                    the late 1980s, when I was Ambassador there. We had a good visit with him and
                    Mrs. Carter. However, in the course of a series of banquets and luncheons, where
                    the hosts were Chinese, there would be toasts to U.S.-Chinese relations,
                    including Carter's contribution to normalizing relations in 1979, for which he
                    deserves credit. However, there I was sitting there, the current Ambassador to
                    China who had been involved in the opening of relations with China with
                    Kissinger and President Nixon and who would like to think that he made his own
                    contributions to reopening U.S. relations with China. However, not once,
                    throughout this visit, in any of his toasts or public comments, or even private
                    comments, to Chinese, when he was talking about the development of U.S.-Chinese
                    relations, did he talk about anything but his own contributions. He never
                    acknowledged what Nixon and Kissinger, and, to a certain extent, what the
                    serving U.S. Ambassador, who was his host, had done. I don't want to exaggerate
                    this, but this shows a certain lack of grace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It essentially shows a character flaw.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I think so and I also think that it's dumb in terms of the Chinese. They
                    remember old friends. They give Carter credit for what he did but they also give
                    President Nixon and Henry Kissinger a lot of credit. It would have been more
                    graceful, and the Chinese would have respected him more, if he had mentioned
                    that. I don't want to exaggerate this, but I think that President Carter has a
                    tendency toward self-righteousness, pomposity, and a lack of humor. He has
                    always been very decent to me. He has never been impolite to me. He is bright,
                    and I think that he knows it. But he doesn't spread generosity around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving up the line of the Presidents, did you have any
                        feel for the role of the Presidents' wives, as we go through this review?
                        Did you have any dealings with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I really can't comment on the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. I've
                    always felt that Jackie Kennedy [Mrs. John F. Kennedy] was overrated. Why she
                    should have put up with what her husband did, I'll never understand. Mrs. Lyndon
                    Johnson, of course, put up with what her husband did, as well, but I think that
                    she was formidable. She is one of my favorites as First Lady. I think that she
                    has great strength of character. Mrs. Nixon, of course, was an enigma, very shy,
                    and obviously didn't like the public life of a First Lady. She was living with a
                    complex person, but I only met her very superficially and never really got to
                    know her. The same is true of Mrs. Ford. I didn't know her as well. Of course,
                    she was struggling with alcoholism at that time and was not very prominent. As
                    far as the First Ladies that I knew, these were all women who didn't expose
                    themselves very much to outsiders.</p>
                <pb facs="0876" n="Page0876"/>
                <p>Now, I got to know Mrs. Carter during their trip to China. I also hosted her at
                    the Council on Foreign Relations in the late 1970s. I was quite impressed with
                    her. She was just as smart as her husband. She had a warmer edge to her than her
                    husband did. She was a little more friendly and a little more generous. It was
                    clear during their trip to China that there was tension between the Carters at
                    that point. I think that they had a very good marriage, but they had just
                    co-authored a book, and they admitted themselves that during the writing of that
                    book, they disagreed a great deal. I recall that during this trip to China in
                    the late 1980s that she tried to show her annoyance with President Carter in the
                    following way. The Chinese always kept to a very tight time table. When you go
                    to the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, the Guest House, or some other place
                    for a meeting or a dinner, they don't make you start too soon and then expect
                    you to wait around. They leave just in time, so you get there on time.</p>
                <p>My wife is convinced that, on at least one occasion, Mrs. Carter went into the
                    ladies room just before we were to leave and stayed there for 10 or 15 minutes.
                    There was nothing wrong with her physically. She just wanted to make her husband
                    concerned about being late for the next event on the schedule. My wife had to go
                    in and sort of get Mrs. Carter out of there. So that was an amusing footnote.
                    Mrs. Carter struck me as a very able person. I respected her.</p>
                <p>That brings us up to President Reagan. First, as I think I mentioned earlier, I
                    think that we were chosen partly by Mrs. Reagan, as well as by the President to
                    go to China, because she had read my wife's novel, “Spring Moon.” She loved it
                    and pointed out to her husband that if I were to be appointed Ambassador to
                    China, the U.S. Government would have two people for the price of one, as my
                    wife is Chinese and would add a great dimension to my assignment. I always found
                    Mrs. Reagan very approachable. I basically saw only her good qualities. I had no
                    doubt that she would be so fiercely loyal to her husband that, if you ever
                    crossed her, you would be in deep trouble. She could be tough but she struck me
                    as someone who was really quite gracious in our various encounters, and I had
                    many of them. She seemed friendly. I always felt that she was so loyal to her
                    husband and so worried about his place in history that she was a moderating
                    influence on issues like dealing with the Soviet Union. She wanted President
                    Reagan to go down in history as a peacemaker. In that sense I think that she was
                    probably helpful. I have no doubt that you could get into trouble if you weren't
                    fiercely loyal to the President.</p>
                <pb facs="0877" n="Page0877"/>
                <p>Reagan himself presents an interesting phenomenon personally. I have always said
                    that I was a moderate Republican and still am. That's almost an oxymoron as we
                    speak in 1999. However, I always distrusted the Right wing of the Republican
                    Party. I thought that, to some extent, it had a racist dimension, even if it was
                    unintentional. In some cases right wing Republicans were isolationist and in
                    other cases they were nationalistic and confrontational in a way that was not
                    effective in foreign policy, when we needed a balance of firmness in
                    negotiations and cooperation. I didn't know that much about Reagan when he was
                    Governor of California. However, as he began to aim for the Presidency, first
                    challenging Ford and later when he actually was elected President, I really
                    wasn't a fan of his. I was a Rockefeller or Nixon supporter. I felt that they
                    were people more toward the center of the Republican Party. I didn't expect that
                    I would think highly of Reagan.</p>
                <p>However, by the time he ran against President Carter, because of the Iranian
                    hostage crisis and what I thought was a very poor response to that event, as
                    well as some economic problems in the U.S., I actually got to the point where I
                    voted for Reagan. However, I had some concerns about his outlook, including his
                    policy toward Taiwan which, at that point, threatened to cause a problem with
                    China. Nevertheless, I figured that, once he entered office as President, he
                    would see, as his predecessors and successors have, that we had a great interest
                    in working with and trying to deal with the Chinese, even though we had to “hold
                    our noses” at times. I also thought that people like then Secretary of State Al
                    Haig and others would be working on him to follow the example of his
                    predecessors. Indeed, this is an interesting phenomenon. In successive
                    presidential elections we have seen the challenger to the sitting President
                    attack him as being too soft on China. Once the new President gets into power,
                    after a year or so in office, he has adopted the policies of his predecessor
                    toward China.</p>
                <p>President Carter attacked Kissinger and Nixon for sucking up to the Chinese and
                    being too soft after reading some of the transcripts of meetings with the
                    Chinese. Carter, of course, normalized relations with China after some initial
                    lean toward the Soviets. He promoted the relationship with China, and this is to
                    his credit.</p>
                <p>Some Republicans, although not the great bulk of them, attacked Carter for
                    selling out Taiwan. However, Carter was attacked by Reagan regarding his Taiwan
                    policy which, he charged, was much too soft. Reagan gave great emphasis to this
                    issue. Of course, after he was elected President and had been in office for a
                    couple of years, and the 1982 Communique of Taiwan arms sales was negotiated,
                    Reagan than went to China, and he moved China policy forward, as his
                    predecessors had done. Reagan was followed by President Bush, who endorsed his
                    policy toward China but ran into early trouble because of the 1989 Tiananmen
                    Square massacre.</p>
                <pb facs="0878" n="Page0878"/>
                <p>Then President Clinton came along, and he bashed President Bush for being too
                    soft on China, particularly in the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre. He
                    conditioned MFN [Most Favored Nation] trade on Chinese improvement in the field
                    of human rights. Then, after a year or two, President Clinton changed his policy
                    toward China and moved more toward the policies of his predecessors as
                    President.</p>
                <p>So this has been a recurring phenomenon and makes for an interesting
                    footnote.</p>
                <p>I developed a growing respect for President Reagan, which continues to this day.
                    I'm not one to mythologize or eulogize him and ascribe to him heroic,
                    Churchillean accomplishments, as some of his worshipers do. Having said that, I
                    think that Reagan proved that there are certain qualities that are more
                    important than being brilliant. Of the Presidents I dealt with, I'd say that
                    Reagan and Ford seemed to me to be the least intelligent in the conventional
                    sense. Nixon, Carter and Clinton, it seemed to me, are the most intelligent,
                    with Bush somewhere in between. There is no question that in meetings I sat in
                    on with Reagan, mostly on China, because I was Ambassador then, he would follow
                    his cue cards. He would follow his script, at times somewhat mechanically. So I
                    didn't feel that there was a great mind at work here, something like Nixon on
                    foreign policy or Carter on details, and so on. However, Reagan proved that if
                    you have a certain few principles and convictions and you stick to them, and
                    don't bend with the wind and consult the public opinion polls, as Clinton has
                    done, you can get some things done. Perhaps the single largest achievement of
                    Reagan was to restore the spirit and confidence of the American people,
                    especially after Carter's period of “malaise,” economic problems, oil shocks,
                    and American hostages. Observers were saying that the American presidency was
                    fatally weakened. Reagan disproved all that and showed that a President could do
                    great things. His optimism, faith in America, strength of character, fidelity to
                    his principles all made a huge difference in the American psyche in addition to
                    his specific accomplishments.</p>
                <p>In addition of course he was one of the great orators and could lift his
                    audiences, whether at a time of national tragedy like the American Challenger
                    space tragedy or telling the Russians to tear down the Berlin Wall. Of course
                    speechwriters like Peggy Noonan - or Ted Sorensen for Kennedy - deserve great
                    credit.</p>
                <pb facs="0879" n="Page0879"/>
                <p>The economy did well under President Reagan. Of course, he also helped to bring
                    about the end of the Cold War. Now, I give great credit for this to Secretary of
                    State George Shultz, and I'll come back to this later on. I'm not sure that
                    President Reagan could have done it by himself. There's no question that he was
                    tough and firm with the Soviets. He built up our defenses. He went too far with
                    the idea of Star Wars [which he called the “Strategic Defense Initiative,” or
                    SDI]. This was a crazy idea which sought to build up a perfect shield to protect
                    the U.S. However, by stretching the economy of the Soviet Union and the ability
                    of the Soviets to keep up with us technologically, it certainly helped to bring
                    down the Soviet Union. Under the influence of Secretary of State George Shultz,
                    Mrs. Reagan, and some others, he used the assets available to him with the
                    buildup of our defenses and technology drive to create further leverage on the
                    Soviets and also negotiate with them. He helped to bring about the demise of the
                    Soviet Union and was helped in this regard by the administration of President
                    George Bush. The rottenness of the Soviet system had an awful lot to do with
                    this, so that not all of the credit for this should go to President Reagan.</p>
                <p>The policies of Reagan's predecessors also had a lot to do with this, including
                    those of Nixon and Kissinger and, to a certain extent, those of President
                    Carter. So, no one person deserves credit for our victory in the Cold War, but
                    certainly President Reagan deserves and is getting much credit. I've changed my
                    mind about Reagan. He showed good judgment in choosing people like Secretary of
                    State George Shultz and using them effectively. He showed a willingness to
                    adjust to changing circumstances, as he did in the cases of Taiwan and China, as
                    he did on negotiating with the Soviets, and on maintaining his principles. I
                    think that all of that is a plus. I still can't figure out how culpable he was
                    in the matter of exchanging arms for American Embassy hostages in Iran, which I
                    thought was a disgraceful episode. However, Reagan was always vague, and he
                    managed to slip through that, because of his vagueness. He has to be held
                    responsible for the Iran-Contra affair, and that is a major mark against him. It
                    was outrageous to be dealing with Iran in that way, not to mention possible
                    violations of law by subordinates and a possible coverup because of Reagan's
                    vagueness.</p>
                <p>However, on the whole, I would give Reagan very high marks. I would give him
                    lower marks on what he did on our budgetary deficit. The term “voodoo economics”
                    is true. You cannot raise defense spending, which I think we needed to do, cut
                    taxes, and say that you are going to get a balanced budget. This just can't be
                    done. On the whole, I think that Reagan deserves great credit and I would
                    certainly put him above Ford or Carter as President. Nixon was much more
                    brilliant in the field of foreign policy and had much more dramatic achievements
                    in some respects, although, because of the Watergate Affair, you have to rank
                    him lower in terms of his overall performance.</p>
                <pb facs="0880" n="Page0880"/>
                <p>Next came President Bush (Senior). This is the mirror image of my evolving view
                    of President Reagan. I went from negative to positive on Reagan. I did just the
                    opposite in evaluating President Bush. Again, I'm a moderate Republican and
                    therefore, for that and many other reasons, George Bush appealed to me greatly.
                    I had known him and played tennis with him. I had known some members of his
                    family favorably and well. He was a WASP [White Anglo-Saxon Protestant] like
                    myself. He went to Yale, as I did. He was in the Skull and Bones, a secret
                    society at Yale like myself. He was a moderate Republican and seemed like an
                    eminently decent guy. When he went to China as one of the first chiefs of the
                    U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing before we had full diplomatic relations with
                    China, I was in charge of getting him ready to go to China on behalf of
                    Kissinger. I briefed him and took him around to call on a number of people. I
                    was very impressed, not only with his enthusiasm but his ability to absorb the
                    various dimensions of China policy. I thought that he did an enthusiastic job in
                    Beijing, even though there wasn't much that he could do in terms of policy. He
                    was kept on a tight leash by President Nixon and Kissinger. The Chinese didn't
                    allow him a great deal of access in Beijing in a still very restricted
                    environment. So, for all of these reasons, I was a fan of George Bush before he
                    became President.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, when he was Vice President under Reagan and I was Ambassador to
                    China, almost every time when I came back to Washington for consultations or
                    when I was accompanying a Chinese leader, such as a Vice Premier, on a trip to
                    the United States, I would see Vice President Bush. He was one of the hosts of
                    the Chinese leaders. He would host either a dinner or a lunch in honor of the
                    visitor, in addition to entertainment by the President, if it was appropriate,
                    depending on the level of the visitor. But I would see Vice President Bush on my
                    own, just as an old friend to bring him up to date on China, in which he was
                    very interested. He had had the same driver that I had in China. He wanted to
                    hear about his old friends in Beijing, as well as talk about policy issues.
                    There was always a very full exchange of views, back and forth. He was very
                    friendly, so I was a great fan of George Bush.</p>
                <p>I voted for George Bush and thought that he would be a terrific President. I also
                    thought, very naively as it turned out, and I have covered this point elsewhere,
                    that I would get a high level job with George Bush. There were rumors in the
                    press that I might be National Security Adviser to President George Bush. Bill
                    Safire, “Newsweek,” and others suggested key jobs were awaiting me. It was
                    reported that I was favored to be appointed CIA Director, which was absurd.
                    Someone else had me down for appointment as Deputy Secretary of State. There
                    were a lot of rumors going around. I didn't know what I'd be, but I was pretty
                    sure that I would be up for a pretty high level job, given my good relationship
                    with George Bush and the fact that I thought that I had done well on China, as
                    well as during the rest of my career.</p>
                <pb facs="0881" n="Page0881"/>
                <p>I want to emphasize genuinely that the fact that I did not get a high level job
                    is not the reason why I changed my mind on George Bush. I changed my mind on
                    Bush because of his trip to China, which we've covered at great length elsewhere
                    in this interview, so I won't repeat myself. Basically, leading up to this Bush
                    trip to China, I wrote personal memos for him and personal profiles on policy,
                    which I thought were very good. His advance people thought that I and the
                    embassy had done a terrific job. So everything up until that trip to China was
                    positive, as far as my view of George Bush was concerned. By then I had found
                    out that I wasn't going to get a high level job working for Bush, but that
                    didn't affect my view of him. Frankly, I was disappointed and puzzled, but this
                    didn't change my positive view of Bush for all of the reasons that I have
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>I changed my view of Bush as a result of his trip to China in February, 1989. My
                    views regarding Bush on that will be found elsewhere in this interview. It
                    completely soured me on his character.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Tiananmen Square incident occurred in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: June, 1989. Bush's trip to China took place in February, 1989, right after
                    his inauguration as President. I've covered that and his weakness in the face of
                    the Fang Lizhi incident and his sending Brent Scowcroft [National Security
                    Adviser] to do a press backgrounder which was totally inaccurate and which
                    attacked me and my Embassy.</p>
                <p>That annoyed me, both on personal grounds, which is only human, but also, and
                    more importantly, in terms of a general weakness toward the Chinese and a
                    general lack of character.</p>
                <p>As time went on, after I left government service, I felt that President Bush had
                    been very weak in response to the Tiananmen Square massacre. So I was
                    increasingly disillusioned with him. I admired what Bush did in terms of Desert
                    Storm [victorious campaign in the Gulf War in 1991], for which he deserved great
                    credit. He marshaled public opinion and had the courage to intervene there. He
                    maintained a complicated alliance with several countries in fighting that war. I
                    think that President Bush was right not to march on Baghdad. We would have been
                    bogged down. But I think he should have continued the fighting for a couple of
                    more days and decimated the Iraqi Republican Guard. And he should have provided
                    air cover for the rebelling Kurds and Shiites. However, on the whole, he
                    deserves the credit he's gotten for that. I think that he managed the transition
                    from the Cold War after President Reagan very well. Certainly, he supported the
                    unification of Germany effectively and dealt with Soviet President Gorbachev at
                    a time when the Soviet empire was crumbling, and the Communist Party of the
                    Soviet Union was losing control in that country. He made sure that the Soviets
                    didn't feel “cornered” and that they were able to save some face. So there was a
                    peaceful denouement to this situation. President Bush deserved credit for many
                    developments in foreign policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0882" n="Page0882"/>
                <p>As I said, I thought that Bush was increasingly weak on China. I became steadily
                    more impatient with him on that front, to the point where finally, after
                    hesitating, I began to speak out against Scowcroft's trips to China after the
                    Tiananmen Square massacre, as well as his general softness versus Beijing. I
                    became more and more critical of President Bush and also more disillusioned with
                    him. I also felt more generally, as an American citizen, that Bush largely
                    ignored domestic policy because he was so interested in foreign policy.
                    Essentially, I believe that's why Bush was not reelected. People thought that he
                    was ignoring domestic issues. So in that respect I thought that Bush was
                    delinquent. More generally, I began to see a weakness in Bush's character, in
                    contrast to Reagan. I reached the point where I admired President Reagan a lot
                    more and President Bush a lot less.</p>
                <p>I had been a fan of Mrs. Bush as well. However, she has a public reputation
                    beyond what she deserves, in my opinion. She is one tough lady. Never mind about
                    her being tough. I'm in favor of that. But she can be quite nasty and was to my
                    wife, during President Bush's trip to China. So I generally have a less elevated
                    view of her than the general grandmotherly vision that she projects to the
                    American body politic.</p>
                <p>That brings us to President Clinton. Of course, President Clinton swung too far
                    in the other direction and did so much in the field of domestic policy early in
                    his first term that he didn't pay enough attention to foreign policy. By the
                    time the election campaign of 1992 rolled around, I was critical in private and
                    in public of Bush on China and was generally disillusioned with his character as
                    I saw it. Clinton appealed to me the way that Carter had many years before. That
                    is, he appeared to be a moderate, centrist Democrat. As I said, I was
                    disillusioned with Bush. I served Democrats and Republicans. It appeared to me
                    that Clinton was not a left wing Democrat by any means. And he clearly was
                    bright.</p>
                <p>I knew something of his background as a womanizer and some of his weaknesses,
                    obviously his evasions on the Vietnam War, as well as the Jennifer Flowers
                    affair. It was clear to me that Clinton was not a perfect human being. I'm very
                    old-fashioned on marriage vows, and I didn't approve of his behavior. However, I
                    understand that Clinton's behavior was irrelevant to other people. People
                    disagree on the importance of that, and certainly they say that this is not a
                    crucial matter for a President. A lot of Presidents have been in trouble in this
                    respect. Clinton was not my first choice among the Democrats, but once he became
                    the nominee of the Democratic Party, I preferred him over George Bush.</p>
                <pb facs="0883" n="Page0883"/>
                <p>Indeed, I met with him once on Japan and China policy during the 1992 election
                    campaign around Labor Day, 1992, and this has been documented elsewhere. I was
                    extremely impressed with this first meeting with Clinton, and he has made a good
                    impact on many people. Among his characteristics are his intelligence and his
                    clever answers to questions. He is a good listener. He is also charming,
                    friendly, and open. When I walked into the room to meet him, he said: “Strobe
                    Talbott [now Deputy Secretary of State] speaks very highly of you.” I didn't
                    know that Strobe Talbott, who is a good friend of mine, was also a Rhodes
                    Scholar, as Clinton was, and is very close to Clinton. Presumably, Talbott
                    mentioned me to Clinton as someone to keep in mind for a future position.</p>
                <p>I had a favorable exchange with President Clinton on China and Japan, voted for
                    him, and came into the Clinton administration enthusiastically. By now, I am
                    totally disillusioned with Clinton as we speak here in the spring of 1999. I had
                    mixed feelings while I was working for Clinton. On the whole, I had a positive
                    attitude toward him. Clinton did some good things. I liked the fact that, for
                    whatever calculating, poll taking, triangulating reasons, Clinton had moved to
                    the center and committed himself to welfare reform and balancing the budget. I
                    think that the Republicans also deserve a lot of credit for that. I was
                    frustrated about Clinton's lack of systematic attention to foreign policy during
                    the first couple of years of his first term. I felt that he was right, that
                    domestic policy had the highest priority after the Bush administration, and I
                    thought that if the Clinton administration was strong domestically, that would
                    help him in the foreign policy field. So Clinton clearly wanted to make domestic
                    affairs his major priority.</p>
                <p>Having said that, I found that Clinton was a little too sporadic in foreign
                    policy for my taste. We encouraged him to host the first APEC [Asia-Pacific
                    Economic Conference] summit meeting in Seattle in November, 1993, which was an
                    important element in our Asian policy. We managed to use his calendar for that
                    reason during the first year of his first term. Also, in July, 1993, we were
                    able to arrange for President Clinton to go to Japan and South Korea on his
                    first, overseas trip, because there was a meeting of the G7 [seven most highly
                    industrialized countries in the world] in Tokyo. We managed to get him involved
                    in Asian affairs early by using the calendar. But he was sporadically involved
                    in foreign policy issues generally early in his Administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0884" n="Page0884"/>
                <p>I was most frustrated with President Clinton on his China policy. After I had
                    negotiated a deal with Congress with moderate conditions on MFN renewal, the
                    economic agencies undercut us and showed division in our government to Beijing,
                    undercutting our leverage. The President never disciplined his Cabinet and made
                    them support his own policy. Then when Secretary of State Warren Christopher
                    went to China early in 1994, it was the last chance to get the Chinese to make
                    progress on human rights, so that we could renew MFN [Most Favored Nation]
                    treatment for China. We had a chance to advance enough to say that they had met
                    minimum conditions for MFN treatment for China. This was a very tough trip to
                    China, which I have described elsewhere. The Chinese cracked down hard on
                    dissidents. We tried for a week or two to get President Clinton to issue a
                    statement supporting Christopher and making clear to the Chinese that the
                    turbulence in China was the fault of the Chinese Government and that the
                    President was backing up Secretary of State Christopher. However, we couldn't
                    get a single statement out of the White House by President Clinton or the White
                    House, backing Christopher. This clearly undercut Secretary of State Christopher
                    at the time. It gave the Chinese every incentive to hang tough on human
                    rights.</p>
                <p>Also annoying to me was the fact that throughout his first term President Clinton
                    never made a speech on China. I tried mightily to get him to give one. Now,
                    China is one of the most complex relationships that we have, probably THE most
                    complex. You have to explain to an American audience why engagement with China
                    is in our interest and why engagement is not appeasement or rolling over. We
                    need a mixture of firmness in negotiation and cooperation. Our relationship with
                    China will continue to be a mixed relationship, both sweet and sour. That can
                    only be handled by a President, articulating a strategic approach, which
                    President Clinton never did during his first term. We had a policy of engagement
                    with China, which my staff and I had advocated in a memo prepared in September,
                    1993. It looked very much like what we're doing today, as we speak. However, we
                    never got President Clinton to present this policy. He and his political
                    advisers always calculated that this topic was too sensitive to treat in a
                    speech.</p>
                <p>We convinced Secretary of State Christopher to make long comments on China, but a
                    Secretary of State never gets the attention that a President does. So that just
                    documents the fact that President Clinton was an in and outer on foreign policy,
                    and our foreign policy during the first couple of years of the Clinton
                    administration suffered as a result. I'll get back to this when I get to
                    Secretary of State Christopher, but we were much more successful in 1995 and
                    1996 on several fronts. We stumbled early on policy toward Somalia, Haiti, and
                    Bosnia. We had to reverse ourselves on China, and there were some serious
                    problems early in the Clinton administration. Then Christopher got much better
                    afterwards, as did the Administration generally on foreign policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0885" n="Page0885"/>
                <p>Nevertheless, despite this mixed review, I always liked President Clinton in
                    terms of his charm, his warmth, and the feeling that he was engaged with you. I
                    considered President Clinton extremely bright. He is the smartest President that
                    I ever worked with. He is also the dumbest President that I ever worked with,
                    and I'll get back to that. In terms of his smartness, I've never seen a
                    President who could absorb issues so quickly and put this understanding to good
                    use. The most concrete example of this was getting him ready for high level
                    meetings, in my case, with Asian leaders. Whether the meeting was in California
                    or at the White House, at an APEC summit meeting, the UN, or wherever it was,
                    you are supposed to have time before a given meeting to get the President ready.
                    This is not always literally the case. You don't know whether the President has
                    read his briefing book. You don't know sometimes how much he had grasped of the
                    leader he is meeting with or the issues involved.</p>
                <p>In some cases we had interagency briefings of Clinton, sometimes with outside
                    experts, a week or two before a trip or meeting. But usually just before the
                    meetings themselves, with all of his advisers waiting around, Clinton usually
                    ran late. He would be available for briefing purposes with only 10 or 15 minutes
                    to go before the meeting instead of the hour scheduled. At this point I would
                    worry greatly that he won't know enough or know what to do. For example, there
                    were times in the Oval Office [of the President] when you would have, say,
                    Secretary of State Christopher there and maybe also the Secretary of the
                    Treasury or the Secretary of Defense and the National Security Adviser,
                    depending on what the issues and who his interlocutor was. His chief of staff
                    and his press adviser, McCurry, or whoever it was, would also be standing around
                    him. All of them would be trying to get in a few words about what he had to do
                    on this issue, that issue, how to handle the press, and the kind of questions he
                    was going to get. There would also be advice on how President Clinton should
                    conduct the meeting. It was especially awkward for me because I had a superior,
                    Secretary of State Christopher, present at such a time. There wasn't much that I
                    could say, particularly when my boss was there, although Christopher is a very
                    decent man and didn't mind it too much.</p>
                <p>So we would be sitting around a table or standing near the President's desk in
                    the Oval Office. There were about 10 or 15 minutes to go, with perhaps five
                    people talking at once. President Clinton would be shuffling his cue cards
                    containing his talking points. You didn't know what the hell was going to
                    happen. So what happened? He went into the meeting and performed brilliantly. He
                    not only knows the issues as well as you do. He knows how to conduct the
                    meeting. For example, he would start off with a fairly warm and friendly
                    approach, depending on the circumstances. I am generalizing, but he would be
                    relatively friendly and cooperative during this early part of the meeting. Then
                    the tough or difficult issues that he would have to grapple with, or the
                    warnings or problems he would want to raise, he would put in the middle. Then he
                    would make sure that he ended up on a positive note again for face or mood
                    reasons. He didn't want to start off or end negatively. This is pretty
                    elementary as an example of an A-100 course in diplomacy or negotiations.
                    However, President Clinton had an instinct for this, and I use it as an example.
                    He not only knew the issues but would also handle them in the right
                    sequence.</p>
                <pb facs="0886" n="Page0886"/>
                <p>That was one of his strong parts, and I use it as an example of President
                    Clinton's brilliance in absorbing the details affecting complex issues and
                    giving them back to the visitor. He had a slight weakness. I think that he
                    wasn't tough enough at some of the meetings. For example, with the Japanese on
                    economic issues or the Chinese on human rights. He had a certain tendency of
                    wanting to be liked by his interlocutor. Particularly in terms of meetings with
                    the Japanese and Chinese, I felt that he wasn't quite firm enough at times on
                    some of the issues.</p>
                <p>So when I left the Clinton administration at the end of 1996, it certainly wasn't
                    because of Clinton himself. I had no particular complaints. I felt that our
                    foreign policy was in much better shape than it had been when I entered office
                    [as Assistant Secretary of State in 1993]. I certainly felt that our policy
                    toward Asia was in good shape. The China summit meeting was scheduled, and
                    relations with China were on track. We had come out of a crisis with China
                    related to the Taiwan missile crisis. President Clinton had had a very
                    successful visit to Japan, where he had handled himself very well. I was with
                    him on that trip as well, of course, as I was on all of his Asian trips. I had
                    also sat in with him in Oval Office meetings, as well as meetings on Air Force
                    One. I had had a lot of exposure to Clinton. I liked him personally and thought
                    that he was a good President in many ways.</p>
                <p>We had also normalized diplomatic relations with the Socialist Republic of
                    Vietnam. APEC meetings were moving ahead, and regional security and a lot of
                    other things were going well on the Asian front. We had the Korean Framework
                    Agreement. We had terrific relations with Australia and had greatly improved
                    relations with New Zealand. We were doing well with ASEAN. Also Mongolia.</p>
                <p>Since I've been out of office for more than two years now, I've learned, as has
                    the rest of America, including some of his closest advisers, that President
                    Clinton has some fundamental, character flaws. When I worked with him, I went
                    through a period of semi-denial that this was so, as was the case with some of
                    those advisers. Maybe I was naive not to have known this, but if I didn't fully
                    understand this, how about George Stephanopoulos [former key staff for Clinton]
                    and others, who claim not to have fully understood it either? Well, without
                    going into a great deal of detail which is particularly relevant to this record,
                    I have learned of the coverups and lying to the American people and violations
                    of the law by the nation's chief law enforcement officer. This is now confirmed
                    by the judge, who has concluded that Clinton appears to be guilty of contempt of
                    court. Not to mention how he treats his wife, his daughter, his cabinet, and the
                    American people, especially women.</p>
                <pb facs="0887" n="Page0887"/>
                <p>For all of these reasons I was glad that he was impeached by the House of
                    Representatives in early 1999. I also became disillusioned with him because he
                    follows public opinion polls too closely. He was selfish and reckless and
                    immature and put his stupid, mind-boggling gratification above his Presidency,
                    his character, and his family. He is a person who clearly was already in danger
                    because of his relationship with Jennifer Flowers and Paula Jones and all of the
                    rumors of other matters. He didn't even have the sense to do what he was doing
                    outside of the Oval Office.</p>
                <p>I think that people may disagree on whether he should have been removed from
                    office. The biggest argument against his removal is that the American people
                    didn't want it, and therefore there would have been bitterness and polarization
                    on this issue. I can live with impeachment and a finding by a judge that Clinton
                    has been guilty of contempt of court, as well as permanent stains on his record.
                    However, I stand by some of the positive aspects of his record, including some
                    of the things that he accomplished. On balance, I am furious at what he did to
                    the country and how he let down the American people. It was a tremendous waste
                    of talent. And the issue was not “sex” but the breaking of the law and coverups
                    and how he dragged this nation deceitfully for years.</p>
                <p>So those are some comments of mine about the Presidents I served under. Regarding
                    Vice President Al Gore, I knew him only superficially before I entered office
                    under the Clinton administration. In 1992, I chaired a Carnegie National
                    Commission on Foreign Policy, to look at our foreign policy and make suggestions
                    to the incoming Administration. One of the people we talked to before we wrote
                    the document was then Senator Gore. We talked to him about foreign policy, and
                    particularly on the environment, where he has been an expert. At that meeting
                    and in the course of other, superficial observations of him, I was impressed
                    with Gore as a moderate Democrat, a dynamic and experienced figure, basically
                    centrist in his instincts. This view of Gore, which is widely held, was
                    reinforced during the occasions I had to deal with him during the first term of
                    President Clinton. This included dealing with visiting Chinese or other Asian
                    leaders, for example, and substituting for President Clinton, as Vice President
                    Gore did in Osaka in 1995.</p>
                <p>In debates on Vietnam policy I thought that Gore conducted himself well. For
                    example, on Vietnam policy, as I've said, I thought that President Clinton was
                    very skittish because of his own draft evasion and his worry about domestic
                    backlash. Gore was generally supportive of my efforts and those of Secretary of
                    State Christopher to move ahead in a graduated way with normalization of
                    relations with Vietnam, which I thought was in our interest. Gore was very
                    helpful in that regard. So I generally had, and I still have, a basically
                    positive opinion of Vice President Gore. He was extremely hard-working,
                    well-versed, experienced, and, on the whole, a centrist figure. However, I have
                    become less enamored with him because he got up, on the day that President
                    Clinton was impeached, and said that Clinton was one of our greatest Presidents.
                    That was a bit much for me. I realized that he felt that he had to be loyal to
                    the President, but I thought that went too far.</p>
                <pb facs="0888" n="Page0888"/>
                <p>Gore certainly has been a very impressive Vice President. I don't think that any
                    Vice President has been as intimately involved in policy matters. This has not
                    just involved PR [Public Relations] but counseling the President, sitting in on
                    key decisions, and undertaking important assignments abroad and at home. He has
                    handled these matters quite competently. So I have no animus against Vice
                    President Gore. He has certainly treated me decently. At a couple of meetings
                    which I attended, Vice President Gore did seem to be following briefing cards
                    and not knowing the issues very well. However, that was the exception, rather
                    than the rule. Gore is a little stiff, as people say, but I thought that he was
                    a decent man. Again, I'm basically positive toward Gore, but I can't live with
                    his statement that President Clinton was one of our greatest Presidents.</p>
                <p>I was originally a tremendous fan of Mrs. Clinton. I first got to know her,
                    sitting next to her at dinner at the White House, when I had occasion to talk to
                    her for most of a couple of hours. I also met her superficially at various
                    meetings and social occasions. She was always very gracious, warm, and obviously
                    intelligent. I became a super fan of hers when I accompanied her on a week-long
                    trip to China and Mongolia. That this was in the fall of 1995. She went to a
                    United Nations conference on women's rights in Beijing. We attended this
                    conference for several days. It was primarily an international conference, not a
                    U.S.-China meeting. She had no bilateral meetings with Chinese leaders. We were
                    having trouble with the Chinese at that point, but that wasn't the question. She
                    was there for the UN meeting as a representative of the U.S. Then we went on to
                    Mongolia.</p>
                <p>First of all, she confirmed what everyone knows. She is extremely bright and the
                    smartest First Lady that I've ever met. However, beyond that, she took advice I
                    gave her on a speech. I was there essentially as her adviser on China and
                    Mongolia. I was the only person outside her immediate staff. They were very
                    loyal to her and very friendly to me. I encouraged her to be tough with respect
                    on human rights and women's rights, including implied criticism of her
                    hosts.</p>
                <p>Some of the State Department people and other advisers were telling her: “Don't
                    embarrass the President” by beating up on the Chinese record on women's rights
                    or human rights. However, I said: “Absolutely not. You're here to speak at a UN
                    women's conference. You're addressing that issue and you can put it in universal
                    terms and not just China. But you shouldn't shy away from it. That's not
                    inconsistent with engagement with China; it is another dimension of it. You
                    should express your own convictions and principles because of the nature of the
                    conference and to show that we have a balanced policy toward China. We're just
                    not going to roll over for them.” So, if anything, I toughened up her speech.
                    She probably expected me, as the Department of State adviser, to suggest that
                    she not annoy our Chinese clients or to be nice to them. I may have gained her
                    respect in that sense. In my consideration of the issue, I advised her in terms
                    of what I thought was right for U.S. policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0889" n="Page0889"/>
                <p>She took other advice and was modest in her approach. The speech was strong and
                    good and went over very well. She got a tremendous reception on a day when it
                    was pouring rain. I still remember the unbelievably bad conditions under which
                    it was delivered. She spoke in a tent.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Clinton was also very friendly, warm, and approachable. She didn't lose her
                    dignity, and she was still the First Lady of the United States, but you felt
                    that you could talk to her as a human being and a friend. She displayed a good
                    sense of humor. So I just liked her on every level and I retain these positive
                    views of her to this day.</p>
                <p>However, because of the scandal involving President Clinton, I've lost some
                    respect for her. She is too smart not to have known what was going on.
                    Therefore, she was an enabler for the President. She said that this affair
                    involved a “vast right wing conspiracy” and said that right after the Monica
                    Lewinsky scandal broke. She had also protected the President during the campaign
                    on the Jennifer Flowers issue. You can't judge other people's marriage, but,
                    perhaps out of ambition, for a woman who is supposedly a spokesperson for
                    women's rights to put up with this kind of performance by her husband to me is
                    beyond the pale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's turn to your experience with the various Secretaries
                        of State you knew. You've already talked quite a bit about George
                        Shultz...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: I've already talked about Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, and Warren
                    Christopher, the three Secretaries of State I worked with the most. I've
                    discussed Kissinger at great length, as well as Shultz and Christopher. I've
                    already talked about Shultz and I'll just touch on him briefly.</p>
                <p>I think that George Shultz was a truly excellent Secretary of State, one of our
                    three best since World War II, though he is not Dean Acheson or Henry Kissinger
                    in stature. By the way, Kissinger deserves to be ranked as one of our top
                    Secretaries of State and National Security Advisers. I think that it's just a
                    bit misleading to say that Kissinger was a great Secretary of State. You have to
                    include his 5-6 years as National Security Adviser. He was a great Secretary of
                    State, but he was also a great National Security Adviser. You have to put the
                    two positions together because, otherwise, you lose some of his almost
                    incredible achievements during the first four years of the Nixon Administration.
                    I've covered his achievements at the Department of State as well as the NSC. At
                    State in addition to Middle East breakthroughs and independence for Rhodesia
                    (becoming Zimbabwe) and his other specific accomplishments, perhaps Kissinger's
                    greatest contribution was his holding the country and our foreign policy
                    together almost single-handedly in the wake of the Watergate Affair. But you
                    have to add the 1969-1973 achievements, what he did in terms of China, the
                    Soviet Union, Vietnam, and the Middle East, etc. before he became Secretary of
                    State.</p>
                <pb facs="0890" n="Page0890"/>
                <p>Shultz, of course, was brought in after Al Haig's debacle and Haig's quarreling
                    with Jim Baker and the White House staff generally, as well as Haig's general
                    personality. Shultz brought in a steadiness of personality but, much more
                    important than that, on most issues I happen to have agreed with Shultz. I think
                    that he had just the right balance of toughness and a willingness to negotiate
                    with the Soviets and with others. He was out in front on some issues like
                    terrorism and the importance of technology to foreign policy and the world in
                    general. He was way ahead of most people on issues like that. He had patience
                    and toughness of the kind that Warren Christopher had, and I'll get back to
                    Christopher later. Shultz had somewhat greater conceptual strength than
                    Christopher did, though obviously much less than Kissinger.</p>
                <p>Shultz didn't have the most effusive kind of personality. He didn't have a great
                    sense of humor. He was very tough to figure out, not just for me, but for others
                    as well. People used to call him “the Big Buddha.” If you were briefing him for
                    a meeting, he was a terrific listener, and you knew that he was taking in
                    everything that you said. That's the good news. The bad news is that you had no
                    idea how much he agreed. He would listen and absorb what you said and, perhaps,
                    ask a few questions. However, you never got much feedback. You never knew how
                    much he was taking aboard and how much he agreed with. You knew that you were
                    being listened to, carefully. But Shultz handled himself extremely well in
                    meetings, and you could tell that he took aboard your briefing. So it all came
                    out all right, but you never got a sense of feedback, nor was he ever
                    particularly generous in extending praise to his subordinates. That's the least
                    important attribute, but, if you're a human being, you have to get some
                    feedback.</p>
                <p>A couple of times I got some feedback from George Shultz indirectly. For example,
                    in connection with his lengthy trip to China in 1987, I think that I've
                    mentioned what he said on the airplane on the way back to the U.S. He said that
                    this was the single, best trip he had ever taken as Secretary of State, and
                    maybe as a public official. Our Embassy and I had something to do with that. I
                    know that George Shultz thought highly of me, but I could never have proved it
                    by his exchanges, his memoirs, or anything else. He had a Buddha-like quality,
                    but that's the least important characteristic about someone.</p>
                <pb facs="0891" n="Page0891"/>
                <p>When you talk about President Reagan bringing an end to the Cold War, you have to
                    include George Shultz in there as well. I don't think that Reagan could have
                    done it by himself. Reagan was excellent, in the sense of being principled,
                    firm, and steady. With the help of George Shultz and Mrs. Reagan he also saw the
                    need to negotiate. However, essentially, he built up our assets. An additional
                    factor which helped to bring down the Soviet empire was the basic rottenness of
                    the Soviet system. In addition to that it was U.S. spending on defense, and
                    particularly the Star Wars program, calling the Soviet Union an Evil Empire, his
                    insistence on human rights, as well as negotiating with the Soviets and meeting
                    separately with dissidents in Moscow. In supporting all this, Shultz had the
                    basic instincts to conduct a firm policy and exert some leverage on the Soviets.
                    He continued to exert pressure on the Soviets over their invasion of
                    Afghanistan. When I was in China, we did an awful lot of work against the
                    Russians, with the help of the Chinese. Reagan was very good at putting pressure
                    on the Soviets. Shultz could turn those assets and leverage into negotiated
                    outcomes and use them effectively, in a diplomatic sense. So Reagan deserves
                    credit for picking the right man as Secretary of State, that is, George Shultz,
                    after making a mistake with Al Haig.</p>
                <p>I think that you have to give Shultz a lot of the credit for steering President
                    Reagan, in a hard-headed way, toward negotiations with the Soviets and using the
                    leverage that he had built up. I give Shultz a lot of credit for that.</p>
                <p>Shultz was clearly opposed to the Iran-Contra idea of trading arms for hostages.
                    He skated close to flatly denying his involvement in that. He clearly was
                    against it, but it seemed to me that it turned out that he knew that something
                    was going on in this respect. However, he didn't dare try to find out just what
                    it was, which is not the most heroic position to take. He certainly was a lot
                    better, as were Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger, than Lieutenant Colonel
                    Oliver North, Bud McFarland, and the rest of the group on the National Security
                    Council staff. But he could have been more aggressive, and not just passively
                    against the Iran-Contra maneuver. He could have poked around a lot more than he
                    did. So Shultz sort of escaped criticism for that.</p>
                <p>I recall that Shultz agonized over this issue. I could tell from the media and
                    what I had heard that he debated whether he should stay on as Secretary of State
                    after the Iran-Contra debacle. Not because he was involved in it, but just
                    generally because of his unease over the whole matter. I wrote him a personal,
                    back channel message, on November 22, encouraging him to stay on as Secretary of
                    State. I told him how important he was, how steady he was, and that he had
                    invested too much to leave his position. I'm not pretending that this message
                    had much impact on what he decided to do. I just cite it. Obviously, others were
                    telling him the same thing. I don't think that Shultz ever really came close to
                    resigning as Secretary of State, but there were some rumors circulating to that
                    effect. (End of tape)</p>
                <pb facs="0892" n="Page0892"/>
                <p>In 1984, during President Reagan's trip to China, the American business community
                    had a meeting with Secretary of State Shultz. Or maybe it was a separate trip
                    which Secretary of State Shultz made by himself. Anyway, Shultz was in China on
                    this occasion, and the businessmen began criticizing the United States over our
                    maintaining controls on exports and not sharing technology with China. The
                    American business community also complained about other aspects of how the U.S.
                    dealt with China in the economic field. To his credit, Shultz controlled his
                    anger but, in effect, said: “If you don't like the United States, leave it.” He
                    said in substance, support your government. I don't recall his exact words, but
                    in effect he made a very tough reply to the American business community.</p>
                <p>The American business community also attacked Secretary of State Christopher when
                    he went to China. They were more polite, but they still displayed an obnoxious
                    attitude to him. They undercut our policy in China by lobbying us, together with
                    the U.S. economic agencies, and by splitting the U.S. government and thus
                    encouraging the Chinese to be inflexible on human rights, as I discussed earlier
                    in this interview. They never pressed the Chinese. Zhu Rongji has just been in
                    Washington as we speak in the spring of 1999. The American business community is
                    regularly critical of the Administration and the President but fawns all over
                    Zhu. So on the whole, and with some exceptions, the American business community
                    has behaved outrageously on China trade issues, as it has on human rights issues
                    generally. Thus I always respected Secretary Shultz for responding firmly to
                    them on that issue. So I always gave him very high marks, although I couldn't
                    always figure out what he wanted to do. I thought that he was a solid, steady
                    presence. There were considerable achievements made during this period.</p>
                <p>As we sit here in this magnificent Foreign Service Institute [FSI], my
                    understanding is that Shultz was responsible for the rehabilitation of this
                    building for use by the FSI at a time of budget constraints. He realized the
                    need for training our diplomats. He put aside the necessary money for this work
                    and held firmly on this issue. At the time it would have been very easy to say:
                    “Well, we'll do that some other time. I have to worry about nuts and bolts now.
                    That's for next year.” He deserves credit for that as well.</p>
                <p>In terms of style as Secretary he relied heavily on his Assistant Secretaries and
                    the career service rather than a palace guard of close aides (as Baker did). In
                    this respect he was probably the best in using professionals and was popular for
                    that.</p>
                <p>Any more questions on Shultz?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. I thought that you might express whatever thoughts you
                        might have on Secretary of State Jim Baker, even though you did not serve
                        under him.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0893" n="Page0893"/>
                <p>LORD: Well, under Reagan he was Secretary of the Treasury after he was White
                    House Chief of Staff. At the time I was serving as Ambassador to China. The only
                    really direct experience I had with him was when he made a trip to China as
                    Secretary of the Treasury. This must have been some time in 1987. I was very
                    impressed with him. I had heard about his political shrewdness. I had admired
                    his performance as White House Chief of Staff. I knew that he was skillful in
                    getting people elected but also did a terrific job as Chief of Staff to
                    President Reagan. It seemed to me that he was doing a good job as Secretary of
                    the Treasury. I had a favorable impression of him before he came to China, and
                    it was even stronger after he left. I thought that he dealt with the Chinese
                    well. He didn't fawn over them. He was polite but businesslike, which you have
                    to be with the Chinese. Too many people fawn over them, as business people often
                    do, and they are seduced by their Chinese experience.</p>
                <p>A minor issue came up during Secretary of the Treasury Baker's visit to China. I
                    can't remember now what it was, but he skillfully negotiated a concrete solution
                    to the problem while he was there. I think that it involved financial services
                    of some kind. It may have been related to the dual taxation treaty, or something
                    like that. It was not a matter of cosmic importance, but I saw the skill with
                    which Baker handled it. He was very personable. I liked him and was very
                    impressed with him. I always thought that he was an able person. I think that he
                    did a pretty good job on foreign policy during the Bush administration.
                    Certainly, he performed well during the Gulf War and with respect to the German
                    reunification issue.</p>
                <p>But handling relations with China reflected the less laudable side of Secretary
                    Baker. He made sure he stayed away from controversial issues. As a result, he
                    was not obnoxious on China in terms of being soft, as General Brent Scowcroft
                    and Bush had been. He just tried to stay out of current issues on China policy
                    altogether. He just basically let other people deal with the Chinese because he
                    knew that in domestic, political terms, after the Tiananmen Square massacre,
                    China was not a popular issue. So he had a tendency to stay away from something
                    that would hurt him politically. This was not exactly an admirable trait.</p>
                <p>Also Baker really relied on a palace guard at State. They were very able. But the
                    Foreign Service felt excluded and resented this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From my interviews I have the feeling that Baker, in
                        effect, was somewhat interested in running for President. He kept that
                        option open, which is always very dangerous for a Secretary of State. As was
                        the case with Kissinger, a Secretary of State deals with things that most
                        Americans don't want to have to deal with.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0894" n="Page0894"/>
                <p>LORD: That is an issue that I would fault Baker on. The example of China is a
                    good one. There were some others that were controversial that I now forget. He
                    tried to keep a low profile on them. He would be happy to be engaged in the more
                    popular ones. But in terms of dealing with the Russians and German
                    reunification, the Gulf War, and some of the big ticket items, Baker was
                    excellent. The team of Baker, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, National
                    Security Adviser Scowcroft, and President Bush made up a pretty harmonious
                    group, whatever else you may think of them.</p>
                <p>Baker was very skillful. At first, when he entered federal government service, he
                    was one of three people working for President Reagan as co-chief of staff in
                    effect. He shoved the other two aside skillfully. I forget their names now, but
                    Baker became first among equals. Later, he became Secretary of the Treasury for
                    Reagan and then Secretary of State for Bush.</p>
                <p>One footnote here. Baker didn't treat George Shultz, his predecessor as Secretary
                    of State, very well. They were both moderate Republicans, working for Republican
                    administrations and they had been cabinet colleagues. I know that Shultz, who
                    was pretty tight-lipped, was pretty annoyed that Baker wasn't particularly
                    graceful during his transition into office as Secretary of State. As I recall,
                    he consulted Shultz only once, and never called him very much afterwards, so
                    Shultz was somewhat annoyed that his successor as Secretary of State wasn't more
                    gracious.</p>
                <p>You're right. Baker was someone who was always calculating his political image
                    and would stay away from controversial issues. Maybe he was too clever by half,
                    certainly more of a negotiator and tactician than he was a conceptualizer, like
                    Kissinger or Zbigniew Brzezinski. On the whole, I think that Baker did a pretty
                    good job as Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>I naively thought that I had a pretty good reputation with him, too. I obviously
                    can't judge people. Baker didn't invite me to be in the Department of State with
                    him, which sort of surprised me, to be honest. However, I have no particular
                    animus against Baker.</p>
                <p>I think that the fact that he stayed away from some controversial issues suggests
                    that after President Bush's term was over, they were not the closest of friends.
                    In contrast, Scowcroft at first wasn't particularly close to President Bush -
                    certainly not as close as Baker - but he became much closer to him and
                    collaborated with him on the book published by Bush. I think that Bush feels
                    that Baker distanced himself from some of these controversial issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Baker kept his distance from Bush, although they were both
                        from the same city.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: It sounds that way now. They used to be very close friends, and Baker's low
                    profile on some tough issues may be the explanation for this new distance.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then we come to Secretary of State Christopher. I would
                        also like you to talk a bit about former Vice President and then Ambassador
                        to Japan, Fritz Mondale.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: All right. Let me comment on Mondale briefly. I have covered him elsewhere,
                    too. I had known Mondale superficially off and on over the years. He was
                    involved with the Council on Foreign Relations when I was there. I had also met
                    him in some other capacities. My mother was from Minneapolis, so there was
                    always a Minnesota connection to a certain extent, but I didn't know Mondale
                    well. As I say, I knew him superficially as Vice President. I got to know him
                    best when he was Ambassador to Japan, during the Clinton first term as
                    President. I got to like him and, to this day, I'm full of admiration for him.
                    Mondale was always more liberal on domestic politics than I was, as a centrist,
                    but that's not a sin. I always respected him. He is an extremely decent man. He
                    was a perfect example of why a political appointee as Ambassador can be so good.
                    Every Foreign Service officer that I know welcomes good political appointees of
                    good quality, if they deserve it and if they bring new blood into diplomacy. All
                    of this is positive, as long as you don't have too many political appointees,
                    taking all of the best posts.</p>
                <p>Mondale's appointment as Ambassador to Japan was important to show Japan that we
                    had someone of elevated stature for assignment to that post. It was a wise
                    appointment and paid the Japanese tribute. However, more important, Mondale's
                    political instincts turned out to be terrific. I remember when I was briefing
                    him before he went to Tokyo in 1993. I recall his saying that what he intended
                    to do was to be very respectful of the Japanese in public but to be as tough as
                    he had to be in private, particularly on economic and trade issues. Ambassador
                    Armacost had been tough with the Japanese as well. In fact, some of his
                    toughness in private crept into the public dimension, and he was knocked around
                    a little bit by the Japanese because of it. I think that was a bum rap. Armacost
                    was a very close friend and was my deputy at one time. He was terrific and did
                    an excellent job in Tokyo as Ambassador, particularly in the wake of former
                    Senator Mike Mansfield. I yield to no one in my respect and affection for the
                    Senator, but Ambassador Mansfield increasingly suffered from clientitis and was
                    much too soft on the Japanese on economic issues. Ambassador Mansfield was
                    disdained by the American business community. I don't always side with the
                    American business community but I think that they had a point that Mansfield
                    wasn't always tough enough with the Japanese. So Armacost had to correct that
                    impression when he replaced Mansfield.</p>
                <p>I think that Ambassador Mondale combined the best of all worlds. He was very
                    respectful and cordial with the Japanese in public, without fawning over the
                    Japanese. However, he could be very tough with them in private, including on
                    economic issues, even as he worked with us and others, including Secretary of
                    Defense Perry, myself, and Joe Nye to insulate our security relationship with
                    the Japanese from our economic frictions. Mondale proved his worth, not only in
                    terms of his style with the Japanese, but in terms of his political instincts
                    also.</p>
                <p>There was one incident during his tenure as Ambassador to Japan. I don't have
                    this exactly right, but a Japanese student in this country was shot to
                    death.</p>
                <pb facs="0896" n="Page0896"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was during the Halloween period in Louisiana, or some
                        place like that. It was awful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: That's right. Ambassador Mondale didn't ask for instructions or even get on
                    the phone and ask whether he could do this or that. Using his political
                    instincts, he immediately went on Japanese television and apologized on behalf
                    of the United States. Not in a guilt-ridden way that would be excessive, but in
                    an appropriate way. He defused the domestic Japanese backlash immediately by his
                    instinct to get out there quickly in the same news cycle as the report on the
                    murder. This showed that his political instincts were very good.</p>
                <p>Another example was when there was the terrible incident of the rapes in Okinawa.
                    He was magnificent in dealing with the Japanese public on that, as well as
                    privately with Japanese officials.</p>
                <p>So I was very high on Mondale's firmness, his hard work, his balanced view that
                    we had to do something about economic issues, as otherwise they might intrude on
                    security matters; the security relationship is in our own interest, and we have
                    to keep it insulated from economic issues. This takes hard work on the security
                    side. Together with Defense Secretary Perry, Mondale deserves a lot of credit. I
                    think Mondale was an excellent Ambassador and a very decent man. I have great
                    admiration for him.</p>
                <p>Let's discuss some of the other people in the Clinton administration, starting
                    with Secretary of State Warren Christopher. I have great respect for
                    Christopher, who is a very decent person. Everyone knows his public service. He
                    served twice in the Department of State as Deputy Secretary and then as
                    Secretary. He also had responsible positions in California and was Deputy
                    Attorney General of the United States. He dealt with riots during the Vietnam
                    War and police problems in Los Angeles. He's really had a distinguished career.
                    Whether it was dealing with the problem of hostages from the American Embassy in
                    Teheran or police problems in Los Angeles, he's had some genuine
                    accomplishments. I consider Christopher a friend, and he's always been very
                    decent to me.</p>
                <pb facs="0897" n="Page0897"/>
                <p>I believe in being loyal and I will be loyal to Christopher. Having said that, I
                    think that he was too old for the job of Secretary of State. He came into the
                    position at age 70 or 71. Some people are very vigorous at that age, and he is
                    in great shape, physically. He jogs all the time, he's thin as a rail, and he's
                    tough. However, I got tired in my late '50s as Assistant Secretary of State. I
                    don't think that you can be in your 70s and be President or Secretary, although
                    Reagan managed to pull it off. Toward the end with Reagan, it was a close call.
                    There were times when I just felt that Christopher's stamina was amazing for
                    someone of his age and in view of the pressures he was under. But that's the
                    point. A Secretary of State shouldn't have to have amazing stamina. I really
                    don't think that people in their 70s should be President or Secretary of State,
                    no matter how vigorous they are. I just don't think that they can handle the
                    job, as a rule. So I think that he paid a certain price for his age, even
                    though, God knows, he was amazing in his resilience, in recovering from jet lag,
                    and in being tough. There were times when you could tell that he was tired and
                    not at the top of his game. I don't blame him for that. He was a great public
                    servant. At his age he could have rested on his laurels but he was willing to
                    serve his government. But I think that the factor of his age intruded on his
                    effectiveness. Like Shultz, Christopher was very difficult to figure out. He was
                    very much like Shultz in briefings. He would listen, but you had no idea how
                    much he was taking aboard. Having said that, I felt that, like Shultz and
                    perhaps even more so, it was worthwhile to brief him because he was following a
                    lot of your ideas. He would stick very closely to the talking points he was
                    given. He knew his material and worked very hard at it. However, I had the
                    feeling at times that he had a schedule which he had to get through, no matter
                    what, and he didn't have a great deal of spontaneity or time for important
                    detours or follow-up. I wonder whether he could decide whether or not to be
                    discursive or to follow up on something. What you hear about Christopher is
                    true. He was patient, decent, dogged. He had a willingness to take the long view
                    and to hang in there. He was a good negotiator, tactful, and decent. He had all
                    of these qualities. Of course, he had great stamina for his age, but I've
                    already addressed that.</p>
                <p>On Asian matters, I have to say that we didn't do badly when he was Secretary of
                    State. We always had to fight the problem of Eurocentrism. My whole strategy for
                    my confirmation statement and later on was to make Asia as important as Europe
                    in our foreign policy. Looking ahead, I thought that this was as it should be,
                    and in fact it actually was. I had good cooperation from Secretary Christopher
                    on that point. Certainly, Clinton too cooperated on the calendar of the first
                    year of the Clinton presidency, when he started off by going to Japan and Korea,
                    then raising the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] talks to the summit
                    level. Christopher supported that. He made several of his own trips to Asia to
                    visit specific countries and/or to attend economic (APEC and security (ARF)
                    conferences. If I really needed to get his attention on an Asian problem back in
                    Washington, I could do it. I always had direct access to Secretary Christopher
                    and never had any problem with that.</p>
                <pb facs="0898" n="Page0898"/>
                <p>Having said that, I would have to add that problems with Bosnia or the Middle
                    East could distract his attention. That's understandable to a certain extent,
                    but it could be frustrating. There are times when you can only do so much at the
                    Assistant Secretary of State level. I would like to think that I did quite a bit
                    and I surely had access to other leaders, even though the protocol divide was
                    quite extensive. However, at times you have to involve the President or the
                    Secretary of State, and both the President and Christopher at times were
                    distracted by some of these non-Asian matters. We managed to get across to the
                    Asians, and fairly successfully, I think, that we thought that Asia was more
                    important because of the APEC Summit Meetings, because of the regional security
                    dialogues we started, and because of the President's trips to Japan and Korea,
                    his engagement with China and the normalization of relations with Vietnam, etc.
                    For these reasons we managed to elevate the status of Asia within the U.S.
                    Government.</p>
                <p>There were times when the situation was frustrating. On one occasion, as I have
                    related elsewhere, Christopher had to turn around from a regional security
                    meeting somewhere in Southeast Asia, cancel a trip to Australia, and return to
                    the U.S. I recall an anecdote in that connection. The Foreign Minister of
                    Australia, Gareth Evans, was the most impressive foreign minister in the region.
                    He could also be very tart and tough. I had a great relationship with him. He
                    had a great sense of humor and is a brilliant and creative man. However, he was
                    understandably outraged that Secretary Christopher, on this occasion, was
                    canceling his visit to Australia. The meetings were scheduled to last for two
                    days. We were going to go to northern Australia and meet there so that we
                    wouldn't have to go all the way down to Canberra. I was on the phone with Evans,
                    trying to negotiate what the communique would say about why Secretary
                    Christopher had to go back to Washington.</p>
                <p>Evans was screaming in my ear, in effect saying: “You've got to get Christopher
                    to say in the statement that he will visit Australia in the next six months,” or
                    something like that. He must be committed to go to Australia. I ran down the
                    hall to Christopher's office and finally got him to agree to go to Australia. In
                    fact, Evans beat up on me by characteristically using an Australian expression:
                    “You've given me a shit sandwich to deal with my own public opinion and my
                    leaders back home.”I mention all that because a couple of months later I was
                    calling on Evans in New York at the time of the UN General Assembly meeting. It
                    was a one on one meeting, although we also had some advisers present with us. I
                    had access to these foreign ministers. Evans greeted me. There was a little
                    plate of finger sandwiches on the table. So I sat down at the table and moved
                    the sandwiches around, looking at each one of them. Evans noticed this and said:
                    “What the hell are you doing, Lord?” I said: “I'm looking for the shit
                    sandwich!”</p>
                <pb facs="0899" n="Page0899"/>
                <p>In any event, there were some distractions, but on the whole Secretary
                    Christopher helped us on Asia. I say this against his background of great
                    decency and humanity. I like Christopher. However, he is stiff and is basically
                    shy. To me some of the most impressive foreign ministers he dealt with were the
                    ones he liked least, because they were full of themselves and, like Evans, were
                    very blunt and egotistical. However, I thought that Evans was so creative and so
                    friendly to the U.S. on the whole that he was one of the ministers that I liked.
                    Secretary Christopher did not have good chemistry with some of these
                    ministers.</p>
                <p>One issue that Secretary Christopher was very helpful on was Vietnam. I've
                    mentioned elsewhere how we had to fight the White House, because of the
                    skittishness of President Clinton and National Security Adviser Tony Lake on
                    this issue in moving ahead on normalization of diplomatic relations with the
                    Socialist Republic of Vietnam. I went to Christopher and got his support to back
                    up our reports of Vietnamese cooperation on MIAs [Missing in Action] and the
                    interest we had in moving ahead on normalization. He would argue with President
                    Clinton and Tony Lake that we should continue to move ahead. Secretary
                    Christopher was always a very solid factor and deserves a lot of the credit, and
                    I think that I also do, frankly, for our normalization of relations with
                    Vietnam. Secretary Christopher clearly didn't have as much conceptual strength
                    as Secretary Kissinger did. However, who the hell does? Christopher approached
                    negotiations on foreign policy more like a lawyer on discrete issues which you
                    try to solve pragmatically, one at a time, without enunciating great, strategic
                    concepts. You could argue that, in the wake of the Cold War, that was
                    appropriate. However, Christopher didn't have the developed sense of grand
                    strategy that Kissinger had.</p>
                <p>I think that Christopher came out looking fairly good as a Secretary of State. He
                    won't be ranked with the great Secretaries. Part of that is due to the
                    opportunities which some of them had, such as Secretary Acheson did. Part of it
                    is how good the Secretary is. If his record had been written after his first two
                    years as Secretary of State, Christopher would have looked worse than he does as
                    a whole. That is true of President Clinton's first two years as well.</p>
                <p>One of Christopher's big mistakes, as he freely admits, is that he went to Europe
                    to discuss policy toward Bosnia and backed off from being tough with the
                    Yugoslavs, because of European skittishness, as opposed to showing leadership.
                    There were problems in Somalia, and some of them were due to President Clinton.
                    There were initial problems in Haiti, although that ended up coming out pretty
                    well. There was a tough trip we made to China in March, 1994, which we have
                    talked about. Certainly, President Clinton didn't back up Christopher on China
                    policy. So the first couple of years of the first Clinton administration were
                    pretty tough for Christopher. He had a pretty bad press.</p>
                <pb facs="0900" n="Page0900"/>
                <p>The press is never as kind when things go well as it is vicious when things don't
                    go well. I think that by the time Christopher left office, the press gave him a
                    much better scorecard than he would have gotten for his first two years in
                    office as Secretary of State, but I think that he deserves better than that. His
                    patience and plodding paid off with some progress in the Middle East. We finally
                    got the Dayton Accord on Yugoslavia. Of course, Assistant Secretary Dick
                    Holbrooke had a lot to do with that. One could question now whether we should
                    have dealt with Milosevic. However, the Dayton Accord stopped the killing in
                    Bosnia for three years, if nothing else. Holbrooke himself said that Christopher
                    was very helpful on that front.I've indicated that Christopher was helpful on
                    Vietnam and policies toward some other Asian countries which we have discussed.
                    I'm not trying to recall everything that Christopher did. I know that he worked
                    very hard with the Chinese, despite the problems, to get us out of the hole that
                    we were in following the Taiwan missile crises. In 1996 he met several more
                    times with Qian Qichen, his counterpart. Even as Tony Lake was getting more
                    involved, you have to give Christopher a lot of the credit, after some rough
                    times with the Chinese, for helping to restore that relationship. He held
                    strategy meetings on how we could get through this difficult period in the
                    spring of 1996, and he helped to implement this strategy. He stayed in touch by
                    correspondence and by meetings with Qian. He ended up with a successful trip to
                    China in November, 1996, where we fixed the summit meetings with the Chinese,
                    which was announced a few days later in Manila at the APEC summit meeting.</p>
                <p>Christopher also worked hard with the Japanese Foreign Ministers, who kept
                    changing to try to make sure that our economic frictions did not spread to the
                    overall relationship, including security ties and a common agenda on global
                    issues and so on. So Christopher worked quite hard on the Japan front. He also
                    was very involved and supportive of our policy on Korea.</p>
                <p>I think that, by the time he was through as Secretary of State, the Clinton
                    foreign policy looked better, and Christopher also looked better. I think that
                    he will go down, and rightly, as a solid and competent Secretary of State,
                    though not a great Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coming from the White House, where you had served
                        previously, did you get the impression this was one of those things that
                        happens from time to time? When things weren't going too well, such as the
                        situation in Somalia, and it looked as if Haiti was going badly, there were
                        those on the domestic side of the White House staff who sort of bad mouthed
                        Christopher.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0901" n="Page0901"/>
                <p>LORD: I wouldn't say that this was systematic. The back biting and bad mouthing
                    was not as bad as I've seen in other administrations. Although I was never that
                    close to Secretary Christopher, it was clear that there were some tensions
                    developing with National Security Adviser Tony Lake. This was the situation,
                    even though both Christopher and Lake had sworn to avoid a repetition of the
                    Brzezinski-Vance era, where there were significant tensions between the White
                    House and the State Department, and the Kissinger-Rogers era, when there were
                    similar problems. Lake was getting somewhat secretive. Occasionally, it looked
                    as if Lake was trying to cut Christopher out, to a certain extent. Christopher
                    always had a good relationship with Defense Secretary Perry, so his problem was
                    manageable.</p>
                <p>To be honest about it, I don't recall too many reports coming out of the White
                    House knocking Christopher. But during the March, 1994, trip to China, as I have
                    said, there was a noticeable lack of support for Christopher. I'm sure that
                    there was some effort by the spinmeisters [White House staff members who sought
                    to put their own spin on events] to make sure that, if President Clinton was
                    having trouble on foreign policy - e.g., on China in March 1994 - this could be
                    attributed to Secretary Christopher and away from the President. I don't think
                    that it was any accident. Christopher took a lot of the heat for some of the
                    Clinton administration's early stumbles on foreign policy, when it was really a
                    distracted President Clinton who had something to do with this as well. But many
                    White House staffs do this to Cabinet members.</p>
                <p>One last anecdote of a personal nature with Christopher. It shows a little bit
                    how he was tough to figure out. His first Deputy Secretary of State was Cliff
                    Wharton. He was a very decent and able man in many ways but not a good fit to be
                    Deputy Secretary of State. He just wasn't working out in the job. It was clear
                    by the end of the first year that this wasn't working out and that Wharton
                    really wasn't helping Christopher very much as Deputy Secretary of State.
                    Christopher had actually wanted somebody else as Deputy Secretary. I can't
                    remember whether it was Thomas Pickering or who it was. However, the White
                    House, to make the cabinet have more of the ethnic variety of the United States
                    as a whole, wanted to have an African-American as Deputy Secretary of State.
                    Wharton had a distinguished career and is a great guy but he just wasn't fit for
                    that job. So Christopher was looking for a new Deputy Secretary of State.</p>
                <pb facs="0902" n="Page0902"/>
                <p>In any event, to make a long story short, and this happened in the
                    November-December, 1993, period, the list of alternative Deputy Secretaries kept
                    narrowing. I had heard, although indirectly, as no one actually told me in so
                    many words, that I was on the list of possible appointees to be Deputy Secretary
                    of State. Then on a weekend, which must have been early in December, 1993, Peter
                    Tarnoff, Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs, asked me into his
                    office. I don't recall if this was for some other reason, but he asked me to
                    come up. Peter Tarnoff is very close to Christopher. He told me: “I want you to
                    know that Christopher has now narrowed down the choices for Deputy Secretary of
                    State to yourself and Strobe Talbott. He'll probably make up his mind this
                    weekend between the two of you.” This was interesting news. I had heard that I
                    was one of the candidates, but this was more specific information and was
                    clearly a concrete indication of where we stood. Tarnoff wasn't laying odds on
                    either Talbott or me.</p>
                <p>I don't recall the sequence, but I got a phone call, and I think that it was
                    after this conversation with Tarnoff, but certainly before that weekend, from
                    Elaine Scolino of the New York Times. She said that she was writing a front page
                    story that Winston Lord had been chosen to be Deputy Secretary of State. I said:
                    “If that's true, you know something that I don't know. You'd better check that
                    out before you finish this story. It doesn't sound right to me. No one has told
                    me that.” She checked the story out and found out further and learned that it
                    wasn't true. I think that at that point the choice had not been made. Anyway, I
                    received this phone call reportedly anointing me as Deputy Secretary of
                    State.</p>
                <p>I got home that weekend after the conversation with Peter Tarnoff, figuring that
                    Christopher was going to make up his mind on this appointment. People may not
                    believe this, but I was relaxed about this choice, either way. Of course, I
                    wanted the honor and challenge of being Deputy Secretary of State, but I really
                    liked doing what I did. In some ways, as the Assistant Secretary of State in a
                    regional bureau, you can do a lot more than doing a lot of grubby work as Deputy
                    Secretary. So in terms of protocol, ego, and in historical and resume terms, it
                    would have been great if I had been appointed Deputy Secretary. However, also,
                    due to the pressures that would be on me as Deputy Secretary, as well as other
                    considerations, I wasn't panting to be Deputy Secretary. I felt that I would be
                    happy either way. So I wasn't on pins and needles in that sense. But human
                    nature being what it is, when you are one of two finalists for a sub-cabinet job
                    like that, this made for an interesting weekend.</p>
                <pb facs="0903" n="Page0903"/>
                <p>To get back to the point about Christopher's rather puzzling personality, I am
                    sure that Christopher knew, through Peter Tarnoff, that I knew that he was
                    trying to choose between me and Talbott. He also knew that I knew that he was
                    about to make a decision, probably during that weekend. So I was sitting at
                    home, in December, 1993. It was a Sunday evening at about 6:00 PM. The phone
                    rang, and it was the Operations Center at the State Department. They told me
                    that Secretary Christopher would like to speak to me. I made a mental note for
                    my memoirs that I had been offered the job of Deputy Secretary of State at 6:00
                    PM that day. This must be the purpose of his call, because he almost never
                    bothered his colleagues on weekends unless there were a crisis.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Christopher got on the phone, and he asked me about some news report on
                    something that had happened in China. I think that it had to do with a dissident
                    or something like that. It was a little strange, and a funny way to start, given
                    who we were, the context, and so forth. I told him what I knew of the report,
                    and I recommended how I thought we should handle it and what our reaction should
                    be to any questions from the press. Then he said: “Thank you very much,” and
                    hung up the phone.</p>
                <p>I was flabbergasted, primarily because Christopher never called on the weekend.
                    He is such a decent guy that Christopher would only call you on the weekend if
                    there was a crisis. In this sense he is unlike Kissinger, who seems to go out of
                    his way to call you on the weekend if he possibly can. Before this episode,
                    Christopher had almost never called me during a weekend. I found it amazing that
                    he called me at home, when he knew that I knew that I was down to the wire on
                    this choice of possibly being appointed Deputy Secretary of State. The report
                    about an incident in China was not urgent. It could easily have waited until the
                    next morning. There was no reason for him to call me on a Sunday evening.
                    Nevertheless, he called me on a relatively inconsequential matter and then hung
                    up. I like Christopher, but it was almost cruel and unusual punishment in a way.
                    He didn't know that I was relaxed about this issue. He must have figured that I
                    would like to have the job and was very anxious and knew that he was down to two
                    candidates for the position.</p>
                <p>Actually, he didn't make his choice that weekend. It was a week or two later. In
                    fact, it was actually during the Christmas holidays that he made his choice. It
                    must have been in late December, because I was skiing with my son. I'm strange
                    enough that I almost didn't want to get the job because it would interrupt my
                    skiing vacation. When I was skiing with my son in Vail, Colorado, I received a
                    call from Christopher, who said: “I want you to know, before it's announced,
                    that I've chosen Strobe Talbott as my Deputy. I think very highly of you.” He
                    never said that I was the other candidate in the running and had almost been
                    appointed to the job. He knew that I knew this. So that was a very gracious
                    gesture on his part. I said that he had made a very good choice. I wasn't just
                    being polite. I called Strobe Talbott and congratulated him.</p>
                <pb facs="0904" n="Page0904"/>
                <p>Clearly, I had a much more impressive resume than Strobe Talbott had, in the
                    sense of strict foreign policy experience and given everything that I had done,
                    both in and outside of government service. Strobe Talbott had never served in
                    the government, except during the Clinton administration, and then only for a
                    year. However, it's a tribute to him that he had done so well in such a brief
                    period of time in government in managing the relationship with the Soviet Union
                    generally. At that point he was sort of a Special Assistant to Secretary
                    Christopher for Soviet affairs. He had so impressed Christopher by the way he
                    had handled that. Plus, let's face it, and I think it's a very valid reason, he
                    had a very close relationship with President Clinton.</p>
                <p>So Secretary Christopher decided to choose him as Deputy Secretary of State.
                    Plus, I honestly thought that Christopher considered that I was doing a very
                    good job handling Asian affairs and therefore, he wanted me to continue to
                    handle those matters. I think that Christopher made the right choice in Strobe
                    Talbott. I'm not being falsely modest. I had great respect for Talbott. What I
                    respected above all was his ability to be loyal to Christopher and loyal to
                    President Clinton at the same time. He never used his access to the President in
                    any way to exercise leverage on Secretary Christopher. Just the opposite. He was
                    always in Christopher's corner. He was loyal to President Clinton, but he was
                    above all Christopher's deputy. If he could be helpful with the President at
                    Christopher's behest, go over and talk to him, so much the better.</p>
                <p>Talbott was absolutely meticulous and one of the most decent, public servants
                    that I ever met. Also, he was one of the most articulate, and it was a joy to
                    travel with him. He really took briefings seriously and conceptually. He would
                    join in kicking around ideas, make suggestions, be articulate, and use his
                    talking points but vary from them as necessary. He would invite me or others in
                    the group to join in his meetings and make our own points and not just let him
                    dominate it. Then, afterwards, he would have an immediate post mortem to decide
                    what went right, what went wrong, what could have been done better, where we
                    should go from there, and what the outcome would be. It was a joy to write a
                    trip report for him because he was so articulate himself. You could write
                    something really colorful. Secretary Christopher would always take out the best
                    lines, whereas Strobe Talbott would revel in them.</p>
                <p>I have great respect for Strobe Talbott. I mention this incident which is
                    interesting in and of itself, and also because it shows that Christopher was a
                    very decent guy but very hard to figure out. I have kept up good relations with
                    Christopher since then. I've helped him on his book on the Asian part of his
                    service as Secretary of State, his memoirs which have already been published. I
                    continue to have great respect for him.</p>
                <p>I have less to say about some of the others, but a couple of them...</p>

                </p>
                <p>LORD: I think that Bill Perry was certainly one of the most impressive people in
                    the first term of the Clinton administration. I think that Mickey Kantor [U.S.
                    Trade Representative and then Secretary of Commerce] was also impressive. He had
                    a down side in terms of hurting us in some of our relationships, but he got an
                    awful lot done in international trade negotiations. In connection with the APEC
                    [Asia Pacific Economic Conference] summit meeting he was helpful, as well as
                    with the Uruguay Round of GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] and
                    NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement], in addition to some bilateral
                    talks. His deputy, Charlene Barshevsky, was also Kantor's successor as U.S.
                    Trade Representative. She was equally impressive. Obviously, Bob Rubin and Larry
                    Summers [Secretary of the Treasury and Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and
                    eventually Secretary of the Treasury] were impressive on the economic side,
                    given our economic performance and the respect they commanded. However, Bill
                    Perry was up there as one of the most impressive and most decent people in the
                    Clinton administration. He was an excellent Secretary of Defense and a man of
                    great integrity.</p>
                <p>Traveling with Perry, as I did on his trip to China, I found, as was the case
                    with Strobe Talbott, that he was a joy to work with. He would sit around
                    informally and prepare for a meeting carefully, discuss objectively strategy as
                    well as tactics and how we should approach the issues involved. He would invite
                    me to speak with his interlocutors while I was sitting there with him. I was
                    with him during his meetings with the Japanese and the South Koreans, as well as
                    with the Chinese. He would handle himself extremely well and do the post mortems
                    afterwards. He and Strobe Talbott were the best people to travel with because
                    they were terrific in this respect. You didn't get that feedback or intellectual
                    exchange from Secretary Christopher, who was more “Buddha-like,” or from
                    Secretary George Shultz.</p>
                <p>In my view, Perry was right on the issues. He was tough-minded and firm, as a
                    Secretary of Defense should be expected to be. He was also flexible. He saw the
                    value of the Agreed Framework with the North Koreans, even though it wasn't a
                    perfect agreement. He saw the extremes of either acquiescence with the North
                    Korean nuclear program or perhaps going to war. These were less good
                    alternatives than the one he came up with. Secretary of Defense Perry was also
                    helpful on China, helping us develop a military relationship. He not only went
                    to China himself, and I accompanied him, he had his top deputies go with him to
                    develop the exchanges with the Chinese military, generally recognizing the
                    strategic importance of China. However, he could be firm with the Chinese as
                    well. He was a major force, though the decision reflected a unanimous collective
                    opinion, in moving the U.S. Navy aircraft carriers near the Taiwan Straits
                    during the March, 1996, missile crisis affecting Taiwan and China. He felt that
                    this would get the attention of the Chinese leadership, so he proved that he
                    could be very tough, too.</p>
                <pb facs="0906" n="Page0906"/>
                <p>Above all, I think that his greatest accomplishment, at least in the area I was
                    involved in, was Japan. We had a lot of points of friction with Japan on
                    economic issues. He wanted to insulate those problems from our security
                    relationship. I worked hard with Joe Nye, with Secretary of Defense Bill Perry,
                    and with others to do that. There was no question that the Pentagon took the
                    lead on this issue, as it should have done. They handled this matter very well.
                    Perry also handled very well the aftermath of the Okinawa rape incident. He
                    displayed his sensitivity, going ahead with reviewing our defense relationship
                    and guidelines with the Japanese. He helped in his own trip in March 1996 to set
                    up a very successful trip to Japan by President Clinton in April, 1996, during
                    which we reaffirmed our strategic partnership, if that's the word we used, and I
                    think that it was. We did so along broader lines, as well as managing the
                    Okinawa rape crisis and relocating and consolidating our defense facilities in
                    Okinawa to defuse that tension politically and maintain our force presence in
                    Japan. He performed magnificently on all of these fronts. Now, of course, he is
                    heading a review of the role of our Korea policy, and he has the kind of
                    credibility with Congress and domestic public opinion to do that in a very
                    effective way.</p>
                <p>Tony Lake was one of the most puzzling people in the Clinton administration. I
                    had known Tony, of course, first when he was on the staff of Henry Kissinger as
                    National Security Adviser. He had resigned, ostensibly over the Cambodian
                    incursion in 1970, but he was already intending to leave anyway from that
                    position, as I mentioned earlier. I certainly respect his principled objection
                    to the Cambodian incursion. I objected to the Cambodian incursion, too, although
                    I didn't resign, for reasons I've stated. I found Tony a little aloof during the
                    first three years of the first Clinton term. He didn't get much involved in Asia
                    policy. Lake's deputy, Sandy Berger, handled that. Lake seemed much more
                    interested in Bosnia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. He didn't pay much
                    attention to Asia. As I said, he seemed at times to be playing games with
                    Secretary of State Christopher. He was very secretive. He clearly defined his
                    job as staying close to President Clinton and advising him, traveling with him,
                    making sure that he was briefed, and otherwise taking care of the President.
                    Meanwhile, he had Sandy Berger run the NSC [National Security Council] system on
                    a day to day basis. You can argue that that's the way to do it, in the sense
                    that Brent Scowcroft and Bob Gates [former National Security Adviser and his
                    deputy] did, or Colin Powell did, for a time.That's one way to do it. However,
                    Sandy Berger was overloaded with responsibilities and had too much to do. I
                    think that Lake worked very hard, but he didn't seem that much engaged in Asia.
                    He certainly was cautious on the normalization of diplomatic relationships with
                    Vietnam. He had his own hangups from his Vietnam experience, whether or not he
                    was protecting the President or reflecting his own views or feared a backlash in
                    this country or protecting the President's domestic right flank. I just never
                    figured out what he was up to, especially he generally was “liberal,” but he was
                    very unhelpful, on the whole, on Vietnam, except that he kept up a good
                    relationship with some of the families of MIA [Missing in Action] and military
                    personnel. Not only I, but everyone else I have spoken to regarding Lake, found
                    him a puzzling and secretive person to deal with. We couldn't quite understand
                    where he was coming from on some issues and procedures.</p>
                <pb facs="0907" n="Page0907"/>
                <p>Having said that, I would have to say that Lake was very helpful on Asia policy
                    during the last year of the first Clinton term. Specifically on China, Lake
                    became more involved. This was something that Secretary Christopher didn't mind,
                    although he tried for a long time to prevent a trip to China by Lake.
                    Christopher probably didn't want a repeat of Brzezinski's [National Security
                    Adviser during the Carter administration] taking over China policy from Vance.
                    But in 1996 they acted as a tag team, exchanging roles with one another. In
                    1996, Christopher worked very hard on China policy, and so did Lake.</p>
                <p>I joined Lake in strategic discussions with the Chinese in the spring of 1996 at
                    Middleburg, Virginia, at the Harriman estate. He handled himself very well, and
                    we worked closely together. In July, 1996, I went with him to China, where we
                    had important, strategic exchanges and really began to get into substantive
                    discussions with the Chinese, which we should have done a long time previously,
                    on some of the big issues around the world. We were also tough with the Chinese
                    where we had to be. Essentially, we broke the ground for a summit meeting, which
                    Secretary Christopher cemented in November, 1996, during his trip to China.</p>
                <p>Lake was also helpful on Korea. He met with the Koreans and helped to come up
                    with the four party peace proposal, which President Clinton and President Kim
                    Dae Jung announced. I forget the year, but I think that it was during the summer
                    of 1996.</p>
                <p>So, when he finally got himself involved on Asia policy, Lake was very good and
                    very helpful. However, he took a while to do that, and he had these personality
                    quirks which none of us ever figured out.</p>
                <p>Sandy Berger, who was Lake's deputy as National Security Adviser, was one of the
                    hardest working people I have ever met. I think that he was overloaded with
                    responsibility. He was a very decent man, open to all opinions. He felt, as any
                    Deputy NSC Adviser should do, all agency views must get fair consideration. He
                    ran meetings well and with impeccable fairness to all points of view. With my
                    encouragement, after the change in our MFN [Most Favored Nation] policy toward
                    China, we began to have Berger chair meetings on China, as opposed to me.</p>
                <pb facs="0908" n="Page0908"/>
                <p>We worked very closely together. I would go to all of these meetings, but unlike
                    what Jim Mann suggests in his book, this was not a case of the White House
                    taking something away from the State Department after a failed policy. Rather it
                    was recognition of the fact that we had to have more White House attention
                    devoted to China. We had to balance off competing government interests and get
                    discipline among the economic agencies which undercut us in terms of MFN policy
                    and generally have a more integrated China policy. We wanted to have everyone
                    singing from the same sheet of music, and this is not something I could do out
                    of the State Department. Moreover, more NSC leadership meant more Presidential
                    and White House attention. We had to go to the White House and at Berger's
                    level. We were much more successful once we did that, with my full
                    encouragement. I was fully involved in every meeting. I went on every trip,
                    including trips with Tony Lake. So I had no complaints, and this is a typical
                    case of distortion by Jim Mann. This allowed the strategy for 1996, which had
                    come from Secretary Christopher, to be implemented at White House meetings. I
                    think that Sandy Berger was very fair and very good. I had great admiration for
                    him. I thought that he was overwhelmed at times. I think that we can stop here,
                    unless you have some questions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This may be somewhat out of sequence, and we could put it
                        at the end. Here you were, dealing with Asian affairs and particularly
                        Chinese matters. Your wife was born in China. I imagine that your nerve
                        endings would be particularly sensitive to this, but did you find that in
                        the political outlook of many Republicans, and we're talking about 1999, you
                        encountered an almost anti-Chinese, racist bias, as there has been, for
                        example, against the Blacks or Jews or other minority groups?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LORD: The quick answer to your question is “No.” I don't think that there is a
                    racial dimension, certainly in the Republican or Democratic Party as a whole.
                    There may be something of a more general, racist dimension in the American body
                    politic as a whole.</p>
                <pb facs="0909" n="Page0909"/>
                <p>Let me just address this matter briefly. As we speak, there may be a tendency in
                    certain quarters, although I don't know how much evidence there is of this
                    tendency as yet, that, because of indications of official Chinese fund raising
                    and espionage in the U.S. by Asian looking people, there may be some feeling of
                    suspicion toward them. Unfortunately, most Americans can't tell a Chinese from a
                    Japanese or a Korean. I don't think that such a view is very widespread, and I
                    don't even have any proof that it exists. There may be some Chinese-Americans
                    who have a different view of this. They may feel that some Americans have
                    inherent suspicions of Asians, just as some police officers may have inherent
                    suspicions of Blacks or Puerto Ricans they meet on the streets. I don't believe
                    that this has become a major factor as yet among the American public in general.
                    It certainly is not true of Republicans (or Democrats) as a whole.First of all,
                    the reaction to indications of official Chinese fund raising and spying isn't
                    just a Republican matter. A lot of it is, for obvious reasons, but there has
                    also been fund raising on behalf of the Democratic Party. It is also true that
                    some recent cases of spying have taken place during Democratic Party
                    administrations. There are a lot of Democrats who are concerned about some
                    Chinese activities. That includes the Cox Committee Report, which is due to be
                    issued soon and parts of which have already leaked out. This report expresses
                    virtually unanimous views on Chinese spying, from both Democrats as well as
                    Republicans. Certainly, the Republican Party is not unified on China or on this
                    particular aspect of China.</p>
                <p>The views of China as we speak, in the spring of 1999, are not a matter of
                    controversy between Republicans and Democrats. The debates on China are held
                    within the two parties. On the Democratic side, you have great concerns about
                    China in the views of Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi [Democrat, California], union
                    leaders, and some liberal Democrats, primarily because of human rights issues,
                    but also on nuclear non-proliferation and maybe trade deficit issues, and jobs
                    in the case of trade unions. They want a tough posture toward the Chinese. On
                    the other hand there is the Clinton administration and many Democrats who favor
                    engagement with China.</p>
                <p>Similarly, as far as the Republican Party is concerned, there is a debate within
                    the party with respect to policy and attitudes toward China. One of the
                    Republican groups involved in this debate is led by people like Kissinger, Ford,
                    and Scowcroft. These are people who, in the past, have worked for engagement
                    with China and still believe, for geopolitical or other reasons, that we should
                    move more closely to China. Plus businessmen who, on the whole, are Republicans
                    and very much in support of engagement with China. On the other hand there are
                    conservative Republican figures, such as Pat Buchanan or people concerned about
                    the pro-life issue, such as Gary Bauer, or religious people worried about
                    religious discrimination in China, or human rights advocates in general. These
                    people are also worried about our trade deficit with China or about nuclear
                    non-proliferation. And these people, including some in think tanks, see China as
                    a looming military threat. Some consider that China will inevitably be an enemy,
                    and that we should contain that growing power.</p>
                <pb facs="0910" n="Page0910"/>
                <p>So, getting back to your question, I don't think that it's a matter of the
                    Republican Party being racist on China. In the first place, the people most
                    critical of China are within both parties in this debate. And those friendlier
                    to China are within both parties, too. Also, I don't think that those who are
                    against China do so for racist reasons. Sometimes, it's hard to figure out what
                    is implicit racism, but I really think that those who are anti-Chinese,
                    including those in the Republican Party, hold these views for reasons that are
                    understandable and have nothing to do with race. I think that they honestly
                    believe that the Chinese have behaved in a reprehensible way on human rights, on
                    Tibet, and on religious persecution. These people believe that the Chinese have
                    a huge surplus in their trade with the U.S. because they keep their domestic
                    market closed to us. They also believe that the Chinese have been exporting
                    technology, nuclear weapons, and missiles to sensitive areas and rogue regimes,
                    that they are trying to bully Taiwan, and that they are getting arrogant. And
                    many believe that China is becoming a military threat.</p>
                <p>On top of that, the Chinese have been spying against the United States. Some
                    aren't particularly shocked at this, because everyone, including Israel, engages
                    in this kind of activity. But these people consider that this kind of activity
                    is additional evidence of unfriendliness toward the United States. Others feel
                    that the Chinese have tried to influence our political campaigns, although
                    definitive proof is not yet available. Some of these people emphasize some
                    issues more than others. Some of them look at the situation across the board.
                    Plus, there is the matter of China's growing power, and some people believe that
                    China is going to challenge us in the future, not only in Asia but around the
                    world as well. They genuinely want to see a tougher policy pursued toward China,
                    and it's not because the Chinese happen to have yellow skins.</p>
                <p>Now there is no question that some of these people get upset at some things the
                    Chinese do but don't get upset if other people do the same thing. I mean, bad as
                    the Chinese are in the field of human rights, Saudi Arabia, for example, does
                    not exactly have a good record in terms of human rights. Just take the treatment
                    of women. There are other bad regimes which we beat up on, like Iran, Iraq,
                    North Korea, or Serbia under Milosevic. We tend to pick on smaller nations. We
                    beat up on other countries in the field of human rights. Obviously, Israel has
                    advantages because it has tremendous, political clout in this country with
                    Congress and public opinion. People have to worry about the Jewish vote, and so
                    on, much more than they have to worry about the Chinese vote. Israel is also a
                    democracy, and it has some genuine, security concerns. So Israel gets a much
                    easier ride than China, which is not a democracy. On the other hand, some nasty
                    regimes get much tougher treatment from us than China, with whom we have a
                    greater range of interests.</p>
                <p>That's a long-winded way of saying that I ascribe no feelings of real racism in
                    these anti-China tendencies, because I think that it is made up of all these
                    other elements.</p>

                <p>Let me go back briefly to the end of my tenure as Assistant Secretary, after the
                    APEC summit meeting in November 1996.</p>
                <p>In addition to ongoing business, I and my bureau worked hard for the transition
                    to a new Secretary, Madeleine Albright, and my successor, Stanley Roth. This
                    included the preparation of many briefing papers and memoranda, as well as
                    verbal briefings and meetings. There was one particularly important,
                    comprehensive session that I had on the region with Ms. Albright and her top
                    aides.</p>
                <p>I also sent messages and farewell cables to our overseas posts, summing up our
                    years and thanking my colleagues. I also worked on helping the career moves and
                    next assignments of several in my bureau and abroad.</p>
                <p>There were various farewell parties, including a large one with staff,
                    colleagues, and friends (including my wife) at which Secretary Christopher spoke
                    in positive terms.</p>
                <p>Incoming Secretary Albright asked, indeed urged, me to stay on as Assistant
                    Secretary. I declined for reasons cited earlier in this history, including my
                    view that we had made major progress in the region and that our relations with
                    key countries and institutions were in good shape. Also I was tired after four
                    years of the most demanding, along with the Kissinger years, of all my jobs.</p>
                <p>Ms. Albright then offered me my pick of any embassy in the EAP region (and I
                    inferred that other regions might be possible, too). Sandy Berger, the National
                    Security Advisor, clearly with her concurrence, called me to offer specifically
                    the Ambassadorship in Seoul, Korea. I again declined with appreciation. Finally
                    the State Department recommended me to the White House as Ambassador to Japan,
                    the one post I would consider. The White House, however, settled on House
                    Speaker Tom Foley.</p>
                <p>On January 20, 1997 I left government service for almost certainly the last time.
                    I had served in a series of challenging, often dramatic, assignments at the
                    State Department, in Geneva, at the Pentagon, in the White House, again at
                    State, at the Council on Foreign Relations, in China, again in the private
                    sector, and once more at State.</p>

                <p>LORD: Let me say for the record on this afternoon of September 17, 1999, that I
                    want to thank you, Stu Kennedy, for your patience and good questions. My
                    gratitude to you and the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training for
