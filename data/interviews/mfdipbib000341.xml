                <p>AMBASSADOR ROBERT F. ELLSWORTH</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: June 4, 1991</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>This is an interview with Ambassador Robert F. Ellsworth to be done on behalf of
                    the Association for Diplomatic Studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, I wonder if you could give me a bit about
                        your background, where you were educated, and any interest or studies you
                        had in foreign affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: Yes, I really didn't have any studies in foreign affairs. I was
                    educated as an engineer at the University of Kansas, and as a lawyer at the
                    University of Michigan Law School. But I certainly got interested in foreign
                    affairs in World War II and then again in the Korean conflict; in both those
                    conflicts I was a volunteer in the Navy. In World War II I ended up serving—
                    after the war was technically over—in minesweepers in the Pacific cleaning up,
                    interestingly, our own magnetic mines from our own B- 29s off the coast of
                    China. And then in the Korean conflict I ended up for the most part in the
                    Atlantic fleet and specifically in the Sixth Fleet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: In the Mediterranean, so all of that gave me quite a lively interest
                    in foreign affairs, and especially in peace, is the background. It seemed to
                    me—I was just a kid—that it was a terrible shame that we'd gotten into this war;
                    as kids often do feel that way. But I really did feel that way, and I felt that
                    if, in the future, I should have an opportunity to do something about avoiding
                    wars, and resolving conflicts, that I would do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served in Congress from 1961 to 1967?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What district, and what state?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: First the Second District, then the Third District of Kansas because
                    the districts were redrawn after the 1960 census. It was east central Kansas. It
                    included the Kansas City, Kansas, area; it included the residential Gold Coast
                    of the whole Kansas City metropolitan area—that is Johnson County, Kansas. It
                    included the University of Kansas at Lawrence, and it included, if you will,
                    what they called the milk shed of the Kansas City metropolitan area that
                    provided farm produce for the metropolitan area in east central Kansas. So it
                    was an interesting district to represent. In Congress I wasn't on any of the
                    committees that were directly involved with foreign affairs, but I was on the
                    House NATO Task Force, and that was interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which party?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: I was a Republican.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any foreign policy issues come up during your
                        campaigns, or anything like that, from your district, or were you given any
                        messages from your district on foreign policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: Yes. Our district was a standard, conservative district. The issues at
                    that time of course, in the 1960 campaign, the foreign policy issue was the
                    missile balance with the Soviet Union, and the attitudes toward Cuba. And if
                    you'll remember in 1960, Kennedy ran to the right of Nixon on both of those
                    issues. Our district was very down the middle on that. The district was a
                    Republican district, but I expect that we were a little bit to the right of Mr.
                    Nixon at that time on that issue. And then during the period from '61 to '67,
                    first you had the Cuban missile crisis in 1962; then you had the Kennedy speech
                    at the American University commencement in June of 1963 in which he said, “Well,
                    we must reexamine our attitude toward the Soviet Union,” and proposed a
                    comprehensive test ban treaty. Then he was assassinated in the fall of '63 and
                    Johnson became president. And Johnson not only deepened our involvement in
                    Vietnam, but also pursued the beginnings of d�tente with his Glassboro summit
                    with Kosygin in 1967. But in our district, I think our district certainly didn't
                    have any left wing, or really any extreme right wing views on those issues. We
                    were very much middle of the road, and down the center with the rest of the
                    country as far as that's concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was this NATO Task Force in Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: It was an informal group of members of the House, no Senators in it,
                    who concerned ourselves with NATO issues. Eisenhower, of course, in the ''50s
                    had consolidated NATO by bringing Germany in, and allowing Germany to be fully
                    armed. But the question still was, well, what about Germany? And you'll remember
                    that Kennedy went over to Berlin in—I think it must have been '61 or early
                    '62—and made his speech at the Berlin wall, “Ich bin ein Berliner.” Mac Bundy
                    later told me that as they flew in the airplane into Berlin, Kennedy asked him,
                    “What shall I say, Mac?” And Mac just came up with that off the top of his head,
                    and of course it was a great success, a very emotional thing.</p>
                <p>The question was, “Well, what about Germany? What about Germany's role? What
                    about the United States' commitment?” I mean these were the questions in
                    Congress at that time. It was basically, and fundamentally, a question of
                    refining the details and mastering the nuances of a consolidated alliance which
                    Eisenhower, as I say, had consolidated during his presidency during the ''50s by
                    bringing in Germany into the alliance. That was basically the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the Vietnam war commitment getting bigger and bigger,
                        did you find in Congress that this was having an effect on the attitude
                        towards NATO by members of Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: No, it did not. Certainly it was a divisive issue in Congress, that is
                    Vietnam was, the deepening and intensifying commitment, as it was in my state
                    and in my district. But, no, I don't think it had any...the only way in which
                    NATO came into effect was the fact that we NATO buffs, and the whole National
                    Security establishment, realized that what we were doing was taking out of our
                    forces in Europe, hollowing out our divisions. We didn't change the force
                    structure of NATO. The number of divisions, the number of air wings, the number
                    of naval units, etc., remained the same but they were all being hollowed out by
                    having personnel taken away from them and sent over to Vietnam.</p>
                <p>In the late '60s and early '70s that began to reverse itself, and war hardened
                    and experienced non-coms and officers were coming back from Vietnam into the
                    force structure in Europe. In the early ''60s and the middle ''60s that was one
                    issue. The hollowing out of US forces in Europe when the Soviets, for their part
                    in Central Europe, were not hollowing out at all. On the contrary, continued of
                    course, to build up, and build up, and culminating, as we know in the Soviet
                    invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>The other issue that related to NATO, and tied in with the Vietnam situation was,
                    the basic strategic issue that came up in the form of, what does the Vietnam
                    involvement of the United States mean for the United States' credibility in its
                    commitment to nuclear deterrence on a worldwide basis, but particularly in
                    Europe. One side argued—Dean Rusk was the main arguer for the proposition that
                    our commitment, and involvement, and engagement in Vietnam was essential to
                    maintain our credibility on a worldwide basis to our other allies on the nuclear
                    deterrent commitment. The opposite argument, which I urged both when I was
                    ambassador to NATO and later on in the 1970s when I became Assistant Secretary,
                    and then Deputy Secretary of Defense, was that, on the contrary, our over
                    commitment, and over extension in the Vietnam situation, where we didn't really
                    have a reliable ally, and where we did not have a basic national interest; that
                    our over commitment to that situation undermined our credibility with our other
                    allies around the world because it demonstrated that we were not able to
                    identify and take care of our proper national interests, and that that
                    undermined our credibility with other allies. So those were the two.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you, as a member of Congress during the '60
                        period, view the Soviet threat? Was this a real one did you feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: Absolutely, of course. I mean objectively a real threat, no question
                    about it. You could count the beans—bean counters—count the tanks; count the
                    personnel; observe the exercises; keep track of the modernization of the
                    weapons; etc. It was a real threat. And read the doctrine, and read the
                    statements of the leadership, both political and military. No question but what
                    it was a real threat. And, of course, the key to it being understood as a real
                    threat was the specific doctrine which the Soviet military had at that time of
                    saying, “Well, we Soviets are defensive only,” but then they would define
                    defense as being a doctrine and a military strategy, and a tactic which on the
                    slightest political sign of hostility from NATO, would justify a preemptive
                    strike against NATO, technically on the military side, as a valid defensive
                    move. It created a very hair-trigger kind of a situation. No, it was a real
                    threat, no question in my mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're trying to recreate the period for the time. How did
                        you feel dealing with this, and obviously you were able to look at papers,
                        talk to people, visit. Did you see NATO being able to put up a defense along
                        the Rhine, or anything like this? Or did you see this thing going within a
                        very short time into a nuclear exchange?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: I always felt it would not go quickly toward a nuclear exchange. In
                    fact, I always felt that the posture of NATO was a sufficient deterrent because
                    obviously the Soviet planners, on the Soviet side, under the circumstances that
                    always existed as long as I was there, would never be able to tell their masters
                    in the Kremlin that there was a high degree of certainty that they could get
                    away with an attack. Either, on a purely conventional basis, because NATO
                    maintained a robust conventional force structure as opposed to the Soviets. Not
                    a dominant, and not an overwhelming force structure, but of course, NATO always
                    tried to compensate for its numerical inferiority with technical superiority.
                    And I always felt that that was pretty solid. But in addition, the military
                    planners in the Soviet Union could never tell their masters in the Kremlin what
                    would happen with regard to a nuclear exchange; that there was a high
                    probability of going to war with Western Europe and avoiding a nuclear exchange.
                    They never could tell them that. So I felt that deterrence would work. If
                    deterrence failed, I felt that NATO would be able to put up a robust defense,
                    and inflict a lot of punishment on an attacking force without going nuclear. But
                    the nuclear thing I always felt was necessary as a part of the overall seamless
                    web of deterrence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the departure of France. That happened during
                        the time...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: No, that happened just before I came. That happened in 1967, I came in
                    1969. The departure of France was designed by De Gaulle to destroy NATO, but it
                    didn't destroy NATO. And it wasn't long—in fact by the time I got there in 1969,
                    there was already extensive collaboration and cooperation between the French
                    military forces and the forces of NATO. And that has, of course, continued and
                    even deepened to this very day. By the time I got there in the summer of 1969,
                    there was a French general posted at NATO SACEUR's military headquarters for the
                    purposes of cooperation and liaison between the French military and the NATO
                    military structure. They were not integrated into the military structure, but
                    what does that mean; because there was this liaison in the Mediterranean; there
                    was extensive and deep and intensive cooperation—joint operations, you might
                    say—between the French navy and the Sixth Fleet; and particularly as far as
                    naval surveillance was concerned. And just a couple of weeks ago, interestingly
                    enough, I presided at a conference in London on the lessons of the Gulf war in
                    1990-1991. There was a French general present. The question came up, “How did
                    the French forces coordinate, and cooperate, in the Gulf war, particularly in
                    the land attack but also in the air preparation for the land attack, with the
                    allied forces—with the Americans and with the British?” His answer, and the
                    answer of the British commanders who were there, and of the American generals
                    who were there at this conference, were all the same. There was a little kind of
                    humorous thing—the French forces, which was a light division of Foreign
                    Legionnaires, which acted as a screen on the left flank in an absolutely
                    essential military operation, got along beautifully with the Americans because
                    the Americans forces with whom they had to operate on the left flank were the
                    82nd Airborne and both the Foreign Legionnaires and the 82nd Airborne were
                    animals and so they all understood each other perfectly. But seriously,
                    everybody said, including the French generals, that there was very smooth
                    cooperation, and coordination between the forces. Why? Because, he said, “For 30
                    years we've been training with; planning with; cooperating with; communicating
                    with; the British and American forces in NATO.” It goes back a long way.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you become an ambassador to NATO? You served from

                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: Yes. I asked President Nixon, the incoming President, if he would
                    consider sending me over as his ambassador to NATO. And he said he'd be
                    delighted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in NATO when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: I would say the Alliance was well established. The Germans were well
                    integrated. The French liaison and coordination was well established. The only
                    problem was this question of the hollowing out of the American forces by sending
                    sophisticated, experienced non-coms, and junior officers back over to Vietnam in
                    large numbers. But the situation on the ground was basically solid. The
                    deterrent was in place. There were refinements and developments always taking
                    place in SACEUR's strategic strike plan. And concerns, as there usually are,
                    about readiness, and about training, and about morale. But the main thing that
                    was going on in NATO, and in the summer of 1969—early 1969 and the middle of
                    1969—was the question of NATO's attitude towards strategic arms limitation talks
                    with the Soviet Union. You will remember, if you stop for a moment, that the
                    very first thing that Nixon did after he was sworn in as President in late
                    January of '69 was—within 30 days he'd done this—to take a trip to Europe. He
                    went to Germany, he went to Italy, he went to France, he went to Belgium—the
                    headquarters of NATO. He didn't go there just because it was Belgium, but
                    because it was NATO headquarters; and he went to London—not necessarily in that
                    order. The purpose of that trip was to explain to the key members of the
                    Alliance, and to the headquarters of the Alliance, what he had in mind for
                    strategic arms limitation talks with the Soviet Union. Why did he do that?
                    Because he knew that the West Europeans depended on our strategic deterrent as
                    the backbone and the central nervous system, if you will, of their national
                    security in the face of the Soviet threat. So he wanted to explain to them that
                    what he had in mind negotiating with the Soviets was not anything that would
                    diminish the capability, and the commitment, and the structure of the American
                    deterrent, but rather what he had in mind was, a mutual limitation on both
                    sides—both super powers—that he hoped would increase, rather than decrease the
                    national security of the West Europeans; both by limiting the technical means of
                    the nuclear forces, and also would increase their security by diminishing the
                    tensions; by addressing what by that time had become the central political
                    symbol of the age which was nuclear weaponry. And that he was going to negotiate
                    with the Soviets, but he was going to keep them fully informed. Not that he
                    would give them a veto over what he could negotiate, but he would keep them
                    fully informed. Basically that was his main charge to me. “Ellsworth, go over
                    there and use your political clout with me which is well known in Washington and
                    in Europe, to make the Washington bureaucracy keep the Europeans informed, and
                    to make sure that the Europeans have an opportunity, and feel that they have an
                    opportunity, to have input into this negotiating process.” So that was the main
                    thing that was going on.</p>

                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: In this particular task, I would say, my greatest effort was focused
                    on making sure that our negotiators would stop in Brussels every time they went
                    over to Vienna or Helsinki for a negotiating session, would keep us fully
                    informed as they negotiated along, and would stop in Brussels on the way back to
                    Washington. And also to bring State Department officials over, and Defense
                    Department officials, and to make sure that when the Secretary of Defense,
                    Laird, came over that he didn't just talk about Vietnam all the time, but that
                    he talk about this. My main effort was focused on getting our own bureaucracy to
                    really take the Europeans, to a large extent, not 100%, of course, into their
                    confidence and to listen to the Europeans. So that in this process of attempting
                    to reach an agreement with the Soviets on strategic arms limitations, that you
                    didn't at the same time shoot yourself in the foot, as an American government,
                    by undermining their confidence and their feeling of security in the Alliance.
                    That was the main...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Henry Kissinger was not yet at his peak of influence and
                        power, but it was obviously there, and he tended to do things in a secretive
                        manner. Was this a problem with the National Security Council for you at
                        that time of keeping open lines of communication?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: No, that was no problem. The problem was the State Department. There
                    was no problem with Kissinger. Kissinger understood perfectly well what was
                    going on, and what was necessary. And Kissinger himself would stop off in
                    Brussels every now and then—flying in his KC-135, and landing all by himself.
                    And I'd go out and meet him, and we'd drive in and then he'd come and tell the
                    NATO council what was going on and then he'd go out and take off again. And he
                    and his people on the NSC staff were no problem at all. The problem was the
                    State Department.</p>

                <p>ELLSWORTH: Well, the State Department is always the same, I mean, you know, they
                    have their own games that they like to play, and they feel as if everybody
                    should know already what to do, and how to do it. It was just difficult to get
                    them to schedule people to stop off.</p>

                <p>ELLSWORTH: Oh, we had no problem with them because what I did (and they were all
                    very interested in what was going on in NATO), so what I did, one by one, I
                    would invite them down, or up or over, or wherever they were geographically
                    located, to Brussels for two or three days, and I'd give a cocktail party in
                    their honor; and then a little dinner party in their honor; and then I'd have
                    them out and have them briefed by our staff; and we'd take them in and meet the
                    Secretary General, and the chairman of the NATO military committee. We went to
                    great lengths, and they would go to great lengths to respond, and they loved it,
                    and they benefited a lot from it, and their staffs. Maybe that was the
                    politician in me, seeing that they would be worried, and that it would be a good
                    thing to have them come in and feel as if they'd been brought into the inner
                    circle and knew everything that was going on. And that was a great success—all
                    of the West European ambassadors.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: Rogers kind of brought that all on himself. I mean he took a very...I
                    don't know what kind of an attitude to describe it. For example, I remember one
                    time I was back in Washington and the President gave a White House dinner, a
                    small dinner with just a few of us. I remember Rogers coming in and laughing in
                    his lighthearted...a very charming man, very intelligent man, and he said, “What
                    in the hell is the NPG?” Well, I mean, for a Secretary of State not to know what
                    the Nuclear Planning Group was, not to know what the NPG was, and he really
                    didn't know. He just hadn't taken the trouble...this was months and months after
                    he'd been Secretary of State. He'd been to a couple of NATO Foreign Ministers'
                    meetings, so Rogers' attitude was...well, he already knew a great deal about the
                    world and everything and he wasn't going to bother himself to get involved. So I
                    mean I think Rogers brought a lot of that on himself—a devil- may-care attitude.
                    A very charming man, I like him a lot, but good God!</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: Yes, yes, constantly. I mean the allies would raise this question
                    about—two questions—about the hollowing out of the American forces, and what did
                    that mean in terms of the American commitment, and in terms of a stalwart
                    defense, and in terms of overall deterrence, number one. Number two,
                    particularly I remember the British Minister of Defense, a very famous Labor
                    politician, not only he, but many, many others made the argument that Vietnam
                    was an over commitment, as they saw it, to a situation where we did not have an
                    independent vital national interest other than just this idea of our own
                    credibility. And they made the point, which I think was correct, that our over
                    commitment, and over involvement, actually undermined our credibility in so far
                    as it showed that we weren't quite a sharp as we might be on identifying, and
                    then taking care of our true national interests. I think that's correct. As a
                    matter of fact, I thought it was so correct that before I was appointed to NATO,
                    I had run for the Senate in Kansas in 1966 and I made that very argument myself
                    in the political campaign. I was defeated, but I was running against an
                    incumbent Senator and I still think it was a correct political and strategic
                    argument. Denis Healey is the name I was trying to remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the Minister of Defense. As you were doing this,
                        talking to President Nixon, and as you say, you were close to him, was he
                        giving you assurances that he was going to take care of this Vietnam
                        problem, and sort of “keep the faith, we'll get back to NATO.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: Well, he did, and as a matter of fact ultimately— maybe even while I
                    was there—I'm a little bit confused because you know, I went out of the
                    government, and then I came back into the government in '74 as Assistant
                    Secretary of Defense, and then ultimately I was the Deputy Secretary of Defense.
                    But in any case, sometime in the early ''70s when in fact NATO was fenced off
                    and made a kind of a sanctuary, both financially in terms of appropriations and
                    personnel-wise. The military and the bureaucracy in the Congress all kind of
                    agreed, “Okay, we've hollowed NATO out enough here in the past. We're going to
                    build it up a little bit and then we're not going to touch it.” So it became a
                    kind of sanctuary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Nixon Doctrine and withdrawal business...I was

                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: Vietnamization, that was Laird's thing, Vietnamization; that
                    Vietnamization would turn the situation over to the Vietnamese, and that did
                    begin to happen under Laird. That's true, Vietnamization, I remember that. I
                    guess maybe Vietnamization had started under Clark Clifford but didn't get much
                    of a play until Laird came in and made it central, and Nixon.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: Of course, the Soviet Union as we now know under Brezhnev, and what
                    the Soviets now call the period of stagnation. And, of course, Nixon's maneuver
                    with his opening to China, diminished Moscow's room for maneuver on the
                    international political scene. I mean they hated it because it diminished their
                    room for maneuver. So he set the Soviets up with his opening to China, and then
                    he came in and got this treaty with them, which eased the United States'
                    position in the world. Remember, this was a strategic arms limitation agreement,
                    not a reduction agreement, just a limitation agreement. And it was a very kind
                    of mechanical bean counting thing. It said nothing at all about qualitative
                    improvements. It really limited missile launchers, as compared with what is
                    going on now. We're trying to negotiate in the summer of 1991 a reduction treaty
                    with the Soviet Union which addresses itself to warheads, and missiles, not just
                    launchers. So it wasn't much but it did reduce tensions. It didn't reduce the
                    technical qualitative nature of the Soviet threat, but it eased, if you will,
                    the political psychological strain in the world. I mean the whole Nixon maneuver
                    of the opening to China, and then the agreement with the Russians kind of eased
                    the burden on the United States. It really transformed in some substantial way
                    the structure of the international system.</p>

                <p>ELLSWORTH: They were—of course, Greece and Turkey...I remember when Helmut
                    Schmidt became Defense Minister of Germany. He came to his first Defense
                    Ministers meeting, and there was a break around the table in the formal session,
                    and he came around to Laird and me and started bitching at us—that is the only
                    word— about why didn't Greece and Turkey contribute to the infrastructure fund
                    of NATO, a big multibillion dollar fund that builds infrastructure for the NATO
                    forces and every nation contributes to it in a percentage that's negotiated. And
                    I said to him, because Laird didn't quite have the answer on the tip of his
                    tongue, I said, “Mr. Minister, Greece and Turkey don't contribute to NATO, they
                    receive from NATO.” And they were receiving a lot of money from us mainly, but
                    also from other wealthier Europeans in terms of military aid. So, of course,
                    they wouldn't contribute to the infrastructure fund because they didn't have the
                    money. Greece and Turkey, you had to deal with them separately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Separately, but very equally.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: Separately, but very equally. Well, it wasn't really equal because
                    they had different sized military, but in all they understood what the balance
                    was, and what the conventions were for 40 to 60, or whatever the balance in a
                    relationship was. And it wasn't easy. I mean, that couldn't be at the center of
                    one's attention at NATO headquarters, although you had to handle it. And the
                    Greeks and the Turks were always good at sending military people, and diplomats,
                    to NATO headquarters who were very sophisticated, and sensible people, and
                    grown-ups, and adults. The real nut cutting, if you will, on the Greek-Turkish
                    conflict, came up down in the southern region and had to be handled by CINCSOUTH
                    who is usually, if not always, an American admiral based in Naples, and it was
                    he who had to work out how to actually have a NATO exercise over the Aegean
                    region without erupting itself into a war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know, I was Consul General in Naples when Admiral Crowe
                        was there and he used to shake his head about...I had served four years in
                        Greece so I was familiar with that element of the equation. The historic
                        roots are such that probably it will never be solved. Were there any other
                        major problems that you had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: Yes, there was another very interesting kind of major problem at that
                    time, and that was, the technology transfer question. Not in the sense of
                    America trying to hold back technology from the Europeans, but on the contrary;
                    the European allies within NATO wanting, for developmental reasons of their
                    technology and of their industry, to have a share in the big NATO technology
                    projects. For example, there was something called NICS which got off the ground
                    while I was there, mainly done by IBM and Hughes—NATO Integrated Communication
                    System, a whole new structure for NATO communication involving satellites, and
                    computers. In the late ''60s and early ''70s it was a marvel. Today it would be
                    regarded as quite primitive but that was one of the big problems the whole time
                    I was there. How much of a share in that would they have, so they could learn
                    about these new communicating and computer, and satellite technologies? That's
                    not a strategic issue but it was a very important issue. And I would say a
                    problem. It was also a problem because of the fact that the requirements for the
                    NICS, the NATO Integrated Communication System, were at the edge of new
                    technology, and even Hughes and IBM had a lot of trouble coming up with stuff
                    that would work, and would meet the requirements. So that was an interesting
                    part of the job too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you fend off the other countries then that wanted
                        to get in on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: Well, you didn't fend them off. You tried to get them in to a certain
                    extent. But the answer always was, “Well, if you're qualified here,” of course
                    they weren't qualified, they knew that, so it was always a question to
                    negotiate. But if you couldn't fend them off, what you had to do was try to work
                    with the American contractors, and with the Department of Defense—the Defense
                    Communications Agency—to get it politically so that the Europeans felt that they
                    did have a fair shot at learning a little something here, and would be
                    satisfied.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problem—talking about equipment—with
                        matters such as main battle tanks, or airplanes, or rifles, or something, to
                        have the brief that you were to push American equipment even if you found
                        that NATO was producing something better?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: No, a lot of that came up in the middle and late ''70s, but it did not
                    begin to come up in the time that I was there. American military technology was
                    so obviously superior to everybody that there was just no problem. I mean, for
                    example, take the F-4 airplane which today is an antique...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the Phantom.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: Today it is an antique, but in the late ''60s and early ''70s it was
                    the dominant military aircraft in the world, and it wasn't until really the late
                    ''70s when the F-16 and the F-15 came in, and the A-10 and all of those wonders
                    at that time, and the Jaguar—the Jaguar was just beginning to get talked
                    about...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Jaguar was mainly a British plane.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: A British fighter bomber. But at the time I was there the Jaguar was
                    just a gleam in the eye of some of the British industrialists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel under any constraints because of spying.
                        NATO, of course, and Europe, spying is an ancient and honorable
                        profession.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: An ancient and honorable profession, that's right. Well, of course, we
                    had our NATO procedures, and we had our special American procedures, and you had
                    to be careful. We had to worry about those things but we didn't have any big spy
                    scandals during the time I was there fortunately. I don't think that was due to
                    my rigidity on fending them off, but the whole system worked pretty well, I
                    think, during the time I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your attitude, and those around, towards
                        Sweden? A neutral country, but relatively powerful for a relatively small
                        country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: We didn't talk about Sweden much but it was well understood that
                    Sweden was kind of a sixteenth member of the Alliance, and they were. They had
                    good military equipment. I went up to Sweden and visited their military
                    installations, and their Defense Ministry, and so forth, one time. They were
                    strictly neutral, absolutely neutral, no question about that. But you knew if
                    there actually were a war, you knew where Sweden would be, and you knew that
                    they would cause major problems to any kind of Soviet military operation in
                    Europe, major problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any ties? I mean, did you have a Sweden book
                        and say, “If this happens...”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: No, absolutely not. It would be political dynamite to have had
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there wasn't any, not covert, but it was self
                        understood.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: It was informally understood, and it was well understood.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think it was well understood in Sweden too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: Absolutely, no question, oh yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they read our textbooks and things like this so they'd
                        know what we did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: Yes, and there's a lot of exchange at military to military level. Not
                    at NATO, that would have been a little bit too dangerous, but between Washington
                    and Stockholm for decades there's been a good exchange, military to military,
                    its well understood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your staff? How did you find...you said the
                        State Department tends to run in bureaucratic ways. Coming in did you find
                        you had support, or did you sort of have to shake up the staff, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: No, I had a strong staff. My deputy moved on and became ambassador to
                    Pakistan just a few months after I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: I can't remember his name. And then I identified a guy that I wanted
                    as my deputy, who was already in Brussels, named George Vest. He was working for
                    Bob Schaetzel as the ambassador to the EC, so I had to be very careful and I
                    talked it over with Schaetzel, we delayed, but finally I got George Vest to be
                    my DCM. He was wonderful, and I had Larry Eagleburger as my Political Adviser
                    and he was superb; and had Ray Garthoff as my Arms Control Adviser, and he was
                    brilliant and outstanding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about people who not only has this program
                        interviewed, but you couldn't ask for a stronger group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: Absolutely. Martin van Heuven, who just retired from the CIA as
                    National Intelligence Officer for Europe, he was on our political staff. Oh,
                    yes, fantastic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to move on and touch if we may the international
                        aspects of your time as...is there anything else I should cover in this
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: No, time is passing so I think if you've covered your points, that's
                    fine with me. I think we've covered the main points.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Do I have a second to touch on your Department of
                        Defense...you became Deputy Secretary of Defense in 1975 to '77, is that
                        right. You had two jobs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: I came in in the summer of '74 as Assistant Secretary of Defense. I
                    think it was in late '75 that I became Deputy Secretary, and then, of course, I
                    left in January of '77 when the administration changed from Ford to Carter
                    because I was a political appointee from the Republican administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the international aspects of this job as Deputy
                        Secretary of Defense?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: Well, the whole spectrum. I mean it was everything. First of all, it
                    was the pits being in the Department of Defense at that time because of the
                    Vietnam collapse; and the rundown in the Defense budget. I was talking to
                    Scowcroft about this a few months ago...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Brent Scowcroft.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: Brent Scowcroft, who was Jerry Ford's National Security Adviser. He
                    and I were reminiscing the other day—a few months ago—about that time, and we
                    agreed that it was the pits to be in Defense and National Security at that time
                    because it was very unpopular, and everything was running down, and the Vietnam
                    collapse, etc. And, as Deputy Secretary, what I did as Deputy Secretary was, I
                    was sort of in charge of intelligence for the Defense Department which, of
                    course, makes up 80% of the budget and supplies 80% of the people to the
                    intelligence community. And at that time you'll remember we had the Pike
                    Committee which was attacking the whole intelligence community, and the
                    appropriation committees too, so that was a strenuous time. And as far as what
                    was international about it, well, it was the whole world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that our allies were changing in their
                        attitudes towards the United States at this time, beginning to worry about
                        our troop commitment? Our military was in some disarray. We had left rather
                        ignominiously from Saigon. Did you find that you had to be part of a team to
                        go around and say, “we're really with you,” particularly in NATO?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: We would go over to these NATO meetings. I mean you know there are two
                    big sets of NATO meetings every six months. There's a Foreign Ministers meeting,
                    and then there's the Defense Ministers meeting, and then in association with the
                    Defense Ministers meeting, there's always a meeting with the Military Committee
                    which is the Chiefs of Staff of the Alliance. So you are in constant contact
                    with NATO. You don't have to go and do anything at NATO, you're always in
                    contact with NATO. Yes, there was some of that and, of course, by this time the
                    middle ''70s, the period of stagnation in the Soviet Union had really set in,
                    and Brezhnev was really doddering around. And then, of course; there was also
                    politically here at home; there was Ford sitting as President, a Republican, and
                    it was obvious in '75 and early '76 that he was going to be challenged for the
                    nomination by Reagan, the former governor of California, who was way off to the
                    right, and it was for that reason that Ford in November of '74, after Nixon had
                    resigned...Ford and Kissinger went over to Vladivostok and met with Brezhnev to
                    try to get a SALT II agreement initialed and they failed because Ford was afraid
                    of being criticized from the right. So that was a breakdown in this strategic
                    arms process which Nixon had started in '69, and which the Europeans understood
                    to be in their security interest, and here it was breaking down. Well, what did
                    that mean? And how could you interpret and understand that? So, as Americans, we
                    were on the defensive there with regard to that particular issue, in addition to
                    the collapse in Saigon, etc. So it was a difficult period of time. And the Pike
                    committee with its amazing and shocking revelations, and the Church
                    committee.</p>

                <p>ELLSWORTH: ...Senator Church, the CIA as a rogue elephant, and on and on and on,
                    so it was tough. The basic fact was, and in a sense I mean the kind of chaos
                    that you and I have sort of reviewed here in a twinkling of an eye, got the
                    Europeans and the Japanese, and everybody else, to look at their hole card with
                    regard to the American role in the world. And when they looked at their hole
                    card, they could see that, notwithstanding everything; and after all that;
                    America with its military power; with its population; with its resources; and
                    with its remoteness from most of the conflicts in the world; and with its wide
                    ranging diplomatic alliances—I mean friends with the Arabs as well as with the
                    Israelis; and negotiating with the Russians—that there wasn't any alternative.
                    They better stick together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And hope for the best. Did you have any feeling while you
                        were there, and you had your intelligence network there, that the Soviets
                        were changing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking 1991, and we've seen the absolute collapse
                        of the Soviet Union as an economic structure. But were there feelings then
                        that maybe they were over extending.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: There was no question about it, and it was more than feelings. It was
                    an analysis because it was when I was in the Pentagon in the '74-'75 period,
                    that we in the Pentagon, if I may say so, forced the CIA to radically revise its
                    estimates of Soviet GNP downward from what the estimates had been. And therefore
                    to revise the percentage of burden on the GNP, of the military buildup up
                    radically—up to near 20% of GNP. So I mean it was more than feelings. It was
                    analysis, and you could see it at that time, and we said so at that time. And it
                    even leaked into the press what the Pentagon was saying at that time, and that
                    was mostly, if I may say so, Schlesinger and me saying it. That the Soviets
                    probably were making, and had made, the greatest strategic blunder in history by
                    over burdening themselves with this tremendous military buildup and that it was
                    going to destroy them sometime. We didn't say when.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this change our Defense posture at all? I mean was it
                        still considered a hair trigger situation, or were you feeling that things
                        were settling down a little the more?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: I think we felt that things were settling down and it wasn't as hair
                    triggered, although you had to have in the back of your mind the thought that,
                    as Brezhnev deteriorated and deteriorated, and the situation in the Soviet Union
                    deteriorated and deteriorated, that you had to have in the back of your mind the
                    thought that, “Well, sometimes when a sick animal is dying he lashes out.” So
                    you had to have that in the back of your mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question. How did you find, from a different
                        viewpoint of the Department of Defense, State Department response to Defense
                        problems? Had things changed at all now that Kissinger was there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: Just speaking from experience, and with all due respect and even a lot
                    of affection and admiration for a lot of my friends in the State Department—I
                    mean, I've named some of them here—George Vest, Larry Eagleburger, I could name
                    dozens of them. The fact of the matter is that, institutionally, I feel, and
                    have for decades, that the State Department...and probably this is wise for your
                    Foreign Ministry...is a little bit behind the power curve on what's going on in
                    the outer world. The reason I say that's probably wise for a Foreign Ministry is
                    because if you're too eager to read, and to see changes, and to respond to them,
                    you might get it wrong. And the costs of that could be too great. So I think its
                    fine for the State Department to be reluctant, and behind the power curve, and
                    to be skeptical when people say, “Oh, this is changing, etc., it's different
                    now.” You've got to be careful, and you've got to be a little bit...so I don't
                    criticize them, but that's the fact that we always felt that, and I still
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, probably also a military has to be ready to meet the
                        latest threat.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: You have to, you have to be always ready.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...whereas there should be a certain break because there
                        are many of these things that the best thing to do is just to sit and wait
                        it out. I've just finished interviewing a man who is our charg� in Ethiopia
                        under Mengistu, and he said, really the thing though is just to sit it out,
                        wait it out. The man was at his peak, nothing we could do, and just wait
                        rather than get in there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: He could see the rot, I'm sure, at work. He was right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I've taken up much of your time, and I really
                        appreciate this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ELLSWORTH: It's been a pleasure.</p>
