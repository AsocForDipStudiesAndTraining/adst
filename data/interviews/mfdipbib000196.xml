                <p>AMBASSADOR FREDERIC L. CHAPIN</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Ambassador Horace G. Torbert </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: May 25, 1989</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>[Initial portion of interview not recorded.]</p>
                <p>CHAPIN: (tape in progress) The son-in-law had been a lieutenant in the Guardia
                    National and they attempted to oust Somoza the only way that was possible,
                    namely, by assassinating him. Somoza, the elder, Tacho Somoza, was in fact
                    murdered by an assassin with poison-filled bullets as he was leaving a party
                    given at the Casa del Obrero, The Workers' Club in Leon, which resulted in all
                    labor activity in Leon being shut down.</p>
                <p>I had some initial contacts who introduced me to local labor leaders in Leon and
                    together we organized the First Federation of Trade Unions which was established
                    under the new Nicaraguan labor code. We followed all of the rules and I stayed
                    in the background as much as possible but [I] sent an organizer up there whom I
                    paid for out of my own pocket, I was never reimbursed by the U. S. Government
                    for it. And, our Ambassador Whelan, who had been the Republican state chairman
                    in North Dakota was somewhat surprised at this but I told him that for an annual
                    budget of $1,500 I could organize the best trade-union movement in the country.
                    Well, when Roberto Gonzalez and his corrinto trade unionists tried to take over
                    the construction union in Managua, the ambassador took me along to see President
                    Somoza and I gave him all the facts, in essence, about Roberto Gonzalez's
                    background and his communist affiliations. But Somoza, like so many dictators,
                    chose to work with other autocrats and found it easier to work with them than
                    with the democratic movement, and so he supported the communist trade unions and
                    they did in fact sign a collective bargaining agreement with the Managua
                    construction industry.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I had sponsored the first collective bargaining agreement in Leon between the
                    construction industry and the construction union which was part of this
                    federation we established. I was carefully 50 miles away from the final signing
                    ceremony but I had brought both parties close enough together so that it was
                    certain that a collective bargaining agreement could be signed. As I mentioned,
                    Roberto Gonzalez was attempting to organize all the ports and one of the main
                    ports on the Atlantic Coast from which the Longleaf Pine Company was shipping
                    logs to the United States, an American company, was next on Roberto Gonzalez's
                    target list. So I sent the same organizer who had organized Leon over to the
                    Atlantic Coast. It will be recalled that Puerto Cabezas is the port from which
                    our ill-fated Cuban armada sailed. In those days there was nothing but a dirt
                    strip that DC-3s landed on in Puerto Cabezas.</p>
                <p>On the second trip over, we finalized arrangements for the trade union federation
                    of Puerto Cabezas and we had a festive occasion and signing ceremony. The trade
                    union federation had provided some difficulties because the workers on the pier,
                    which was being repaired so that it could take our vehicles for the invasion of
                    Cuba and the railroad, were run by former Caribbean nationals and their
                    descendants who were black and spoke English. The taxi and drivers and mechanics
                    union was composed of people who spoke only Spanish and the other two unions
                    which were part of the saw-mill and the lumbermen each spoke a different Indian
                    dialect so it was quite a complicated situation to wield that into one
                    federation but it was successful and we did keep the communists out.</p>
                <p>As with the Leon federation, Somoza eventually took over the federations. But for
                    a while, they ran on a democratic basis. In fact, the only person they trusted
                    to count the votes in the election for the first officers of the federation in
                    Leon was yours truly. I have a picture of me counting the votes with the
                    Nicaraguan government trade representative sitting in the front row.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds pretty Yankee imperialistic to me!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Well, it was all done privately. They asked me to come in and it was all
                    done on private funds, no U. S. Government money involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you cut out these funds so that they wouldn't come
                        back and bounce on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: No, I personally paid for it and I never was reimbursed. It only cost me
                    $150. That's why I told the ambassador—I could organize the best federation in
                    the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Well, another thing that happened early on, fairly early on while I was there,
                    was that the plotting against Somoza in those days was not from the left but
                    from the right. The conservatives were the ones who were trying to oust him and
                    shortly before I arrived in July there had been a vain-glorious attempt by Pedro
                    Joaquin Chamorro and a group of Nicaraguan aristocrats who landed by parachute
                    in the mountains and attempted to mount a coup from there and, of course, they
                    were all rounded up by the Guardia National and imprisoned on the hill next to
                    the President's palace, or at least their leaders.</p>
                <p>The next attempt was by Arturo Cruz and some of his cohorts in Diriamba and
                    Hinotepe, two heads of what they called departamentos. They were headed by Jefe
                    Politico, not a governor but a representative of the central power who had
                    virtually total control over those departments. These young conservatives,
                    Arturo Cruz, at the time, was managing director of the Banco Nicaraguense in
                    Diriamba, had this crazy idea which was shared by others that, if the
                    conservatives knocked over the capitals of a couple of departments, the United
                    States would still in old gunboat fashion land the Marines and separate the two
                    sides if they could hold these capitals for two weeks.</p>
                <p>I was a much better friend of Arturo's brother, Ernesto, who, by the way, served
                    as my drop for the clandestine communist paper because he had been a Marxist
                    while at the University, as was his wife. There was a meeting at Ernesto's house
                    one evening, a social event ostensibly, and Ernesto and his wife were there,
                    Arturo and his wife were there, and Cree and I were invited. The two Cruz
                    brothers had a sister who was married to somebody whose name I can't remember.
                    Anyway, we all sat around after dinner [and the] theory was espoused that, if
                    they knocked over two departmental capitals, wouldn't the United States land
                    Marines? I said, “This is crazy. This is absolutely the silliest idea I have
                    ever heard. You'll all get yourselves shot, by the way. The Guardia National is
                    much too well organized. This is absurd.”</p>
                <p>Well, I got wind that the issue continued to fester, and so the day before this
                    coup was to be launched, I went up to Diriamba and saw Arturo. He pulled me into
                    the social club where we had lunch in the darkest recess he could find, and I
                    said, “You know, this is just absurd as I told you ten days ago. This won't make
                    any sense.” Well, they persisted, and sure enough over the weekend they launched
                    on the Guardia headquarters in each of the towns and temporarily had control.
                    But the Guardia first sent in a column in their newest police cars which we had
                    provided to them because, in those days, aid to the police was not illegal as it
                    became later under the Aid Program. The Guardia National column got badly shot
                    up and ambushed, but force prevailed and the Guardia National was much too
                    strong. Indeed, they rounded up everybody except Arturo and one or two others. I
                    reported all of this, but my sources I refused to reveal to the ambassador, who
                    was the godfather of all the Somoza children.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I had the inside story, not only from having been up there but also one of the
                    prominent members of the taxi union in Managua had relatives who lived in
                    Diriamba and he was the first to bring some of the wounded Guardia back to the
                    hospital and gave me a first-hand account of the initial battle in Diriamba. So
                    there were exciting days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You should have been put in charge of the Cuban
                        campaign.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Well, I asked my uncle later, Admiral Kirk, who had been head of U. S.
                    Naval forces in Normandy as well as previously in Sicily, whether anybody had
                    consulted him or any of the other amphibious experts. On his virtual deathbed at
                    Bethesda Naval Hospital he told me that no one had been consulted that he knew
                    of and he himself at the time was working on a CIA project. So that was very
                    badly bungled.</p>
                <p>I was out of Nicaragua by the time the actual Bay of Pigs incident took place. I
                    had just arrived in the Chad as charg�. The French high representative, who
                    really worked for French intelligence and had during the war worked for de
                    Gaulle, was very critical of our generals and admirals. Unfortunately, the
                    French generals had just risen in Algiers and so I said to him, “Our generals
                    may be stupid, but at least they are loyal.” And that shut him up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you come then to move? Did you ask to get out, or
                        did they call you out to go to Chad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: No, I volunteered. They were looking for volunteers to go and open these
                    African posts and I felt that the house of cards would only stand up so long in
                    Nicaragua. So I volunteered and, of course, I spoke French. I had worked and
                    lived in Paris and I'd studied.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ambassador, of course, was about ready to leave when
                        Eisenhower left office...and you were going to have a change of boss then.
                        Do you have anything you want to add to your previous statements on Fort
                        Lamy or should we skip over that and get back to the Department again where
                        you . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: No, I think that Fort Lamy is pretty well covered. I was asked to go
                    down...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Chapin, when the tape stopped you said a little
                        bit about being assigned to the U. N., but I'm afraid we lost everything
                        after, so if you'd just like to summarize the fact that you were invited to
                        join the U.N. staff.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>CHAPIN: I was asked to go to Washington to work on the United Nations' political
                    affairs even though I was very reluctant to do so because I didn't have the
                    highest respect for the United Nations and its work as it developed. I felt that
                    the United States had very little influence although we had more influence then
                    than we were to have in some subsequent years.</p>
                <p>So I reported for work to help prepare for the fall general assembly and was
                    asked to go up to New York for a month, a month and a half, I don't remember,
                    but it was until the end of the session just before Christmas. I had the
                    opportunity to sit on the fourth committee which was largely in charge of
                    decolonization matters. The other more senior members who sat on that committee
                    were all button-holding delegates doing various useful tasks and it was thought
                    that I could just sit in a chair. Well, on several occasions, people raised
                    Puerto Rico and I took exception to the statements and cited the precedence at
                    the United Nations that had been settled earlier that Puerto Rico was an
                    integral part of the United States and that it was not a colony and, therefore,
                    it was not a proper subject for the fourth committee. I was sustained in this by
                    the Guatemalan chairman of the fourth committee and those interventions served
                    for many years as precedence for use in subsequent discussions or [dented]
                    discussions of Puerto Rico. So that was interesting and, as a native born New
                    Yorker, I was very happy to be in New York for a month.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they able to pay you per diem then in those
                        days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Yes, the per diem was paid and it was fairly inadequate. It wasn't the
                    poverty belt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess, then, if you weren't permanently assigned, they
                        couldn't pay you a living allowance, is that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Well, that's right. That was before the housing was established which was
                    later vastly misused and has been corrected to a great extent, subsequently, as
                    a result of an inspection report we did at the United Nations Headquarters in
                    '87.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you returned to Washington and did you stay longer in
                        UN affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>CHAPIN: Not very long. I worked for a while on the Congo airlift. The U. S. was
                    involved in supporting the government of the Congo at the time and this was
                    under U. N. auspices and that's where I met Owen Roberts for the first time who
                    worked with me on that aspect. I still didn't get the promised section which had
                    been the one incentive in returning to UNP. I was asked by Bill Sullivan to come
                    up and be interviewed by Averell Harriman who was seeking a new special
                    assistant. Bill Sullivan was anxious to move on. The other candidate who was a
                    very prominent Middle Eastern expert was selected, but he made the mistake of
                    having Governor Harriman sign a letter to Congressman Farbstein in which he took
                    the even-handed approach on the Arab-Israeli question and this led to an outcry
                    by Congressman Farbstein. As a native-born New Yorker, I knew where the votes in
                    New York were and wasn't going to make that mistake and was the replacement of
                    this officer who served for a very brief time, indeed. In fact, I wrote and
                    cleared with some difficulty over in the White House a partial statement which
                    was incorporated into one of Governor Harriman's many speeches and was the only
                    statement on the Middle East made by a senior official during the Kennedy
                    Administration. So that was an interesting task in mediating between the Arabs,
                    the pro-Arabs in the State Department's Middle East division and the Pro-Israeli
                    faction in the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Averell Harriman still had very considerable political
                        aspirations at that time . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: I don't know that he had any aspirations to return but he certainly had
                    important clout and he was responsible after Kennedy's assassination for
                    arranging for Robert Kennedy's campaign and nomination as Senator from New York.
                    I remember seeing all the fat cats from New York troop into Averell Harriman's
                    office and, naturally, that was one of the meetings that I did not take part
                    in.</p>
                <p>But it was a curious set-up. Just outside the Governor's office, and it's still
                    that way today although there's a curtain that is often drawn across it, is an
                    office where the special assistant sits who controls all traffic to and from the
                    Governor's desk on official matters. And, there's a solid glass wall all the way
                    down so that you can see what's going on and be beckoned to come into the
                    office.</p>
                <p>Working for Harriman was a most unusual experience. I had not been sufficiently
                    briefed by Bill Sullivan as to what to expect. He worked a full day and had
                    extraordinary hours for a man who was 75. I had to be there at 8:00 because he
                    would be there before 9:00 and I had to get all his agenda items. He was Under
                    Secretary of State for Political Affairs. He saw an amazing amount of foreign
                    dignitaries and took part in a lot of high-level meetings so there were a lot of
                    briefing papers to arrange and, of course, there was the overnight cable
                    traffic.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>I would go in as soon as the Governor arrived, and he would stand behind his desk
                    and shuffle papers and look at these briefing memoranda and all the time he
                    wanted me to brief him orally on the most important issues on his desk. He was
                    apparently paying no attention whatsoever to what I was saying, shuffling these
                    papers around, looking in his in-box, and I would go on spouting to this person
                    who was apparently paying no attention to what I had to say, and then I would
                    sit in meetings with him later in the day and my sentences would roll out.
                    Incredible!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He didn't turn his hearing aid off at that time when you
                        were talking to him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: He didn't turn it off if he wanted to hear what I had to say, but I have
                    seen him in meetings not only turn his hearing aid off but take it out. It was
                    an extraordinary performance.</p>
                <p>I was the special assistant who controlled the traffic, but he had Bill Jorden
                    who was his Special Assistant on the Far East and he had Charlie Mackling and a
                    number of other special assistants who had specific tasks assigned and would sit
                    in on those matters. So I was standing in a considerable part of the day being
                    sure that we gave Governor Harriman the material that he absolutely needed to
                    know about and also working on his speeches and other matters which came up for
                    clearance by the Governor and advising him whether he should or should not pass
                    on it.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>The most interesting case that I got involved in was a speech which G. Mennen
                    Williams was going to make at Harvard to national radio and T.V. on our policy
                    towards South Africa. Governor Harriman was away on one of his speaking tours
                    when Rudy Agree, who was the Special Assistant for Governor Williams, brought
                    out to my house one evening about 8:30 or 9:00 the text of the speech that the
                    Governor was proposing to make the next afternoon about 2:00 or 3:00 in Boston
                    and I read through the first pages and scanned the rest. Governor Williams
                    proposed to use language about South Africa which we scarcely used toward the
                    Japanese during World War II, and never used about the Germans. I said that I
                    simply could not clear this for the Governor. I said he was going to be back the
                    next morning and the first order of business [was] I underlined certain passages
                    and would discuss them with the Governor and I'm sorry that the Assistant
                    Secretary for African Affairs would have to wait until Governor Harriman had had
                    a chance to look at this personally. Well, in one of these stand-up sessions
                    that we were having, Abe Chayes, the legal advisor came in. His name appeared at
                    the bottom of the list as having cleared it, and Harriman said, “Have you
                    cleared this?” And Chayes said, “Yes.” Harriman said to me, “Fred, you read him
                    that sentence.” So I read him the sentence. “Did you approve that?” Chayes
                    looked very embarrassed. “Fred, read him that next sentence.” And this went on
                    and then Joe Sisco came in. He was then Assistant Secretary for International
                    Affairs and his name appeared as having cleared it. Harriman said, “Joe, did you
                    clear this?” Joe said, “Yes.” “Read him the sentence.” Well, at that point
                    Chayes and Sisco and I adjourned to this glass-walled cubicle that I had outside
                    the Governor's office and Assistant Secretary G. Mennen Williams came up. Chayes
                    and Sisco began reading this document for the first time. Somebody had cleared
                    it in their offices and they started scratching out great sections and the next
                    thing I knew, this whole party adjourned to the White House to McGeorge Bundy's
                    office where they cut out huge sections and, meanwhile, cancelled national and
                    radio coverage for the Harvard speech. It was a much emasculated . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It had all been written, I presume, by Wayne Fredericks,
                        hadn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: I don't know who had written it and never bothered to investigate it, but
                    I am quite certain that if the original speech had been given, South Africa
                    would have broken relations with the United States and for what I considered
                    just cause and which my peers at the Assistant Secretary level when they finally
                    read the speech agreed was not consistent. McGeorge Bundy was even more violent
                    than had been the others, so that was the one time that I think that I really
                    earned my pay and earned an important role in that instance for Governor
                    Harriman. It does show that even a Special Assistant can be sometimes of use in
                    shaping policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think a lot of policy is created by the initial drafter
                        of a telegram which is usually somebody even further down the line.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: I think that was good work.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fascinating work. Now, did you move over to AID right
                        after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Well, I had been on that job as Special Assistant for two years and I
                    said that Harriman had work habits that were intensive. He was there until 8:00
                    every night, five days a week and Saturday he'd come in maybe at 9:30 or so and
                    would stay until 6:00. In fact, I recall one Saturday afternoon he turned to me
                    as I was sitting in his office and he said, “Fred, what are we going to do this
                    afternoon?” And, I thought we had done quite a lot. And, Sundays I had to go
                    down to the Department and read the telegrams, make a selection, and take them
                    out to his house. I didn't have the benefit of any State Department driver on
                    Sundays and had to slog through the slush and whatnot of Georgetown. I was
                    terrified of having an accident and having all this highly classified material
                    on me in transit to the Governor's house and on return from the Governor's house
                    to the Department to lock it up securely. So that [on] Sundays I wouldn't get
                    back to lunch until about 3:00, so this was a 6-1/2 day-a-week job. I rarely saw
                    the children before they went to bed. They were very young.</p>
                <p>The result was that, when I was asked by the AID Administrator if I would come
                    over and be the Executive Secretary of the AID agency, I agreed provided
                    Governor Harriman would agree and he did. So I went to work for David Bell as
                    Executive Secretary. But first there was a detour because the Executive
                    Secretary didn't leave on schedule and I worked for the Deputy AID
                    Administrator, Bill Gowan. That job I found to be less than I had expected but
                    there were some interesting times. I did learn about the AID bureaucracy and how
                    it worked and how various kinds of AID applications were handled and it stood me
                    in good stead in a subsequent post.</p>
                <p>During this period I was asked to be Deputy Chief of Mission at several embassies
                    and finally my time in Washington was running out. It was longer than most
                    people had been there. So I did accept to go to Cameroon as DCM but then I was
                    found to have a congenital medical problem and the Department would not clear my
                    going abroad and I was treated for about a year and a half and I went on some
                    various administrative assignments including the first two international
                    personnel reduction campaigns during the Nixon Administration. One of those took
                    me on a special mission to Central America where I was to conduct an intensive
                    review of the staffing of the five Central American countries, Nicaragua, Costa
                    Rica, Honduras, and Guatemala and Panama, and I was able to make a number of
                    recommendations which saved a lot of money including elimination of an
                    administrative radio network in these countries which was [reporting to
                    CINCSOUTH] in Panama and which did not transmit any classified information,
                    therefore, really didn't have any security function. But each country had a
                    radio station and served to convey administrative chatter and social chatter and
                    commissary orders. . .</p>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>CHAPIN: Yes. It was under a private contract and costing millions of dollars a
                    year and a series of other personnel cuts. That was called Balpa 2, Phase 2. One
                    of the things that I did was to recommend that the only military aircraft be
                    located in Honduras where the Air Force played a much more prominent role than
                    in any of the other Central American countries and that the Senior Defense
                    Attach� be the pilot and head of the crew. That remained that way for years and
                    was still that way when I left Guatemala in 1984 and that was a consolidation .
                    . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That cut out of a crew at least 15 people in every post in
                        Central America.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Well, in several, in a couple of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I discovered it's going to take 15 people for me to have a
                        plane in Somalia and I never had one for that reason. I was damned if I was
                        going to have 15 more people on the staff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Well, it was expensive. The housing and everything that went with it, and
                    we also were able to reduce staff to manageable levels. Well, from these various
                    administrative jobs I was asked by Robert Sayer when I finished that tour of
                    duty in Balpa to be the officer in charge of Panamanian affairs. Well, the
                    principal task of Panamanian affairs was to develop proposals for a Panama Canal
                    Treaty in that particular time which was 1968. It didn't look as if Panama Canal
                    Treaty negotiations were likely to be imminent and they were not for several
                    years until President Carter was elected and negotiations began but that was
                    several years hence. So I asked if I could be given another assignment and I was
                    assigned to be officer in charge of Bolivia/Chile which proved to be much more
                    interesting. It was a combined operation in those days, State and AID, and my
                    deputy was an AID officer and we had the Frei government in Chile, which we were
                    supporting. Ambassador Ed Korry was a big advocate of President Frei and the
                    Christian Democrats and was advocating loans which, we thought, were unsound in
                    economic terms, had some political justification, but we were opposed to some of
                    those in the transition to the Nixon Administration.</p>
                <p>I remember going down with Pete Vaky and we argued with — we didn't argue with
                    him, he accepted our position — with William Rogers who said that we could send
                    out the message opposing the $20 million loan to Chile and that he would square
                    it that night with President Nixon. He, William Rogers, had not yet been sworn
                    in as Secretary of State but he gave us full authority to proceed. There was, of
                    course, a lot of traffic about support for the Christian Democrats and others in
                    the election campaign and that's all been reviewed by the Congress, much of it
                    highly classified. Ed Korry couldn't, in the final analysis, make up his mind
                    which side he wanted to be on, which was confusing.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>I was Country Director for Bolivia/Chile during both the nationalization of the
                    Gulf Oil Company in Bolivia, which kept me in the office every day for 55 days,
                    and the nationalization of the American copper companies in Chile. The Anaconda
                    Copper Company had very stupidly failed to keep up its payments on its
                    nationalization insurance policy under AID and sought to retroactively pay its
                    insurance which was not permitted. My earlier experience in AID proved very
                    helpful in that I knew the players and was trusted by the players in AID as
                    someone who was sympathetic to AID's point of view. It was eventually worked out
                    that we were not going to come to the rescue of the American copper
                    companies.</p>
                <p>Those were the highlights of my service for about two years from September of
                    1968 until about the end of the year of 1970 when I moved up to be Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary for Management for the Inter-American Bureau. Again it was
                    still a combined State AID operation and I had an AID deputy who handled AID
                    personnel matters largely. I [also] had working for me as the Senior Personnel
                    Officer on the State side, Joan Clark, who is now the Assistant Secretary for
                    Consular Affairs and was the former Director General of the Foreign Service.
                    Also, Sheldon Krys who is Assistant Secretary for Administrative Affairs now. So
                    we had a very good staff.</p>
                <p>My principal task in addition to or really prompted by the fact that the
                    non-immigrant visa caseload was going up in certain countries particularly in
                    the Caribbean and I had ambassadors calling me constantly about the block-long
                    lines of applicants around their embassy chanceries every day. The only way to
                    get the personnel to fill in to take care of the workload was to close
                    consulates and I traveled around the area and visited all the countries of Latin
                    America and found a number of consulates which were simply not performing any
                    meaningful task whatsoever. They had been left over for historical reasons and
                    we were able to assign those officers or their replacements to help out in these
                    critical posts because we were under an overall ceiling as a result of these
                    Balpa cuts and we had to find some place to get the personnel to handle the
                    task. It made sense to pay consular personnel to do consular work in another
                    area.</p>
                <p>The other thing we were doing with the money that we tried to save was we were
                    putting in an automated visa lookout system in the post nearest to us. It was
                    very easy in Europe because you could take a trunkline directly from the
                    computer in Washington to a central point in Europe and then branch out hub from
                    that central point at minimum cost to the other major embassies and consulates
                    and consulate generals that were issuing visas. The transatlantic cost was
                    relatively cheap and the quality of the lines was good. Toward South America in
                    the Caribbean the reverse was true. You had to have individual lines and the
                    quality was poor and we could only gradually extend the system which was a
                    timesaving and local employee-saving device.</p>

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>CHAPIN: This was for the security checks that saved an enormous amount of time
                    and greatly improved accuracy because you had an otherwise lookout book and
                    there were constant errors and people who looked at this book for an hour or two
                    which was the maximum they could look at it. Then you had to shift them to some
                    other kind of work and shift somebody back on so it was very time consuming and
                    there was no assurance that, in fact, you were getting accurate, up-to-date
                    information. So we started that process and we had also to correct a number of
                    messes left by political appointees who overspent their budget and that was a
                    problem we had to clear up.</p>
                <p>I was at that job for about a year and a half, and I had Ambassador Rountree in
                    my office who was looking for a consul general in Sao Paulo, and I handed him a
                    list of people whose assignments were coming up by this time. I had been more
                    than 8 years in Washington, in fact almost 10, [as] Under Secretary for
                    Administration. That was after Macomber said he wouldn't give me any further
                    extensions and I said, “Well, that's fine with me. I've been asked to stay on by
                    the Assistant Secretary for International Inter-American Affairs.” But I was
                    more than ready to go to the field. My problem had been a medical clearance and
                    I was able to talk to the head of the medical division who had treated me when
                    he was a doctor in Bangkok, George Mishtowt, and George said he'd give me a
                    clearance. That was taken care of. I was told that I could be released by the
                    Assistant Secretary and so I went to Sao Paulo's consul general in February of
                    1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is one of the three or four great consulate general
                        in the world as far as importance and clout and size, I guess, for that
                        matter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Yes. As early as the ''50s, the consul general had been given a career
                    minister status which at the time was before career ambassador rank. But Senator
                    Fulbright subsequently objected to the concept of having career ministers in
                    Hong Kong and Sao Paulo and a few other places and, as a result, not my
                    predecessor but the predecessor once removed was the last officer to have career
                    minister status.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the city and state of Sao Paulo had grown enormously. People don't
                    realize what a metropolis it is including the satellite cities that already had
                    a population of 12 million. The consular district had a population over 35
                    million at the time and the state of Sao Paulo alone represents 60% of the
                    industrial production of Brazil and 25% of the agricultural production. It's the
                    banking center and had overtaken Rio in that respect years before I arrived. It
                    also publishes the two most important papers, O Estado de Sao Paulo, which is
                    like New York Times, and Foya de Sao Paulo, which has the largest circulation
                    and has very good commercial news. There is a paper like the Wall Street
                    Journal, an edition called Gazette Americantile and the two weekly news
                    magazines, Vesia, and—the other one will come to mind. Anyway, [they are] like
                    Time and Newsweek and are both published in Sao Paulo. It has many facets.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>At the time, 1972, Brazil was in full scale expansion and we were just tapering
                    off our economic aid program and loans were flowing in from the international
                    lending organizations, the IBRD and the IDB, the Inter-American bank. There were
                    500 American companies doing business in Sao Paulo city with plants, of course,
                    located not only in the city but outside. They were opening new plants at at
                    least the rate of once a month.</p>
                <p>The primary function of the consulate general was commercial. This had not always
                    been the case. In 1940, for example, the consulate was not as important as the
                    consulate we had in Santos because all the coffee for the United States was
                    going through the port of Santos and that's where all the steamers docked and
                    you went up by railroad. Very few people traveled by air in 1940. In 1940,
                    Santos had been the principal consulate with those consular invoices on all the
                    exports. Well, by 1972, the consulate at Santos had long since disappeared and
                    the commercial center was manufacturing and American firms were there. Ford and
                    Chrysler had big manufacturing plants and all of the companies that made parts
                    for the automobile industry as well as major chemical companies. There was a big
                    petro-chemical development at Cubatao around the refinery. There was also a
                    government owned steel mill. So the principal task was commercial.</p>
                <p>The Department of Commerce had had a requirement until several years before I
                    went down there of developing an annual list of American firms, but they
                    abandoned that and the result was that we had, as a consulate general, lost
                    contact with a considerable number of American firms. One of the reasons was
                    that the multi-national firms were moving from American managers to Brazilian
                    managers and third-country managers. When I first got there in 1972 it was about
                    divided and senior management about l/3, l/3, l/3. But of course, over the six
                    years that I was there many more Brazilians became top managers and there were
                    quite a number of third-country nationals who headed operations.</p>
                <p>These managers sometimes met at the American Chamber of Commerce but not always.
                    Many of them were not members of the Chamber as I'll explain. But they did not
                    intersect in social or other circles. They knew their suppliers and they knew
                    their customers and, of course, Sao Paulo was an enormous city. But aside from
                    that, there was very little cross-communication. The American Chamber of
                    Commerce, which had well over 1,000, almost 2,000 members both corporate and
                    private citizens, included anybody who had any kind of commercial interest with
                    the United States and wanted to be a member. Brazilian exporters to the United
                    States and lawyers who had American clients and so on all belonged. The Chamber
                    tended to be dominated by the very big American firms and the smaller firms
                    would sometimes come to the monthly luncheons but did not tend to be active in
                    the working of the Chamber. Many American firms simply decided they couldn't be
                    bothered to join.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>We developed this list of American firms by doing research through the telephone
                    books and commercial associations and what not and, after a couple of years, I
                    was able to go into the Executive Committee of the American Chamber on which I
                    sat as honorary President of the Chamber and give them 3 notebooks full of names
                    of companies that were not members.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Incidentally, was it called the American Chamber of
                        Commerce?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: The American Chamber of Commerce, Sao Paulo Branch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It didn't irritate the Brazilians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: No, it was known as the AmCham and all of the economic cabinet ministers
                    would come down from Brasilia and use the AmCham luncheons as sounding boards
                    for many of their major pronouncements. Of course, the ambassador would come
                    down periodically every six months or so, and address the Chamber and set forth
                    American economic or financial policy and Secretaries of the Treasury, on their
                    visits to Brazil came to Sao Paulo and gave luncheon addresses. Secretary
                    Connolly came the first year I was there and I had to rush the whole family down
                    in June so that we would be there in time for the Secretary's visit.</p>
                <p>Earlier that same year Governor Jimmy Carter and his wife had come down in a
                    special aircraft to establish a Georgia trade office in Sao Paulo and that
                    continued for many years. So one of my first tasks was to give a dinner for
                    Governor Carter from which, at the last minute, many of his Georgians bowed out
                    causing considerable disarrangement especially as my wife wasn't there to help
                    cope. But two of the wives of junior officers were very gallant and stepped into
                    the breach. One of them is a Vice President of Garfinckel's now today.</p>
                <p>I took Governor Carter around to meet the prominent people. He addressed the
                    state legislature and, of course, called on the Governor and various heads of
                    trade associations and people he was interested in. Aside from that, he was very
                    active personally with the local Baptist Church.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had an early in with the new Administration in a
                        sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Not really. I was able to take the Governor around. I was very impressed
                    by him. We were speaking about these roundtables that we had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First, you had just finished up on Governor Carter. Go
                        ahead with the roundtables.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>CHAPIN: The roundtables we had every two weeks in principle and, as I said, we
                    had a cross-section of American companies and usually a lawyer, a member of one
                    of the big 8 accounting firms, and a bank representative. So we had three good
                    experts and everybody was encouraged to talk about his or her company. It was
                    mostly male executives [discussing] how they were doing, how their industry was
                    doing, and what their problems were. As the Brazilian economy began to encounter
                    some troubles, more and more import restrictions were imposed and import
                    substitution was encouraged. On more than one occasion we had American companies
                    who said, “We're having difficulty importing (in one case) glass syringes for
                    these hypodermic needles that we sell.” One of the people sitting around said,
                    “Well, we have a patent to produce those in Brazil but we didn't find a market.
                    Let's talk about it after the session.” Another case, a manufacturer said, “Our
                    real problem in manufacturing is the new plants that we've got. We need better
                    dust collectors.” One of the fellows piped up and said, “Well, we're not
                    manufacturing them here at the moment but we do manufacture them elsewhere and
                    let's get together.” So these served to bring people together as I
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>There was little contact between the three different types of managers, the
                    Brazilians, the third-country nationals and the Americans. And so the lunches
                    that were financed by the corporations and for which they earned brownie points
                    with their headquarters was also an opportunity to bring these people together
                    socially and for them to get to know one another and deal informally and
                    exchange opinions. These roundtables also served as a locus for corporations to
                    bring their senior management, who were often coming down for a plant opening or
                    to see how the company with its extraordinary profits was doing.</p>
                <p>One small American firm privately owned came down and made an investment of $l
                    million. It had exactly one product—to seal glass to aluminum frames. Of course,
                    there was a huge construction boom in Sao Paulo. In the first year they made $l
                    million in profit, exactly what their investment was. So there were
                    extraordinary profits and corporate management was frequently coming down and
                    banks were holding their annual meetings. David Rockefeller came down twice and
                    the Bank of America, Jim Claussen, and Morgan Guarantee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did First Boston have an office there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Not only did First Boston have an office there, they had a bank. Not
                    First Boston, Bank of Boston.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Bank of Boston.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Bank of Boston had a big bank which did very well and we often had
                    economists from that bank come to our sessions.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>In the first years Brazil was such a market that one of the few things that I was
                    able to bring with me when I went down in February 1972 was the concept that the
                    United States was going to open a regional trade center in Sao Paulo. Not only
                    for Brazil but we hoped to attract people from Uruguay and Argentina and to a
                    lesser extent Paraguay. But in usual U. S. government style the budgets kept
                    being cut and Commerce Department for several years was unable to fund this
                    while sending down senior officers to assure everybody that, yes, indeed we were
                    going to have a trade center which we eventually did open. It lasted there for a
                    number of years and lasted all during the time of the remaining years that I was
                    there. It was a showcase and was a very good source of sales and U. S.
                    participation in Brazilian trade fairs which were concentrated largely in Sao
                    Paulo were also very rewarding to the American exhibitors. Either the ambassador
                    or I would open these trade fairs depending on his schedule and we had a lot of
                    business supporting those participants.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned, there was a big publishing center in Sao Paulo and USIS was busy
                    placing material with these papers. I maintained relations with some of the
                    people, notably the publishers, particularly the two brothers who published O
                    Estado. I was able to get them into the residence of the consul general for the
                    first time in history to meet with our ambassador. We did have some interchange.
                    But they were mostly interested in international aspects of American policy and,
                    while I did receive a number of policy briefing telegrams, I was not cut into
                    the vast mass of telegrams on non-Brazilian and non-Latin American matters and
                    certainly not on a timely basis. I received all the general, a lot of mail stuff
                    which was very appropriate but was not the kind of thing that a major newspaper
                    was interested in. So I was always behind the ball and they had very good
                    informants and correspondents around the world. There was a limited role with
                    the publications aside from the appropriate role that USIS posed.</p>
                <p>I also did have to take over the responsibility in improving the management of
                    the consular section because we were not getting any additional personnel and we
                    were receiving enormous increase in non-immigrant visa applicants. Then we had
                    files of some 20,000-25,000 American citizens who, at one time or another, had
                    registered with us and there was a difficult security situation. In the
                    beginning there was urban terrorism in Sao Paulo much like the Tupamaros on a
                    vaster proportioned scale in Montevideo but, nevertheless, a serious threat and
                    nobody had bothered to cull these files. I instituted a mass action of checking
                    these 20,000 odd cards in order to have up-to-date addresses and weed out the
                    people who long since had left Brazil. We had considerable consular
                    activity.</p>
                <p>The other thing that I did was to travel around the consular district which, as I
                    said, had 35 million people in it and was as large as the United States east of
                    the Mississippi. It originally took in not only the states of Mato Grosso and
                    Parana but also supervisory responsibility over the consul we had down in Porto
                    Alegre and Rio Grande do Sul and the state of Santa Catarina which, he being
                    alone, really never got to.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>The Brazilian government was then a military government but the heart of the
                    opposition to the government parties, the NDB, was in the south in the more
                    urban and developed areas of Brazil. I would travel the interior and visited all
                    the cities over 100,000. There were some 22 when I arrived in the state of Sao
                    Paulo alone. There were some 32 when I left and would make it a point of calling
                    on the mayor and the official party. Then I insisted always on having equal time
                    and trying to see the officially recognized opposition party. Naturally, I
                    didn't deal with the communists but the officially recognized opposition party I
                    did try to see on every occasion. It was not possible in the beginning when I
                    made my first trips around Sao Paulo state to find anybody who acknowledged that
                    they were the organized leaders of the opposition party. But eventually the word
                    got out and in subsequent years I did meet with people and those individuals
                    became mayors of the cities and then some of them became governors of their
                    states and senators. In fact, the governor of Sao Paulo is a man I first met
                    when he was mayor of Campinas and everybody said he wasn't going anywhere and
                    then he became senator and then governor and there's a possible presidential
                    candidate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the system then? Did you report back to Rio or
                        Brasilia or did you report directly to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: It depended on the ambassador and the pressure from various sides and his
                    establishment at the embassy. The theory initially was that we could report to
                    Washington directly on any matters concerning my consular district so that the
                    Sao Paulo reaction to this or that went directly to Washington. We didn't always
                    report by telegram but sometimes by airgram but directly to Washington.
                    Obviously any policy suggestions had to go through the embassy and we were very
                    careful to steer away from . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You sent them dropped copies, I suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Oh, yes. They got immediate copies of the telegrams and then the section
                    heads from the embassy came down all the time to Sao Paulo, the political
                    counselor, and particularly the treasury attach� to deal with the various banks,
                    and the economic counselor. We did have for several years the commercial attach�
                    in Sao Paulo reporting to me and to the ambassador [for] the labor work. While
                    there was a labor attach� in Brasilia, the trade unions and the day-to-day
                    contact was through the labor officer that I had on my staff because that was
                    where the bulk of the trade union was. Then at various times we had to feed
                    everything but the simplest sort of thing out in political matters through
                    Embassy Brasilia. Obviously on commercial matters and some economic matters we
                    reported directly.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Now, there was an agricultural attach� in Brasilia—the U. S. Department of
                    Agriculture maintained two offices in Sao Paulo—who did a lot of crop reporting
                    and they did that directly to Washington on their own hook. We also had some
                    debate over coffee reporting because there was a national employee in Rio who
                    continued to do the coffee reporting and the coffee was all grown down in the
                    Sao Paulo consular district and he never bothered to check in with the consulate
                    general in any form. The export trade, of course, was in Santos and there were,
                    as far as the growers were concerned, some associations in Londrina, the second
                    largest city of the state of Parana. I had my regular contacts and would report
                    directly to Washington and to Brasilia on what my contacts said. I didn't
                    elaborate beyond that but I would go and interview them periodically and what
                    they had to say was often at marked variance with what the national employee was
                    avoiding from Rio. This led to some concern. I wrote a scathing indictment of
                    the reporting by the Department of Agriculture which I sent to Brasilia pointing
                    out many inaccuracies in their reporting and this caused a big brouhaha. The
                    Assistant Secretary for economic affairs in Washington, E. Bea, had a fellow
                    named Carlisle assigned to look into this coffee matter because accuracy in
                    coffee reporting. We were an important importer and an important member of the
                    International Coffee Agreement. I thought it did matter that all views and not
                    just the selected views gathered by a Brazilian national employee whose sources
                    in my own consular district I knew nothing about. He would never pay me the
                    courtesy of stopping by to see me to arrange his visits. In fact, often he
                    didn't give any advance notice of his travel which was totally improper. I was
                    anxious that all views be known to the United States government and I did
                    represent the United States at the annual Guadojob International Coffee
                    Conferences and had to know what was going on.</p>
                <p>Political reporting, particularly developing contacts with the opposition took an
                    important part of my time. I would say, out of a year on various trips because I
                    had to go north and south and then there was the state of Sao Paulo itself which
                    is as big as West Germany, I would say that I was away on the average of about
                    six weeks of the year. But I did tend to concentrate my travel in the years in
                    which there were elections either local elections or national elections and
                    provide the embassy with a feel as we saw it from the countryside. We were able
                    to maintain better relations with the president of the opposition party who came
                    from Sao Paulo and who would come to lunch regularly while the embassy would
                    only see him every now and then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time had you added Portuguese to your list of
                        languages?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>CHAPIN: Yes, they gave me an intense course at the State Department which they
                    had to convert Spanish into Portuguese. In fact, one of the great utilities from
                    my point while I started traveling almost immediately upon my arrival and before
                    Cornelia came down was that in the interior I was forced to speak Portuguese. I
                    spoke initially a Portunole mixture of Portuguese and Spanish but that goes down
                    to the fact there were people prominent in the Sao Paulo Chamber, AmCham, who
                    were of Argentine birth and they never spoke anything except Spanish with about
                    200 words of Portuguese mixed in. I didn't have any problem with the Argentine
                    Spanish but the Brazilians didn't have any problem with people talking Spanish.
                    It was the Spanish speakers who had a great deal of difficulty understanding the
                    Portuguese speakers on the whole. But, yes, and then I took lessons for a while
                    in Portuguese at the consulate general until we ran out of money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then eventually all good things must come to an end.
                        You've already covered pretty well your time in Ethiopia. How did you get
                        picked out for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Well, by a series of curious circumstances unlike somebody in trances as
                    I think they say in the “Mikado,” the Lord High Executioner. I had been
                    considered, my friends told me in Personnel, for various chiefs of Mission posts
                    for about a year and a half and I was going crazy. They would all go up to the
                    Under Secretary for Political Affairs, Habib, and he would every time cross off
                    my name saying he never met me, he didn't know who I was. So an elaborate scheme
                    was conducted by which Personnel brought me up to be in charge of a promotion
                    panel for senior secretaries and the whole purpose of that was to arrange an
                    appointment for me to meet Habib. I went in to see him in the old office that I
                    knew so well where Harriman had held forth and we had a five minute conversation
                    about absolutely nothing. I can't remember to this day. And, at the end he said,
                    “That's fine. You can have the AID job.” Personnel at the moment was cooking on
                    the issue of an ambassador to Ethiopia but it wasn't at all certain that we were
                    going to have one and we had been without one for a year and a half and the
                    human rights problems were very much to the fore. The whole question of
                    compensation for American nationalized properties is much less so, as well as
                    there were military claims which everybody was very confused about and remained
                    confused for quite a while after I arrived in Ethiopia.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>They first offered the job to my cousin, Roger Kirk, and then they suddenly
                    remembered that he'd been ambassador to Somalia and that that wasn't going to be
                    a very good selection. And so I was kicking about and they said would I like to
                    go to Ethiopia and I said, “Sure, I'd be happy to go anywhere.” I went on back
                    to Sao Paulo, this was in the fall of 1977, then we went off for Christmas
                    vacation off in the mountains up in Ninashireyes. In order for a consular
                    general to be on vacation, of course, you've got to get out of your consular
                    district because, otherwise, you're technically in charge wherever you are and
                    subject to instant recall. When Senator Javits came down suddenly, even though I
                    was in the neighboring state of Rio de Janeiro, I was yanked back and so the
                    idea was to get as far away in the mountains as possible and not have to be
                    recalled. So we were having lunch on Christmas Eve and the phone rang and it was
                    Dick Moose who was Assistant Secretary for African Affairs and he said, “Would
                    you like to be ambassador to Ethiopia?” I said, “Yes, sure. What shall I do?
                    Shall I pack my bags and go on back to Sao Paulo? When do you want to see me?
                    When should I start briefing?” He said, “Well, you know, relations are very
                    tenuous and we don't know for sure whether this thing is going to develop. Stan
                    Patton will let you know.” Well, the first thing that happened was early in
                    January I got this pound of papers that I should fill out as ambassador. I
                    filled that out rapidly and sent that in and then I waited for a couple of
                    months. Word sort of began to leak that I was leaving and the Governor whom I
                    kept meeting was an old, not an old friend but mutual friends, kept saying,
                    “Well, but you don't go.” Meanwhile, I'd gone up to Washington for a conference
                    to brief ambassadors going into the field and ambassadors designate and we went
                    everywhere including the CIA safe houses and all that sort of thing. I came back
                    to Sao Paulo and I sat around and waited some more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was quite a trip to take for a little briefing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: No, it was a ten-day, two-week course that they did for the ambassadorial
                    course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, this was what Dave Robb was running?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Well, they instituted it, I guess, at his time or shortly thereafter but
                    it was about 10 days, 2 weeks of being talked at and then traveling around to
                    various places. Finally, there was a decision to that we were going to have an
                    ambassador and, in fact, it was only toward the end of May that I came up to
                    Washington for the briefings to begin.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>It was July when we went to Addis. But it was touch and go during this whole
                    period. Mengistu would make very anti-American speeches and Secretary Vance
                    testified to Congress that the Ethiopians were causing a great deal of
                    difficulty in the Horn of Africa and there was a nasty reaction from Ethiopians
                    and so we sent a special delegation from the NSC and the Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary for African Affairs out to talk to Mengistu. Matters were in constant
                    flux and, as I say, the Treasury Department, as I told you before this interview
                    began, wanted to invoke the Gonzalez Amendment, which it had full authority to
                    do, which was to vote “no” on an international loan to Ethiopia. The Gonzalez
                    Amendment had been patterned after the Hickenlooper Amendment. No vote was
                    required if a country failed to take appropriate steps to compensate American
                    persons, private and corporate, whose property had been nationalized and, for
                    four years, the Ethiopian government had been unwilling to do anything or enter
                    into any meaningful negotiation. And if Treasury invoked the Gonzalez Amendment
                    which it had full authority to do although there was an inter-agency committee,
                    this triggered the Hickenlooper Amendment which, in fact, terminated economic
                    assistance as opposed to humanitarian assistance to a country. It was very
                    difficult once it was invoked to remove unless there was really a settlement of
                    nationalization claims which, in the case of Ethiopia, until December of 1985
                    although on the terms I was advocating back in 1978 and early 1979. So that's
                    how I got to Ethiopia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the immediate circumstances to your leaving
                        Ethiopia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Well, there were a number of high crimes and misdemeanors on my part
                    which were alleged by the Ethiopian government but my official conduct was
                    defended publicly by the U. S. Government and I was well received in Washington
                    on my return about the 15th of August, 1980. It was very late in the Carter
                    Administration and I was informed that the only job which was available for me
                    was a newly created job as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Latin
                    America. The new job in Defense Department was important because there was a
                    state of undeclared war between the Departments of Defense and State over Latin
                    American policy. The Defense Department was far more hawkish than the Bureau of
                    Inter-American Affairs led by my friend, Bill Bowdler. On the other hand the man
                    for whom I was going to be working in Defense, Dave McGiffert, was a man I'd
                    known since college days and had seen off and on in Maine over the intervening
                    years. He was a brilliant lawyer who worked for one of the best law firms in
                    Washington before he took on the job in Defense and was extremely able and
                    knowledgeable in the field of international security affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>It was only going to be a short-term assignment because it was most likely that
                    the Reagan Administration would want to make its own appointments. Nevertheless,
                    it was not always certain that career officers would be replaced at the Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary level. I reported for work in September and soon found that,
                    while I had a marvelous title, there was very little for me to do as there was
                    an excellent staff of military officers quite senior. In fact, my deputy was a
                    brigadier general soon promoted to major general who ran the entire staff. I was
                    allowed, however, to handle relations between Departments and was able to bring
                    about a good understanding between the Pentagon, both sides of the Pentagon,
                    both ISA and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the State Department.</p>
                <p>One of the ways I was able to do this was that the Department of Defense had
                    earlier commissioned a strategic study of American interests and priorities in
                    Latin America by Margaret Daley-Hayes who later worked on Capitol Hill. Miss
                    Hayes had developed a very convincing schedule of priorities or interests which
                    I was able to incorporate into all of the planning documents up to five years
                    with the agreement of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and ISA and the wholehearted
                    support of the Department of State. For the first time in many years the
                    Department of Defense had a comprehensive and consistent series of policy
                    documents with regard to our activities in Latin America.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This applies to all of Latin America or just Central
                        America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: This applied to all of Latin America. The other things that we were doing
                    were to attempt to simplify the command structure on the military side in the
                    Western hemisphere. Naval matters beyond the low-water mark in the hemisphere
                    are the purview of the Commander-in-Chief Atlantic, CINCLANT, who is assigned to
                    Norfolk and who is the Supreme Allied Commander for Naval Forces under NATO
                    whereas the military assistance groups and all land matters were either purview
                    of the combined command, USCINCSOUTH in Panama. However, with the ratification
                    of the Panama Canal Treaties, the role of USCINCSOUTH should have been examined
                    in greater detail and was beginning to be examined by the Defense Department.
                    Our conclusion was that the command in Panama should be restricted to those
                    elements consistent with the Panama Canal Treaties which dealt with the defense
                    of the Canal and other ancillary tasks involving the supervision of the various
                    military assistance missions and the operation of the schools which had been in
                    Panama for years and which had trained a large number of Latin American officers
                    and, in some cases, technicians, should be moved from Panama or we should, by
                    treaty, obtain extensions of the limited period for those schools to continue
                    set forth in the Panama Canal Treaties.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Thus, I proposed that our popular ambassador in Panama be authorized under
                    Circular 175 to begin negotiations with President Torrijos because I didn't
                    believe that we would be likely to find a future president of Panama who would
                    be as easy to negotiate with as Torrijos although there were many problems in
                    negotiating with him. This came as an enormous shock to the entire Pentagon
                    bureaucracy who never heard of the authorization for negotiating a treaty in the
                    Circular 175 and, certainly, that it was totally inappropriate for an ambassador
                    representing State Department—they overlooked the fact that he represented the
                    President—for a representative of the State Department to negotiate on matters
                    of U. S. military schools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But certainly most of the base agreements in history have
                        been negotiated by ambassadors.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Well, they have been negotiated largely by military teams but the concept
                    of requesting approval formally was alien to everyone that I met with, and
                    particularly the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to my great surprise. We were never
                    successful before my departure in getting approval of those negotiations and
                    with the end of the Carter Administration the whole issue lapsed. We also
                    attempted to eliminate the command which had been established under President
                    Carter's Administration at Key West which was totally superfluous and had
                    technically a planning role for the Caribbean.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this an Army command, a Navy command or a Joint
                        command?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: This was a Joint command. General DeCamp and I toured the various
                    commands—CINCLANT at Norfolk, the command at Key West, and the U. S. Navy
                    command at Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico as well as the base at Guantanamo and
                    USCINCSOUTH at Panama—and carefully reviewed this accompanied by a
                    representative of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who agreed with us that the Key West
                    command was totally unnecessary and that the authority of the command in Panama
                    should be reduced. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, however, opposed the concept
                    vehemently and, while we made considerable progress in getting our
                    recommendations through the civilian side of the Defense Department, we did not
                    obtain Secretary Brown's final approval before he left office in early January
                    of 1981. But it was an interesting 3-1/2 months that I had in the Pentagon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel, generally, that it was a successful idea to
                        have cross-fertilization? They equally had military men in some branches of
                        the State Department including the planning staff, politico-military
                        section. Did you feel that had a future to it at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>CHAPIN: I felt that it was an important assignment but that there was a limited
                    ambit for me personally. So much of the day-to-day work was being done by these
                    very competent officers assigned to me and that it was only in certain specific
                    projects which I've just mentioned and which were highly sensitive that an
                    outsider could display initiative and provide another view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then just about at the beginning of the new
                        administration was the time when you were called on to go to El
                        Salvador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Yes, it came about in a very curious way. Prime Minister Seaga from
                    Jamaica came to the United States in the very early days of the Reagan
                    Administration and was received officially here in Washington. There was a
                    reception for him at the State Department to which I was invited in my Defense
                    Department capacity and there I ran into Deputy Secretary Stoessel who asked
                    whether I was enjoying my job at the Defense Department. I told him I was
                    frankly bored because General DeCamp and his associates were doing most of the
                    work. Two days later I received a call saying that Secretary Haig wanted me to
                    go directly to El Salvador to take over in the first days of February of 1981
                    from Robert White who had been summarily recalled by the Administration for
                    having too liberal views for the incoming Administration. He had held some press
                    conferences but it was the tenor of his reports and views which made him
                    unacceptable even had he maintained those privately. I went to see Secretary
                    Haig immediately and he asked me to get there right away. I persuaded him that I
                    had to wait a few days because Mrs. White was still at the residence and packing
                    out and the only place I could stay for security reasons was at the embassy
                    residence. The Secretary, in the meeting that we had, outlined very extensively
                    my priority tasks in El Salvador and furnished me with a letter which I was to
                    take to the President of the Junta, Jose Napoleon Duarte. These instructions
                    were comprehensive for virtually my entire stay in El Salvador.</p>
                <p>Initially the stay was to be only a month and a half, but it was extended to
                    almost four months because of the inevitable delays in confirming the ambassador
                    who had been selected, Dean Hinton. I was always regarded as simply an interim
                    senior officer sent to hold the fort until Dean Hinton could arrive and not
                    needing confirmation, but the Administration was anxious that this be viewed as
                    a high-level assignment and so I was described to the press as Deputy
                    Ambassador, a job which only existed in Saigon, I believe, during part of our
                    war days in Vietnam. The Latin Americans, however, understood the concept of a
                    charg� d'affaires with the rank of ambassador and I was very well received by
                    President Duarte and all the members of the government including the military
                    high command.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was an interesting and rather difficult thing to get
                        over in the beginning, the concept, I can certainly see that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>CHAPIN: Once arrived in El Salvador the press of business was so great that there
                    wasn't any time to worry about the niceties. I was told to re-examine and make
                    recommendations about the size and scope of both the military and economic
                    assistance programs and also a possible program to interdict the fall of arms
                    into El Salvador across the Gulf of Fonseca from Nicaragua and, indirectly by
                    air, either across the Gulf or over Honduran territory. The latter proved to be
                    an almost insoluble problem given the geography and the mountains and
                    mountainless islands in the Gulf of Fonseca so that we had to concentrate
                    primarily on increasing the military assistance and economic assistance. It
                    proved easier to increase the military assistance program although not to the
                    levels which would be attained in subsequent years.</p>
                <p>The fiscal year was already well under way by the early days of February and
                    re-programming of AID programs is extremely difficult as I know from my
                    experience as Executive Secretary at the AID agency. We were able to get half of
                    what we recommended but we kept up the battle until I left on May 26 and Dean
                    Hinton continued to advocate greatly increased military and economic assistance
                    on which he was successful as the years went by.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the timing of the election? At the time you went
                        there Duarte had still not been elected. He was just the head of Junta.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: As there was a Junta which was composed of two members of the Christian
                    Democratic Party, one independent and one army officer. In fact, the electoral
                    commission was established shortly after I arrived and electoral laws and the
                    whole process had to be started. One of my tasks was to push along that process
                    in which I was successful and early on I received assurances from the military
                    high command that they would endorse free and fair elections as well as
                    international observers from the OAS and other organizations.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Two other priority matters which I had to attend to were the prosecution of the
                    cases against the unknown murderers of the four American church women who were
                    killed in December and the two American land reform experts who were murdered in
                    the Sheraton Hotel dining room in early January of 1981. First of all, we had to
                    find some clues or some evidence which would lead us to the murderers. We
                    suspected and had some indications that the persons who had perpetrated both
                    crimes were part of the military either on active duty or off-duty. It was the
                    off-duty security service members who constituted the so-called Death Squad.
                    And, we rather suspected a death squad in the case of the land reform experts
                    and uniformed, probably National Guard members, in the case of the church
                    women's murder. But there was virtually no evidence available. Fortunately, with
                    regard to the church women's case, we eventually developed a “Deep Throat”
                    source in the Salvadoran army who gave us the names of the six persons of the
                    National Guard who had been on duty at the airport at El Salvador the night that
                    two of the church women arrived from Managua and were met by two other church
                    women who were working in El Salvador. With this specific information, I was
                    eventually able to get the Minister of Defense to arrest the six individuals and
                    confiscate their weapons and take their fingerprints. Once the weapons were in
                    hand and the fingerprint charts available, we sent this evidence to Washington
                    to the FBI laboratories where the weapons were used in ballistic tests to
                    compare the results with spent bullets which had been found at the initial grave
                    site of the four murdered church women. The only fingerprint which was found on
                    the vehicle in which the church women had been traveling proved to be the thumb
                    print of the commander of the detachment of the National Guard at the airport
                    that night and one of the weapons of the other members of the detachment proved
                    by ballistic tests to have been identical with the weapon used in shooting one
                    of the church women.</p>
                <p>In the case of the two land reform experts we were equally lucky. One morning the
                    Defense Attach� was having breakfast at the Sheraton Hotel with one of his
                    military contacts when one of the waitresses who had befriended a member of the
                    American Military Assistance group said to this young soldier that the person
                    having breakfast with the U. S. military attach� was one of the persons who had
                    been present the night the two land reform experts had been murdered in the
                    hotel dining room. The waitress in question was the person who had served the
                    American experts and their Salvadoran contact and had been a witness to part of
                    the whole scenario. The details are rather complex, but with her testimony we
                    were able to make some progress. None of the principals of the case, that is the
                    intellectual decision-makers, were ever convicted. But the two off-duty members
                    of the National Guard who were summoned to the hotel by Lieutenant Lopez Sibrian
                    and who actually carried out the murders were eventually tried and convicted
                    although they were amnestied by general political amnesty shortly after they
                    were jailed in El Salvador. The ultimate results were not satisfactory to the
                    United States, but during my time, during the three and a half months, I was
                    able to advance the land reform case with the invaluable assistance of a former
                    FBI expert hired by the American Institute of Free Labor, AIFL. In the case of
                    the church women, the action of the Minister of Defense represented the first
                    time in Salvadoran history that any member of the armed forces was ever arrested
                    or detained for any human rights violation or any major crime of a non-military
                    nature.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been an extremely delicate job presenting
                        this evidence to the government. How did you go about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Well, there were a series of meetings with President Duarte and he was
                    most cooperative. It was he who had instructed the Attorney General to dig up
                    the original burial site and find the ballistic evidence which linked eventually
                    one of the members of the detail at the airport with the crime. It was more
                    complicated to deal with the Vice President of the Junta, Colonel Gutierrez, who
                    was a defender quite naturally of the interests of the armed forces. Colonel
                    Garcia, the Minister of Defense, was a very rational person who took very
                    seriously the evidence of military involvement in both crimes and was most
                    cooperative in making the arrest — or it was really initially not an arrest but
                    detention of the members of the National Guard detail at the airport. The most
                    delicate problem was getting the Minister of Defense to assume responsibility
                    for the arrest and go public with it. I could have covered myself with a great
                    deal of glory by announcing that the Salvadoran government had arrested the
                    persons responsible for the church women's murder, but I insisted that I would
                    not do so and that the Salvadoran government had to make the announcement
                    itself. When Minister Garcia finally made the announcement, he attributed the
                    information on the basis of which they were detained to international agencies
                    and totally omitted the U. S. role which was perfectly acceptable to me and
                    extremely sensible. But it is not something which has enhanced my public image,
                    but I nevertheless believed it was the right course of action.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Credit is a great thing to have but it doesn't always win
                        the battle. So were there any other major things that you dealt with while
                        there? You've already done 4-1/2 months' work, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>CHAPIN: Well, there were revisions of the assistance programs, as I mentioned.
                    There was pushing the electoral process forward. There was the advancement of
                    the two American human rights cases. And, there was one other instruction which
                    I had which was to nurture or foster a broader government in El Salvador and I
                    worked very hard at this and had some initial success with the business
                    community and with the trade union federation. But the negotiations between them
                    broke down and the Christian Democrats were not very receptive to additional
                    support from what might be viewed as the democratic left and the rather moderate
                    to conservative right. Dean Hinton continued those efforts but as we compared
                    notes in subsequent years, neither of us was really successful in broadening the
                    political base of the coalition. This, however, is not an unusual fact as far as
                    Christian Democrats in Latin America are concerned. Frei and the Chilean
                    Christian Democrats only ever solicited the support of another political party
                    on any issue during President Frei's tenure in Chile. On one occasion, and that
                    was to pass a national wage law, the party whose support they sought was the
                    equally autocratic Communist Party of Chile. The Christian Democrats in Latin
                    America are autocrats, they are not really democrats so that there is a lot of
                    puffery which has gone on with regard to the Christian Democratic government of
                    El Salvador and also a lot of excessive euphoria with regard to the Christian
                    Democrat President of Guatemala today, Vinicio Serrano. Serrano was elected in
                    free and fair elections but this does not mean that he does not owe his
                    continuance in office to the full scale support of the military which have
                    always dominated Guatemalan life. Serrano is not a real democrat but a practical
                    politician who is prepared to deal with the facts of life as he finds them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any non-Marxist, non-communist, socialist
                        parties in Central America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Well, in Salvador there are some minuscule parties represented by Ruben
                    Zamora who split off from the Christian Democrats and by Ungo who represents the
                    Social Democrats. But those parties are described as being van parties. The
                    critics maintain that all of their members would fit in one Volkswagen van. The
                    recent results of the presidential elections confirm that there are only very
                    small minorities of people in Salvador who support these left-wing parties. One
                    of the efforts that I made was to see that these parties were specifically
                    included in the original elections laws which were developed during the early
                    days that I was in Salvador.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>There's one final chapter which has to do with land reform in El Salvador and the
                    United States spent hundreds of millions of dollars attempting to support Phase
                    1 which had to do with the nationalization of the largest properties in Salvador
                    and their conversion into cooperatives and then a program called Phase 3 which
                    would give properties that were being leased or sharecropped by farmers at the
                    time of the nationalization of the larger properties to the sharecroppers or
                    tenants and the owners of the properties would be compensated. But this was for
                    the small scale tenants and sharecroppers up to 17 acres. The program eventually
                    benefited some 400,000 people in Salvador but was not as extensive as had been
                    originally hoped. The program was developed by American experts who had been
                    active in land reform programs in Taiwan and Japan and was of limited success.
                    Phase 2, however, which was to be the nationalization of intermediate size
                    programs was not carried through. I was a strong advocate for not continuing
                    with Phase 2 because it would disturb the agricultural production of El Salvador
                    and vastly increased the amounts of balance of payment support and other support
                    for the Salvadoran economy which the United States would have to provide.
                    President Duarte himself was very clear on some of the limitations of the land
                    reform program which was strongly advocated by his own party. Clarence Long, the
                    Democratic Congressman from Maryland, came down to Salvador early in 1981 and
                    had a very frank series of exchanges with President Duarte about Phase 1 of the
                    agricultural reform. Congressman Long was very critical of the establishment of
                    these large scale cooperatives and advocated that the land rather be distributed
                    to individual peasants. Duarte, on the other hand, pointed out that if the
                    Salvadoran government were to do so, the peasants would simply plant subsistence
                    crops, corn and beans, and would eradicate the coffee bushes, would stop
                    planting cotton and sugar, and the country would have not only no cash crops but
                    very few exports so that the effort was made to improve the lot of the peasants
                    through the creation of cooperatives. Administratively, however, the persons
                    appointed to run these cooperatives proved to be largely failures and many of
                    the cooperatives had to be abandoned progressively or were destroyed in the
                    process of military operations.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned earlier, we poured and continue to pour as far as I know still are
                    pouring hundreds of millions of dollars of economic assistance to attempt to
                    make the agricultural program, largely the land reform program, work.
                    Fortunately, Phase 2 was never really implemented and some of the most serious
                    consequences for the economy thus were avoided. I'm very happy that I was among
                    those who strongly advocated the formal notification to the Salvadoran
                    government that the United States government could not support financially the
                    implementation of Phase 2.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now let's go into the transition from Acting Ambassador to
                        confirmed ambassador. How did this work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>CHAPIN: Well, I was offered a variety of choices, none of them particularly
                    appealing, the best of which was ambassador to Guatemala. Secretary Haig had
                    told me in January when I agreed to go to Salvador that upon completion of my
                    service I would be taken care of. But the kinds of places that the Department
                    seemed to have in mind for me were: the high altitude post of Bolivia where
                    there was an intractable drug problem which to this date has never been
                    solved—in those days we were not pursuing it actively); Beirut, where war raged
                    and continues to rage; and Liberia, where there had just been a coup. Of the
                    various choices, Guatemala seemed to be the one which I thought would be the
                    most appealing to members of my family and, while it offered a deteriorating
                    situation and an inhospitable government with which we had had very limited
                    relationships, nevertheless I was willing to take it on. We had not had an
                    ambassador for over a year and we had a . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By that time it was 15 years since Gordon Mine had been
                        killed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Yes. It had been some time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that wasn't a problem at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: No, but the insurgency was increasing. There had been some improvement in
                    the interim but insurgency was increasing and there were murders on the street
                    of Guatemala City as well as massacres in the Indian populated mountain areas.
                    The United States had very limited programs in Guatemala. Guatemala had
                    renounced U. S. military assistance in 1977 because of the attitude of the
                    United States toward human rights violations in Guatemala and, despite major
                    efforts, even a cash sale program was not effectively revived in Guatemala
                    before I left in March of 1984.</p>
                <p>On the economic side, also because of human rights violations, the United States
                    was simply providing assistance to the poorest of the poor. This was a category
                    of really humanitarian assistance rather than developmental assistance. It
                    represented authorizations including PL 480 surplus agricultural products of
                    about $9 million a year for a population of some 8 to 9 million people. But
                    actual disbursements from 1978 through 1981 only averaged $3.5 million which is
                    absolutely nothing in economic and macro-economic terms. In fact, the benefit
                    that Guatemala received from preferential treatment under the sugar import
                    quotas in the United States exceeded the effective economic assistance which it
                    was receiving for the least advantaged or the most disadvantaged sectors of the
                    population, largely programs in the Indian dominated rural areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go almost immediately to Guatemala or was there an
                        interim period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>CHAPIN: Well, it took a few months for the usual briefings and approval by the
                    Senate so I left Salvador at the end of May and arrived in mid-August 1981 in
                    Guatemala and was there until early 1984, not quite three years. In Guatemala we
                    had problems with regard to the murder of two priests, one of which occurred
                    before my time, and the murder of other American citizens before I arrived, and
                    threats to the American missionaries, notably the Maryknolls. This was not
                    unique as far as American missionaries was concerned. The priests and nuns of
                    the Catholic Church in Guatemala were largely foreigners and they were suspect
                    and many of them had to leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there a lot of Irish or were they Latinos from other
                        parts of . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: No, they were Europeans. They were Belgians, Italians and representatives
                    of various nations but largely not other Latin American priests and nuns.</p>
                <p>We also had a number of problems with Americans who were arrested illegally and
                    charged with crimes that they had not committed of a security nature. One was a
                    young American who was charged with leading a bank of guerrillas even though he
                    spoke only a few words of Spanish and was demonstrably in Panama on the date
                    that the event that he was charged with having committed actually occurred. We
                    had a great deal of difficulty getting him released and his case became involved
                    under the government of General Raosmond in a series of summary executions by
                    firing squad after minimal trials. Fortunately, I was able to bring enough
                    pressure on the Raosmond government so that the American was eventually
                    released. However, I earned the undying enmity of the Minister of Defense, a
                    senior military officer who was over the special military tribunals that had
                    tried the American. That general was to succeed General Raosmond and my
                    relationship with the succeeding government was anything but happy.
                    Nevertheless, I'm happy to say, all the Americans who were detained—peace corps
                    volunteers, visiting protestant ministers, the young American I mentioned, all
                    of them—were released after relatively recent periods of time and none of them
                    were tortured and none of them were killed. Q: Did you have some further
                    detective work to do there, producing evidence for some of these things?</p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Yes, the investigative services in all Central American countries are
                    rudimentary. We had problems with American citizens, but we even had more
                    serious problems with Guatemalans who were employed by an American AID
                    contractor who had a program for the bilingual education of Indians and others
                    in local languages and in Spanish. Many of the Indians in Guatemala, or over
                    half the population, really did not speak Spanish at all and this, of course,
                    excludes them from the central path of Guatemalan life. There are professional
                    anthropologists, many are Americans, who really advocate that the Indians be
                    left alone but, in my view, this is an impractical suggestion in modern times
                    and leads to a continuation of vast discrepancies in income levels and cultural
                    levels between two halves of the population of Guatemala.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it nearly half and half or aren't there more
                        Indians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: There are really more Indians. Of course, there's never been an adequate
                    census so it's very difficult to say what the population is in the mountainous
                    areas. When we talk about free and fair elections, we should remember that,
                    because of the administrative and logistic difficulties, polling booths are not
                    established in the predominantly Indian areas high up in the mountains, and less
                    than a half of the potential voters actually have access to the ballot. It is
                    not like El Salvador where the Indians have been incorporated into national life
                    and polling opportunities are available in all areas except those totally
                    dominated by the guerrillas.</p>
                <p>The Guatemalans who were killed by the Guatemalan government, and in this case
                    specifically by the Guatemalan military, total 8 of whom several were directly
                    employed by an AID contractor and others were family members of those persons so
                    employed or peripherally connected with the bilingual project. We never were
                    able to obtain any kind of apology from the Guatemalan government for these
                    murders and I was, in fact, twice withdrawn as ambassador back to Washington as
                    a protest against the murders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it anti-American or was it something they had been
                        doing extracurricularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: The Guatemalan military have always been suspicious of any efforts to
                    improve the lot of Indians and incorporate them in the society. In the first
                    case, there is some evidence that the AID contract employee was a lawyer had
                    given some advice to some mine workers in the area where he was working the
                    bilingual project and that the mine owner had appealed to the Guatemalan
                    military to take care of the individual concerned. This led to his arrest and to
                    his disappearance and eventually confession by the Guatemalan government had
                    indeed killed the four individuals—the lawyer concerned, the driver of his
                    vehicle, his brother who is tangentially connected with the project, and the
                    mother-in-law of the brother who was hitching a ride in the jeep.</p>
                <p>In the other case, there were two women who were picked up off the streets who
                    were associated with the project and the motive for that arrest is unknown.
                    Subsequently, another member of the project and his wife were detained under
                    unknown circumstances. Three of the bodies turned up in a vehicle in a staged
                    accident in the northern part of Guatemala as part of a scenario that the four
                    had sought to establish contact in Mexico with members of the guerilla
                    opposition. For many reasons we were able to disprove the entire theory and the
                    press and all independent observers in Guatemala concluded on the basis of the
                    evidence which we were able to produce from family members and other sources
                    that the death was not as a result of an automobile accident but rather that the
                    three persons found in the accident, the so-called accident, had been driven to
                    the scene of the accident and an incendiary bomb had then been thrown into the
                    vehicle after they were already dead.</p>

                <p>Again, I did not earn any great credit with the Minister of Defense.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: As a matter of fact, the Minister of Defense who, by that time was Chief
                    of State, Mahia Victoras, made a point of denying to me the standard decoration
                    which is issued to all ambassadors who had been in country over two years. The
                    subsequent and popularly elected president, Venicio Serrano, some four years
                    later in a special ceremony here in the Guatemalan Embassy, awarded me not only
                    the medal which I would have been entitled to but the Grand Cross of the Order
                    of the Kedzal in a special ceremony to make up for this insult.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: August of 1983, yes. Mahia Victoras took over in a relatively bloodless
                    coup in August of 1983 and I was recalled in November of 1983 over the second
                    series of murders and the staged automobile accident which was—no, as a matter
                    of fact, over the second series of arrests. The staged automobile accident was
                    to come later in 1984. I did not return to Guatemala until January of 1984 when
                    I was really returning to be caretaker. The new Assistant Secretary for Latin
                    American Affairs, Tony Motley, had decided that there should be a new
                    ambassador, and a political appointee who had long sought the job, in fact
                    before I was appointed to Guatemala in the first place, was appointed to take my
                    place.</p>

                        carrier the day before the coup. Was that a major story or was it just
                        something accidental?</hi>

                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>CHAPIN: There had been a decision to send a carrier task force to the Pacific
                    coast area off the Pacific coast of Central America for some time. This soon
                    became involved in the command difficulties which I outlined before with regard
                    to U. S. military forces. The task force was, of course, under Navy command and
                    through appropriate military channels an invitation had been issued, that is the
                    Joint Chiefs of Staff, I assume. I was informed of the invitation but was not
                    the conduit for the transmission of the invitation to General Mahia who was the
                    Minister of Defense. He was invited along with the other Ministers of Defense in
                    Central America to go on board the carrier on a weekend and the U. S. Commander
                    CINCSOUTH in Panama had decided that it was a fortuitous opportunity to invite
                    the various Presidents of Central American countries to go out to the carrier on
                    Monday.</p>
                <p>Well, immediately following the visit of the various Ministers of Defense under
                    Navy orders the carrier task force plunged deep into the Pacific and was out of
                    helicopter or plane range (or would be out of plane range) of the Central
                    American coast on Monday morning. I learned of this by chance and protested to
                    Washington on Saturday that it was totally impossible politically to have the
                    Minister of Defense visit the carrier and for me to go and tell the military
                    President of Guatemala, a general, that his visit on Monday was cancelled
                    because of operational considerations. I was able to turn this matter around
                    with a great deal of pressure at the high levels of the State Department and a
                    great deal of bad feeling in the Defense Department, but political
                    considerations finally outweighed operational considerations and the carrier
                    task force was turned around and was back in sufficient distance so that planes
                    from the carrier were on the ground in Guatemala City on Monday morning and I
                    was out at the airport to bid farewell to President Raosmond. When the coup
                    actually occurred the airplanes from the Air Force base where I was were already
                    in the air fully armed and the helicopters were flying over the city.</p>
                <p>The difficulties between President Raosmond and the military had come to the fore
                    about a month earlier and President Raosmond had told Secretary of Agriculture
                    Bloch a few days prior to his prospective visit to the carrier that he had
                    almost been ousted by the military at that time. In fact, Secretary Bloch's
                    entire visit to Guatemala had been designed in early July to show the personal
                    support of President Reagan for President Raosmond. The visit was successful as
                    far as it went but the difficulties within the military, President Raosmond's
                    extensive support for the protestant movement in Guatemala and his difficulties
                    with the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy there as well as his mercurial behavior
                    all contributed to the inevitability of his downfall and it was just a question
                    of time. We had been speculating for some months prior to the actual August coup
                    as to when such a coup might occur so that, while the specific date was not
                    anticipated, the visit to the carrier had absolutely nothing to do with the
                    coup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he actually visit the carrier?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: No, he did not. The coup was occurring.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have made it look at the time as though the United
                        States was party to this operation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: There were efforts to give that spin and I was very active with the media
                    in pointing out that this was nonsense. In fact, I used a Central American term
                    when queried by the press. I said it was [babo sarras, poras babo sarras] which
                    means “nonsense” and was thoroughly discussed in the press for my correct use of
                    a rather arcane Central American Spanish usage which is nevertheless sanctioned
                    by the Royal Academy of Madrid, and was incorrectly translated as an improper
                    term by some American correspondents in their stories to the United States.
                    Nevertheless, we were able to show that there was no connection whatsoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left there in early 1984 and I know that you
                        devoted another four very active years in the service and they were very
                        interesting ones. I don't know how much you feel you can talk about some of
                        the things you did in the Inspection Corps where I know you had some major
                        investigative problems but, if there are any highlights, I think it would be
                        very useful to this series.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Given the nature of the work in the Inspection Corps, I don't think that
                    it is appropriate to go into details for this historical project and, without
                    the details, the generalities really are not very interesting except perhaps
                    some philosophical remarks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that would be very interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: I was shocked at the extent of the minor peculation in the executive
                    offices of our posts around the world and, by that, I mean ambassadors and, not
                    so much DCM's, but ambassadors and consuls general and their wives, either
                    personally obtaining benefits to which they were not entitled or insisting that
                    American and foreign national members of their staff violate the laws and
                    regulations and provide them such benefits. I was indefatigable in routing out
                    such abuses wherever my inspection team went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For example?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>CHAPIN: I mean buying rugs for the residence when no funds existed on credit
                    which could not properly be extended; decoration of residences beyond the levels
                    authorized by the Department of State or by the embassy in the case of
                    consulates general; the misrepresentation of the amounts of money spent on
                    representation in the case of a number principal officers; the misuse of travel
                    funds in other cases requiring subordinate officers to sign vouchers which they
                    believed to be fraudulent; and such extreme cases as the use of public monies
                    and public time for the construction of a coffin of the finest wood which was
                    tin lined for the dog of an ambassador's wife which had not yet died and this
                    was fished out from under the bed of the ambassador's wife while she was out of
                    the country by a “Deep Throat” source and appeared on my desk in brown paper on
                    top of my in-box so that I had to take official cognizance. But while that
                    appears amusing, there were many similar cases of, as I say, minor peculation.
                    They did not amount to more than thousands of dollars but funds were misused and
                    regulations were loosely interpreted.</p>
                <p>We tightened up, as a result of our findings, or we caused to tighten up a whole
                    series of rather dubious areas in the regulations, which permitted these clear
                    violations of the intent of Congress and the intent of the regulations. But
                    there were fraudulent aspects to many of these cases. It also showed that it was
                    virtually impossible under the laws and regulations to discipline let alone
                    prosecute any of the people who had committed these various crimes. The Justice
                    Department considered all of these violations of regulation, or in some cases
                    law, to be of such small magnitude that they simply refused to prosecute any of
                    these cases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So no action was taken against these individuals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: That is correct. In some cases initially we obtained reimbursement from
                    the individuals for the amounts which we showed them to be inconsistent with law
                    or regulations. However, the legal advisors office became very queasy about this
                    procedure and caused the Inspector General to instruct his inspectors to cease
                    and desist from attempting to obtain reimbursement from the individuals for
                    these misapplications of funds on the line of reasoning that the individual
                    inspectors were placing themselves at very substantial risk of suits by the
                    individuals. And, the United States government was reluctant to finance the
                    defense of the inspectors which, in my view, mitigated or greatly reduced the
                    role or the function of inspectors. We felt that certain object cases and object
                    lessons, if even circulated by the grapevine, would lead others to be more
                    careful in their actions. And, indeed, I believe that we have improved the use
                    of both official residence expenditure funds and representation funds. For
                    instance, we had one consular general for [a] fourth of July party, [who]
                    instead of charging the rental of a tent for his party to representation,
                    charged it to ordinary administrative expenses and described it as a temporary
                    windscreen and this was approved by the budget and fiscal personnel at the
                    capital who did not bother to look any more deeply into the voucher even though
                    it represented some thousands of dollars.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was a windscreen any more innocuous than a tent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: It wasn't. It was an attempt to pretend that this was an administrative
                    measure necessitated by natural weather conditions as a protection of the
                    property or the personnel of the consular general. It was deficient on the part
                    of the administrative personnel in the capital but it also showed that, as we
                    found on many occasions, the embassy and the capital had only the very
                    sketchiest idea of what was going on consulates or consulates general and that
                    the principal officers at some of these posts had even wider scope for personnel
                    peculation than did ambassadors at their own embassies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now there is also nowadays as I understand it in the
                        Inspection Corps, a mandate to inspect programs and objectives and country
                        policies, is there not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Yes, that's correct. We did that but in general the Foreign Service is
                    quite capable of managing those programs in a substantive sense. The problems
                    occur often in excessive staffing to carry out the task and sometimes, also, an
                    insufficient staff. This situation varies, particularly in consular operations
                    where workloads can suddenly shift a number of non-immigrant visa applicants can
                    suddenly rise as European currencies rose in value against the dollar and
                    vacations in the United States became much more attractive financially causing
                    posts in Europe to devise or have to devise on the spur of the moment entirely
                    new operating procedures in order to be able to cope with this flood on
                    applications. Other posts, for example, had turned into backwaters but personnel
                    had not been reduced to correspond with the decreasing load and there were
                    defenders of the particular posts who had emotional reasons for that for seeing
                    that the post was retained.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Either in the Foreign Service or in Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: That's correct. There's the Deputy Assistant Secretary who had
                    successfully kept alive a consular post which should have been closed many years
                    ago because he was principal officer at that post. And, there is another senator
                    who is very actively supporting a post at which he served in 1947. This kind of
                    interference with proper management is to me seriously regretted and it is only
                    the inspectors who are independent who I believe can at least repeatedly give
                    their independent view. Now, we found one consular post which also is maintained
                    largely because of political support in the United States in which there have
                    been 12,000 non-immigrant visa cases where no American had ever looked at the
                    cases. While this was alright as far as most of the applicants for tourist visas
                    were concerned, there were a considerable number of cases which were persons who
                    were rejected at the port of entry because they clearly did not meet the
                    criteria under the laws of the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which certainly shows at the very least a failure to
                        instruct the locals. The locals probably were giving the instruction to the
                        Foreign Service officer anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: The officer concerned was also one who was involved in personal
                    peculation. There tends to be a correlation, but not always, between a rather
                    cavalier attitude toward official duties and a rather cavalier attitude toward
                    the official funds entrusted to the individual. But I was frankly shocked by the
                    extent of this and I'm sure that we only touched the surface and encountered the
                    most egregious cases. Our teams only visited the post for a relatively brief
                    time and conducted the most superficial of audits. It was not a full scale
                    audit. But in some cases we were assisted by whistle blowers and in other cases
                    we came upon these matters in a fortuitous manner. We have attempted to pursue
                    criminal cases against some of the most grievous offenders. So far I've not
                    heard of a single conviction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That certainly would be a difficult thing to convict on, I
                        would think, considering that most of the evidence is broad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: We have had in the consular field successful prosecutions of national and
                    American employees who have sold visas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had a case like that in Salisbury back in the
                        ''50s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: That has been successful. One ambassador who has currently been
                    reappointed finally plea bargained with the Department and settled for
                    reimbursement of some $4,000 worth of clearly improper travel vouchers which he
                    had submitted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the whole did you enjoy this service as inspector. From
                        the travel point of view it has a great deal to recommend it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: The work is extremely onerous and the head of the inspection team has the
                    very difficult responsibility of presenting all of the difficult recommendations
                    to the Chief of Mission and to his deputy and justifying the findings. The work
                    became increasingly less pleasant and more difficult and, in efforts to reduce
                    the amount of time the inspection teams were abroad, there was virtually no time
                    even on U. S. national holidays and weekends to take any advantage of the
                    cultural aspects of the countries that we were visiting. We were working in many
                    cases seven days a week and often well into the night particularly during the
                    last three or four days at post. It is not an easy task by any means.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any final views on the Service? Would you
                        start all over again? Would you recommend a son or the son of a friend to do
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: I'm very interested in the two reports, summaries of which appeared in
                    the Washington Post this morning. I think it's very interesting that both of the
                    committees recommend abolition of the cone system. I've been doing that since
                    the cone system was initiated. I think that it is far too rigid and leads to
                    isolation of officers along a given track. I think that it's true that certain
                    officers should predominately have assignments in the consular area, economic
                    area. I think there's a lot of self-selection in that. So I welcome that aspect.
                    I am, however, very seriously concerned about the recommendation that much less
                    emphasis be given to both the written and oral examinations and that more weight
                    be placed on the so-called probationary selection boards. On the first point, I
                    think we risk getting a lot of Dexter Manleys by that route. I think it is
                    totally unacceptable that a student was carried for four years at a state
                    university when he was certainly unable to read at any high school level.</p>
                <p>On the question of the review panels for probationary officers, I've been
                    chairman of such committees on such selection boards on occasion and I can tell
                    you that the officers are rubber stamped and that there is a minimum of
                    information and that supervisors tend to give young officers the benefit of the
                    doubt in almost every case. Certain officers prove totally unsuited to the
                    Foreign Service and by that a percentage, something like 2% or 3% per annum, do
                    leave. But this is insufficient to give flexibility in the service and those
                    officers who receive poor ratings inevitably go to the Grievance Board and there
                    are long appeals of critical remarks which are made in their initial evaluation
                    reports.Therefore, I believe that only some of the automatic ceilings which have
                    been imposed on time in grade have any hope of weeding out in a practical manner
                    those officers who are less qualified to serve in the Foreign Service and I
                    think that the recommendations as a whole will result in a great deal of
                    discouragement of junior officers and will lead an increasing of the ablest
                    officers not to opt to come into the Foreign Service at all. I do think that
                    reducing the waiting time between passing the written examination and an actual
                    offer of appointment from two years to six months is long overdue, but that is a
                    technical problem. Should we reduce the testing procedures, I think we will wind
                    up perhaps not with illiterates but we will open the possibility of political
                    and pressure group influence on nominations at an early stage.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And lack of breadth in background, too, probably, of
                        candidates. That is, if you don't test them over a broader range of
                        background, you won't have any assurance of getting them.</hi>

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>CHAPIN: Yes. I served on oral selection panels and we often were predisposed to
                    pass a candidate if he or she could answer a few questions. On encountering a
                    candidate and talking with him or her we found that he or she was so narrow that
                    their interests really lay in a very specific kind of career and not the
                    multi-faceted career which was the Foreign Service, although the Foreign Service
                    in principle needed economists and other specialists. I particularly think of a
                    graduate of a Northeastern university, one of the best, who was active in a
                    series of econometric programs, but on interview proved to be a person far more
                    qualified to serve in the Census Bureau than in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of my favorite ____________ of the modern Foreign
                        Service personnel technique has been the performance/pay concept. What's
                        your view on this? I know why it was put in because it was the only way they
                        could get the money for top level people but it doesn't seem to me that the
                        concept is particularly appropriate for diplomatic performance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: The program, of course, is a government-wide program and while there are
                    abuses in the Department of State and the Foreign Service and inevitably the
                    persons in key administrative jobs receive performance pay as well as those who
                    are closely linked to the high command of the Department of State. The abuses I
                    think are much less than in what I've seen reported with regard to other
                    government agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I must say it's more of a psychological feeling with me
                        than any really scientific analysis. But it seems to me that many of the
                        things that a Foreign Service officer is called on to do, such as in your
                        case not claiming credit for trying people in El Salvador but making the
                        Defense Minister do it, that sort of thing, wouldn't get you any performance
                        pay but was what you should do. And if you'd announced it yourself it might
                        have made you more subject to performance pay ____________.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Not only performance pay. I think it would have greatly raised my profile
                    in a most beneficial way for my own career.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Well, yes . . .</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whether it's for the long term advantage of the United

                        objection.</hi>

                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>CHAPIN: Well, I clearly believe that it was not and that it was very important to
                    establish the principle that the military had to take responsibility for their
                    own dirty linen.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think politically _______________ international politics
                        it's more important, too, but that doesn't look like another case of Uncle
                        Sam interfering so much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Correct. That's the converse, if you will, of the military stepping up
                    and taking responsibility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I agree with your action but I just say that if your
                        prime consideration was a performance bonus you might not have taken that
                        action. Maybe I'm making a _________ point out of this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Yes. I think that the actual performance pay bonus that is received is,
                    after deducting taxes and so on, so marginal that it's a nice present but I
                    don't think that . . .</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Yes, but these are rarely given and people who receive those are already
                    capped in such a way that they can't receive anything like half of the . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, the cap applies to those, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought that was one of the things they did to get
                        around the cap. It's just undignified.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Well, it may be undignified but I can't seriously believe that many
                    people would be motivated by the possibility of performance pay to take an
                    action or inaction because the potential payoff is so uncertain that I don't
                    think any rational person could take that as a very serious factor in his or her
                    consideration of the matter. Although I must say that my experience in the
                    Inspection Corps with personal peculation which did not amount to large sums
                    leaves me in some doubt about the moral fiber of some of the members of our
                    Service. Of course, I want to say, that this matter applied and applies to
                    career and non-career ambassadors. It is extremely difficult and delicate when
                    you encounter a problem with a non-career ambassador. Although, on occasion,
                    some non-career ambassadors when the inconsistency with laws and regulations
                    have been pointed out to them, have been very forthcoming and very pleasant in
                    making appropriate adjustments.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would guess, based on experience, that possibly their
                        administrative officers in the excess of desire to keep them happy, have
                        perhaps led them to believe that what they were doing was all right. I don't
                        know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: We found the reverse, where administrative officers have been instructed,
                    although they have objected to the individual, to go ahead and do so. There are
                    obviously both cases, but I think it is particularly heinous if an officer and a
                    senior. . .</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Yes, and this we have found. Of course, another area in which we were
                    active was in curbing the donations to ambassadors for a variety of purposes,
                    particularly in Europe. This came out of our inspection of the Bureau of
                    European Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Switzerland, as I remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Well, that's only one of many cases but it was the Inspection Corps which
                    highlighted the variety of different techniques being used and the questionable
                    practices and led to a basic adjustment in those matter. Similarly, it was an
                    inspection of the U. S. Mission to the United Nations which resulted in efforts
                    to comply in some measure with the intent of Congress with regard to housing and
                    the use of vehicles both of which have been seriously abused and regulations had
                    either been ignored or no appropriate regulations had been issued to implement
                    laws passed by the Congress.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: Yes, and __________also in terms of abuse rate or ignoring. The
                    provisions with regard to use of cars and representation funds. We found uses of
                    representation funds which specifically are listed in the regulations of the
                    Department of State as “contrary to law.” I call that illegal. There are no
                    penalties, however, in most of these cases for such actions and that's another
                    area. . .</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Although you won't be able to get them to reimburse

                <p>Have you got something to say about the family and the Foreign Service? Do you

                <p>CHAPIN: My career was rather unusual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have an unusual number of rather difficult posts, I
                        would say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPIN: No, rather the contrary. All during the years that my children were
                    growing up or at least during most of them we were in Washington. We had almost
                    14 years in Washington and so our children were really not exposed to as
                    extensive foreign experience as many Foreign Service officers. It was only once
                    the children were of a certain age that we had posts that were extremely
                    difficult. We did, of course, go to the Chad which was difficult but we've had
                    our hardship posts but I think all Foreign Service officers have. The
                    psychological hardships in some of the last posts were greater than the physical
                    discomforts. I don't think that any Chief of Mission as such has, but there were
                    very serious security problems in both El Salvador and Guatemala. There were
                    eight attempts on my life in Guatemala and there were seven attacks on the
                    Chancery building in El Salvador during the 3-1/2 months I was in charge. There
                    was a security threat, although a much lower one in Sao Paulo. In fact, I think
                    it was exaggerated by the government and served as a method to attempt to curb
                    my activities.</p>
