                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 18th of March 2005. This is an interview with
                        Geoffrey W. Chapman. This is being done on behalf of the Association of
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training, and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Do you go
                        by Geoff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Geoff, that's right, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I imagine you have lots of trouble with spelling your
                        name, I'm sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Occasionally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, well...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Though less now than I used to have, actually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's start at the beginning, where you were
                        born...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Well, I have somewhat of an unusual background. I was born in England on
                    June 23, 1942. I can explain the circumstances, if you would like. I was born, a
                    British citizen, in a small town called Bedford, just north of London. My family
                    actually came from a town called Eastbourne in Sussex, in the southern part of
                    the country. But they'd been evacuated during the war to an area further from
                    the coast. The family returned to Eastbourne at the end of the war, but then
                    both my father and mother died in 1948, and my sister and I were orphans for a
                    while at an orphanage in Dorset, in southwestern England. Then we were adopted
                    by an American couple in 1949, and came to this country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, well lets just pick up a little...did you know
                        much about your family, your birth family?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I was only five years old when my parents died, but in subsequent years
                    I have picked up some information, particularly from cousins in England, one of
                    whom has done a fair amount of research into the family. So, I do know a little
                    bit about my mother's side, but virtually nothing about my father's side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the family name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The family name was Williams. My father was a Welshman, this was his
                    second marriage, and he was a good 42 years older than my mother.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh my God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: My mother died of colon cancer at the age of 40, and my father died just
                    two months afterwards of a cerebral hemorrhage. I think it was probably the
                    strain of taking care of two very young children at that advanced age, while
                    trying to run his own business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of business was he in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: He was a fishmonger. He had a small fish shop just below the apartment
                    we lived in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, do you know how the adoption came about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: My adoptive mother was English-born. She took charge of the adoption,
                    and went to what was then called the Church of England Adoption Society and
                    requested the particulars of any children they had up for adoption. They were
                    looking for a brother and sister, and I think we were the first brother and
                    sister they came across or the right ages or whatever it might be; so we got
                    selected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in the orphanage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Barely ten months, I think it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall the orphanage's name?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I remember very little of it. It certainly wasn't Dickensian. I mean
                    this was 1948-49. It was a relatively well-run orphanage in a pleasant small
                    town on the south coast of England, in the county of Dorset. I remember getting
                    out exercising, going for walks in the countryside. I hadn't been used to a
                    comfortable upbringing; my family being very poor. I remember the food was
                    sufficient, at least, and there were plenty of other kids our age.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: —muffled question—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Well I was used to it. It wasn't exactly gourmet. The only concrete
                    recollection I have about the food is that the orphanage got one bottle of
                    orange juice per week, and one of the children used to have to go to a shop in
                    the village once a week to pick it up. The glass bottle must have been this
                    high...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, about a foot high, eh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: ...and as a five year-old I carried this thing very carefully down the
                    road about half a mile back to the orphanage. That was how strained the
                    circumstances were in England after World War II. One bottle of orange juice per
                    week for some twenty little children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then in '48, you went to...where did you go in the
                        United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: March of '49 to Boston.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With, I take it, the Chapmans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Right, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a bit about the Chapmans?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: We had a nice townhouse on Beacon Hill in Boston, smack in the middle of
                    the city; one block below the famous Louisburg Square. My father was from a
                    fairly distinguished family; one of his ancestors being the Founding Father John
                    Jay. John Jay II, the grandson, was a diplomat for a while, Minister to Vienna,
                    as well as a lifelong abolitionist. There was a strong abolitionist tradition on
                    both sides of the family, both the Jay side (John Jay himself and his son,
                    William Jay, and then John Jay II) and on the Chapman side, as well. Maria
                    Weston Chapman, my father's great-grandmother, was a lifelong collaborator with
                    William Lloyd Garrison in Boston. The Chapmans were a Boston family from way
                    back, although my father's father, the essayist John Jay Chapman, was a lifelong
                    New York resident.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, extremely well known.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Well, he wasn't terribly well known at the time. He was eccentric. He
                    wrote some very good stuff on Emerson and was very close with Henry James, Walt
                    Whitman, and other well-known writers of the era.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was life, before we move to school, in the
                        family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: My father was in fact old enough to be my grandfather, in his early
                    fifties when I was a mere six-year-old. He had served in the Navy in World War
                    I, had returned to Harvard afterwards to get his degree, and had then gone on to
                    Oxford for a couple of years, where his roommate at Oxford was Lester Pearson,
                    who was later Prime Minister of Canada. He went on to get a doctorate at the
                    Sorbonne in Paris in Byzantine history, and then became a headmaster of a school
                    in France at a school for the sons of American diplomats and businessmen living
                    in Europe. The school folded after a couple of years so he founded another
                    school of his own, which didn't last very long either. He came back to this
                    country in the late '30s and had a series of jobs, although no real profession,
                    apart from that of a scholar generally, because there was a lot of family money
                    on both sides. He then got very involved in the conservation and was one of the
                    founders of the Nature Conservancy, later serving as its President. That was his
                    principal focus into his late seventies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about on your mother's side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: My mother was English-born and had been what the English call a
                    governess in her early adult years. She married my father after they had known
                    each other for just a few months in 1937, and then came to this country. She
                    never became Americanized and kept all her English traditions and her English
                    accent. I still have a bit of that accent.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say, for a child of five...I won't say
                        terribly pronounced but your accent...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Well, there's more to it than that, but obviously being around my mother
                    much of the time was a major influence on me, obviously. She did some teaching
                    on the side, but didn't have a full-time occupation of her own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, how about life at home; one thinks that that
                        area of Boston is sort of an intellectual center of...were there discussions
                        around the table of things going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Well, I don't remember much about our table discussions in the early
                    fifties. In subsequent years, I would say there was only a limited amount of
                    intellectual discussion. We differed a lot because at that point I was fairly
                    liberal; while he was extremely conservative. So, we often just didn't talk
                    about issues we knew that we would disagree quite violently on sometimes. There
                    were occasionally some interesting guests in for dinner. My father had done a
                    fair amount of travel in the Middle East back in the 1930s and considered
                    himself a bit of an Arabist, and I know was quite active in the late 40s and
                    early 50s trying to provide support for the Palestinians. But it wasn't a
                    household where there were constant discussions going on, no, that just wasn't
                    the case. Maybe I missed a lot of discussions because I was whisked off to a
                    boarding school at the age of eight in the fall of 1950.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Initially my parents looked around at some boarding schools in their
                    area, but then thought that boarding schools in Canada would be better. They put
                    me down for Rothesay School in New Brunswick, but since the school had a minimum
                    admission age of nine I went off to another school in Nova Scotia for a year. I
                    then transferred to Rothesay but was pulled out of there after a single
                    semester, the reasons for which I don't remember. The family then went over to
                    England on a visit in the spring of 1952, and my parents decided to put me in
                    school there. So, I was actually at school in England from the summer of 1952 to
                    the summer of 1960. First at what the English called a prep school, until I was
                    12 years old, and then what the call a public school, in Essex, until I was just
                    18.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the prep school like, Geoff, how did you find
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: It wasn't a difficult transition for me because all of the all the
                    changes I had lived through already in losing my parents, being adopted, moving
                    here from another country. And there weren't any really close family bonds. So
                    it was never difficult for me to go to boarding school. It was fairly Spartan,
                    you might say; again food-rationing still existed in England at that point in
                    1952. There was a fairly rigorous academic curriculum and a lot of sports. You
                    couldn't leave the campus on your own. It was a regimented life, but that was to
                    be expected, that was the norm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And public school, where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: A school called Felsted in Essex. Again, it was a pretty Spartan place:
                    rigorous academically, sports, uniforms, had to be in bed by a certain time; it

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this public school one of the sort of... pointing
                        towards public service or the military or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: As I recall there was no particular effort to educate students for
                    public service in any form or fashion. Some did go into public service; but most
                    went into private business.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What courses particularly did you enjoy and what ones
                        didn't you enjoy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The system there took you through a very varied curriculum until about
                    the age of 16. From the age of 16 to 18 you were considered to be preparing for
                    university, so you specialized in two or three subjects. I specialized in
                    history and French language and literature. I was not very good in mathematics
                    or anything scientific. I did not enjoy ancient Greek, which I studied for a
                    couple of years, although Latin I handled quite easily.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: No, the school did not turn co-ed in the 1970s. There was one dance a
                    year to which young ladies were invited, and that was basically it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went to a prep school in New England, which was run by

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, that meant that we were running around trying
                        to find dates around Christmastime and during the summer and all, but most
                        of the time it was pretty austere. How about reading; any particular areas
                        that you [read] for your own recreation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: You mean back at that time when I was in high school?</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I honestly don't recall very much. I probably didn't read much extra
                    during the school year because there was so much homework to do. During the
                    summertime I generally read novels and historical biographies, but nothing
                    particular of jumps out at me at this point.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: No, I did no American history, and actually I did none in college
                    either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from public school when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1960. Did you know what you were going to do or what you
                        were going to be? You know, as an American-British...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Well, I had actually become a naturalized American citizen in 1957. So,
                    I guess at that point the thinking was that I would spend my life here in this
                    country. I think both my father and I were agreed that it would be good to come
                    back here to college. So I ended up at Bowdoin College in Maine for four years.
                    I found that a very difficult transition, going from an English environment to
                    an American college. I really was much more English than American, at that
                    point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would imagine so.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I knew nobody. American customs were sort of foreign to me, in a way.
                    The curriculum I had followed in public school was very different from a high
                    school curriculum in the last few years. So, the first semester was a very
                    difficult adjustment period for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why Bowdoin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I was attracted to the idea of a small liberal arts college, from what
                    research I'd done on it. My father and his father and grandfather....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say...either you were a little bit like
                        John Adams...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Had gone to Harvard, but he was very down on Harvard at that point, and
                    said, “If you want to go to Harvard, I won't pay for it”. So, scratch that one
                    off. Yes, I was attracted to places like Williams, Amherst, Bowdoin,
                    Wesleyan...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went to Williams.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: What class were you in?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Class of '50.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I can't recall exactly why I chose Bowdoin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to make the adjustment yourself or was there
                        any help or did you understand how you were out of sync with everybody?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Well, it was basically an adjustment I made on my own. I don't want to
                    over-emphasize how difficult it was; it just took a little time. Socially I was
                    just not accustomed to the kind of life at a college like that. Academically I
                    was faced with a need for a math requirement; and I hadn't done any math in two
                    years or more. Here I was, sitting down with calculus, and wondering what it was
                    all about. I hadn't done any science in a long time. Some courses, such as
                    history, seemed so simple, so straightforward, so elementary compared to what
                    I'd been doing in England. I had some professors whom I got to know well during
                    that first year, and a few of them were very helpful and especially solicitous
                    towards me, but basically it was something I worked out on my own.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that history was still your thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I think I more or less went in with the idea of majoring in history, and
                    I did ultimately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular area of history?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: European history. I didn't take an American history courses at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself coming up short on...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I had to do American history in graduate school. But at Bowdoin it was
                    all European (various stages), Russian history, special subjects in European
                    history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find American college life pretty wild or
                        different?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Bowdoin had a reputation as a party school. But I did not join a
                    fraternity; largely because my father would not allow it. His philosophy was
                    that you go to college to study, not there to party. So I didn't. Bowdoin was a
                    very small college back in those days. I think the total student body numbered
                    just over 800, and only about 20 students were not fraternity members. The
                    twenty of us ate together in the cafeteria and socialized together a bit, but it
                    wasn't obviously the full experience you get with fraternity social life.
                    Basically, I spent most of my time studying: I played on the soccer team for
                    four years and did some radio broadcasting and a few other extra-curricular
                    activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find yourself tuning into American political
                        life and...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Oh yeah, certainly within the year or so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find...you said your father was particularly quite
                        conservative and you became quite liberal, did you find yourself in the...?
                        You were there during the Kennedy period, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Not that much. I was coming into this relatively new, and I didn't have
                    the experience of someone who had lived through the Eisenhower period in this
                    country to see what the change was and the sense of a new beginning. To a
                    certain degree, I picked that up and was a part of it. And my father was a very
                    strong Goldwater supporter, and he would leave all of his Goldwater books in my
                    room at home, hoping that I would read them. I actually never did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any particular political thrust to the faculty
                        at Bowdoin at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: It wasn't a time of great political ferment on campuses, and certainly
                    not at Bowdoin. I don't recall much in the way of political controversy at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was after McCarthy and before...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Before Vietnam, right. So, in '63 we were just getting involved in
                    Vietnam, and there was no real controversy at that point. I don't recall any
                    professors who stood out as being either at one extreme or the other; most of
                    them seemed to be politically middle-of-the-road. I don't recall any major
                    student issues that would have divided the student body. It was a relatively
                    quiescent time politically on campus.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Well, usually from the Boston area. It was quite a ways off. I got to
                    know some from friends I'd made at college there, sisters or friends of theirs.
                    A few I'd met incidentally in the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where's your sister? What was her course of
                        education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: She was a couple years older than myself. She similarly had gone to
                    school in England, but had no ambition to go to college and trained as a nurse
                    in Edinburgh. Then she got married after finishing her nursing course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were at college, did you feel yourself pointed

                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: In my senior year I was strongly tempted to go to law school. I had
                    taken a course in international law at Bowdoin and had enjoyed it tremendously.
                    I seem to recall getting an A+ in the course. The professor who taught the
                    course was pushing me to go to law school, but I had done most of my studying in
                    history and the professor whom I was closest with was pushing me to go to
                    graduate school in history. So I came to the decision to study history at
                    graduate school and probably go on to teach it and to write in that field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to grad school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Princeton.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Princeton. And why there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Because I wanted to study under a particular professor, Robert Palmer,
                    who, as it turned out, decided to accept the deanship at Washington University
                    in St. Louis literally two weeks after I had signed on to go to Princeton.
                    Palmer was a renowned authority on the French Revolution and on 18th century and
                    19th century French and European history generally. The history department
                    overall was considered the best in the country at that point. There were some
                    really fine people in a whole series of fields.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you went to Princeton from '64 to...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I was at in Princeton from '64 to '68, then spent two years in the
                    military and went back to Princeton in 1970-71 to finish up my dissertation and
                    to teach part-time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you had four years at Princeton, '64 to '68, what were
                        you specializing in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: My field of specialization was European history from the mid-19th
                    century to early twentieth; but I covered other areas as well such as Russian
                    and Soviet history. There were two very fine professors in the latter field:
                    James Billington, who is now Librarian of Congress, and Cyril Black. I also did
                    a fair amount of American history as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your studies center on? Did you come up with a

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes, I wrote a dissertation. I spent a year doing research in Paris and
                    in Rome; although I didn't choose the subject for those two cities.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: That's right, indeed. It was in fact quite tough doing historical
                    research in Paris, at least in the area of the contemporary or modern history of
                    France. As of 1967, some categories of archival records were closed after 1815
                    and virtually nothing was available after 1914.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think that I have tried to get a connection with

                <p>CHAPMAN: I found as well that a lot of French statesmen and politicians would
                    simply destroy their papers upon leaving office, or instruct their heirs to do
                    so. Maybe they felt there was incriminating evidence in there, or some things
                    they would not want out in public over the next 50 or 100 years. Very few would
                    write their memoirs, and if they did they were very exculpatory, revealing
                    little about the key controversial issues that they were involved in. So, it was
                    a difficult environment for a historian, but I worked through that, and Italy
                    was quite the opposite. Things were so open there it was unbelievable, and
                    largely because they were on the wrong side in World War II. Practically
                    everything up to the end of the Fascist period was open. So, my dissertation was
                    basically on domestic politics in those two countries on the eve of World War I,
                    posing the question how the state of domestic politics conditioned the decisions
                    made in 1914 in the international crisis of July.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things, its not quite on the subject, but
                        something I've had quoted to me and I've used it, was on the eve of 1914 and
                        of World War I, in all of the correspondence and discussions that went back
                        and forth, the United States wasn't mentioned at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: That's true, no mention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you were in France, you were there before the
                        '68...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Les evenements, yes, before then. I was in Paris from January of '67
                    through end of July '67, and then I went to Rome for the rest of the year until
                    January of '68.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the rest of [the] student body or
                        you were pretty much doing your thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Well, I was pretty much doing my own thing. My advisor at Princeton had
                    a contact he gave me at La Sorbonne, a well-known historian of international
                    relations. I went to him to get pointers and thoughts as to where I should go
                    next, but basically I made my own way to the National Archives, the Bibliotheque
                    National, and other archival collections around town. I picked up the names of
                    other scholars working in the area and found out more from them. I did not have
                    that much involvement with the Sorbonne as such. I was over there a lot on the
                    Left Bank, and frequently used to eat there and just wander around. It was the
                    exciting place to be in town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yeah. Well then, you got caught up in the draft.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: No, not drafted. I went through ROTC in college so I had a two-year
                    active-duty commitment which I was able to postpone for four years, up until the
                    summer of '68.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened on the military side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: My commission was in intelligence...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which branch of the service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I was in the Army, and it was standard practice for intelligence
                    officers to start with the basic infantry officer's course at Fort Benning. I
                    was at Benning in July and August, suffering through the unbearable heat and
                    humidity. But then rather than being given a regular line assignment, I was
                    assigned to a junior faculty position at the National War College. General
                    Goodpaster, then the commandant, wanted to give the War College more of an
                    academic bent that it had at the time. It had no teaching faculty of its own and
                    no research component; the faculty were basically administering rather than
                    teaching. So Goodpaster was looking for young academics to come in and start a
                    research program there at the National War College, and my name was put forward
                    by a Princeton colleague who had been recruited for a similar program at the
                    Industrial College of the Armed Forces next door. So, I spent my active-duty
                    years in the military (two years) at the National War College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was, of course, from '68 to '70, when the height of
                        our involvement in Vietnam...how did that reflect, when looking at it, on
                        the military as they were training? There must have been a lot of programs
                        about this, wasn't there or not? At the War College, people wondering,
                        questioning...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Do you mean questioning our commitment, our policy?</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our commitment, on how things were going, yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: There really wasn't. The student body were military officers at the rank
                    of Lieutenant Colonel and Colonel who were not, at that stage, sticking their
                    necks out to question policy. They were focused on their military careers; what
                    it takes to get ahead, what it takes to make General rank. There was some review
                    of the history of the French-Vietnamese conflict in the '50s, but I don't recall
                    any free-flowing discussion of the merits of American involvement in Vietnam. I
                    don't think that was the cast of the military mind at that point. I don't
                    remember much in the way of questioning of our policy on the part of Foreign
                    Service people attending the College, although I was certainly not with them all
                    of the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Goodpaster had in fact left the College just before I got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: That's right. He had been at the National War College only on a
                    temporary assignment, to recuperate from a heart attack or some health problem.
                    The general who replaced him as commandant really didn't know what to do with
                    this research unit that Goodpaster had created. For a while the four of us in
                    the unit were left to our own devices to come up with issues that we felt needed
                    researching and doing some work on them. We then started working on curriculum
                    materials, largely case studies on international crises that we would then put
                    before the students in their discussion groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the course of this and prior to this when you were
                        doing your research and all, did diplomacy as a career...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I think that's when it first really came to my mind, when I was at the
                    National War College. I did interact with quite a few of the mid-career Foreign
                    Service officers who were attending the War College. I traveled a couple of
                    times with War College groups overseas, once to the Middle East and once to the
                    Far East. I met a lot of embassy people my age in the capitals we visited. So,
                    that's what got me thinking more about a career in Foreign Service, as opposed
                    to teaching. When I finished military service and went back to Princeton to
                    write my dissertation and teach part-time for a year, I had both teaching and
                    diplomacy in mind as career tracks. I went through the laborious process of
                    looking for a teaching job, sitting for numerous interviews and writing scores
                    of letters, and was offered a teaching job in Michigan. At the same time, I took
                    the written Foreign Service exam and then went on to the oral. In the spring of
                    1971 I had to make a decision and eventually came out in favor of the Foreign
                    Service, with the thought being that if it didn't work out, I had my PhD and I
                    could go back and get a teaching job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you took the oral exam, do you recall any of the
                        questions or anything...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I remember there was an examining panel of three, chaired by Bill
                    Woessner. Bill was a German-hand, and this was an eventful period in Germany
                    with the Brandt government having come into power in '69 and the negotiations on
                    the Quadripartite agreement underway. I recall having being told that the best
                    preparation for the foreign service exam and for the oral was just to read the
                    New York Times thoroughly for a year, which is what I had done, focusing on
                    foreign news. So I had read quite a lot about what was going on in Germany and
                    in the Berlin negotiations, and I remember getting into some long conversations
                    with Bill Woessner on those subjects. Melissa Wells, another member of the
                    panel, asked me a few questions about economics and about the European
                    community. It was over faster than I thought it would be; it went very smoothly,
                    and I don't remember there being any difficult moments at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came in when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: September 1971.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering— had you thought about the academic life?
                        Because many people who come into the Foreign Service, they looked hard at
                        the academic life and the academic politics and all, and that sort of turned
                        them off. Did you have any feel for that before?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: No, I don't think academic politics turned me off. I think what turned
                    me in the favor of a foreign service rather academic career was more a sense
                    that I wasn't ready for a more contemplative existence in an academic community
                    somewhat divorced from the real world. I wanted to go out and do something more
                    active and become a participant in events, rather than study them and teach them
                    and think about them. I think I was looking for a more active professional life
                    rather than the contemplative existence of the scholar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had a significant other developed at this point or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes, I was actually married in graduate school, back in '65.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's the background of your wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I'd met her in California. Her father was a Congregational minister; her
                    mother was a professional violinist. She had just finished college, and we had
                    met through mutual friends in California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were married when you came into the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your basic officer's course like? What sort of
                        composition, what sort of field did you pick when you came in '71?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: My recollection is that it was short and superficial, really. I don't
                    think it is anything like the way it is now. We had a series of outside
                    speakers, basically hitting the substantive issues of the moment. I remember an
                    off-site out in West Virginia. The whole course went very quickly, and it did
                    not make that much of an impression on me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. How about the young officers; did they make any
                        impression on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: We were a young and eager bunch, mostly in our mid- to late-twenties.
                    Practically all of us had done graduate work and had considered or started other
                    careers....</p>
                <p>[end of tape]</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>...and it was a good group of people. We of course scattered after eight weeks,
                    but I kept up with some of the group through the years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any place in mind where you wanted to go, and
                        then what actually happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Essentially my whole academic and linguistic experience was European, so
                    that's where I wanted to end up. At that time, there was no requirement for
                    taking an initial consular tour, so personnel had to come up with political
                    assignments for the ten political officers in the class. They could come up with
                    only about four such assignments overseas so the remainder of us were put into
                    Department jobs, and I ended up in what was then the Office of German affairs,
                    working on Berlin matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh boy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: So that's how I ended up in my first overseas assignment to Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you know I've talked to many people who have been
                        involved with Berlin; it's really like a priesthood. You learned a theology
                        of Berlin, and all that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I learned it over the years, initially from the office director, Jim
                    Sutherland, and the head of my unit, Nelson Ledsky. I began in German affairs
                    just after the Quadripartite Agreement had been concluded and as talks were
                    getting underway between the two German states aimed at putting more flesh on
                    the bones of the agreement. I recall writing summaries of these inner-German
                    negotiations for the then assistant secretary, Martin Hillenbrand. Otherwise I
                    was called upon to write briefing papers on all manner of subjects and to fill
                    in for anyone in the office who was absent on leave or for some other reason. So
                    I had to become acquainted with a fair cross-section of substantive matters and
                    functions within the office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would imagine that, as you say, that after the
                        quadripartite agreement, there was a lot of work in putting this into
                        practical instruction. Was there a feeling at that time that we have lanced
                        the Berlin boil and this is no longer going to be the most dangerous
                        spot?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I think so. The idea was that we could reach, not a final solution of
                    the Berlin issue, but a reasonable modus vivendi with the Soviets, resulting in
                    a more tolerable situation without the tensions that had marked the fifties and
                    the sixties. There was the hope, particularly among the West Germans, of an
                    improvement in inner-German relations that would allow for greater interaction
                    on a societal as well as a governmental leveprovisions for regular visits to the
                    East and for practical improvements in the lives of Berliners. Berlin would not
                    longer be a major bone of contention among the United States, Soviet Union,
                    Britain and France. We could and did have differences of interpretation with the
                    Soviets on particular provisions of the agreement; but our hope was that these
                    would remain at the theological level and allow us to move ahead in a practical
                    sense. One consequence of the agreement was our decision to recognize the GDR
                    and open an embassy in East Berlin, the latter being a major theological issue
                    in itself — how can you open an embassy in the capital of a country when you
                    don't recognize that capital as part of the country, but rather as an occupation
                    zone. All kinds of dancing around on pinheads had to be done to reconcile such
                    issues. When I arrived in Berlin in January 1973 for my first overseas
                    assignment I got increasingly drawn into issues of interpretation of the
                    Quadripartite Agreement, of which there were many. And that was when I received
                    my real practical training in becoming and Berlin and German expert.</p>

                        the tailgates of a truck. Well know, did you sense a division between the

                        exchange back and forth so that they were all thinking more or less along
                        the same lines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: There were some differences. I think it was largely a matter of
                    “where-you-sit-is-where-you stand”. The people in Berlin on the spot tended to
                    think more in specifically Berlin terms, and in terms of sustaining our legal
                    position in Berlin. In Bonn and in Washington they were thinking of a larger
                    framework of relations with Germany and relations with the Soviet Union and
                    other parts of Europe. But that said, a lot of the people in Bonn had served in
                    Berlin and vice-versa so they had the same intellectual formation and the same
                    experiences in their background.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I was there from January '73 to July '76. I started out as a junior
                    officer in the political section; helping out in practically all of the
                    specialized functions in the section. After about nine months I was given the
                    job of Liaison and Protocol Officer. The Protocol Officer function was largely a
                    formal one, with responsibility for relations with the various foreign
                    consulates situated in the American sector. But it got me invitations to all
                    kinds of receptions around town, much more than a first-tour officer would
                    normally receive. The liaison function meant that I was the primary contact with
                    the Soviet embassy in East Berlin on all Berlin matters. So, I was sort of
                    thrown into the center of substantive Berlin matters fairly early on, and spent
                    quite a lot of time in discussions with the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now who was the head of the West Berlin office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: He bore the titles of both Minister, in Foreign Service terms, and
                    Deputy Commandant, as part of the Allied occupation structure still in effect.
                    The Commandant was a two-star Army general, but in practice he exercised little
                    more than a formal role in political issues regarding Berlin. Moreover our
                    Ambassador in Bonn was the Commandant's superior on non-military matters.
                    Basically we were an autonomous unit, responsive to the embassy in Bonn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Minister over there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: David Klein, succeeded in 1974 by Scott George. The ambassador in Bonn
                    then was Martin Hillenbrand, whom I got to know fairly well as I served as his
                    aide when he came up to Berlin, which he did quite often. I would serve as
                    note-taker for his periodic meetings with the Soviet Ambassador in East Berlin,
                    generally held over lunch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Martin Hillenbrand; how did he
                        operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: He was a quiet, low-key diplomat; and gave the impression of being a
                    scholar rather than a forceful, hard-charging diplomat. But he was very
                    effective precisely because he was extremely competent and extremely
                    knowledgeable. And he had no compunction about challenging the Soviets when that
                    was needed. He ran afoul of Henry Kissinger and certain others at various times
                    in his career, but he was sort of a mentor to me, and I admired him greatly. He
                    was very kind, very gracious.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much were we involved at this point with matters in
                        the governing of Berlin? I know at one time we had people who were very much
                        involved with the police and that sort of thing....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Essentially what we provided was a legal cover. Berlin had its own
                    elected city government which performed the whole range of normal functions of a
                    local government. The West German constitution considered Berlin to be a West
                    German state. The Allies had negated that portion of the basic law, but to all
                    practical intents and purposes West Berlin was a part of West Germany. But there
                    were certain issues having to do with the status of the city that were reserved
                    for the Allies, and there was a formal decision-making structure involving us,
                    the British and the French to make decisions on such issues. There were
                    certainly differences between the Allies and the Berlin authorities, but we
                    rarely if ever got involved in the real substance of local government and
                    relations with the Governing Mayor and his officials were generally very smooth.
                    There were officers at the Allied missions who supervised the police in their
                    respective sectors and who had to approve certain police actions. For instance,
                    the Berlin police were allowed to carry weapons when making an arrest; but due
                    to some quirk in occupation law they couldn't carry machine pistols without
                    express authorization. So they would call up the relevant Allied officer to
                    request permission, which was automatically given. So it was largely putting a
                    judicial and legal gloss on actions that were normal actions of the city
                    government at the time. There were in addition certain reserved areas where the
                    Allies were alone competent to act. These generally had to do with the borders
                    of Berlin. In my liaison job with the Soviet embassy; I was often involved in
                    very practical issues of access to East Berlin by Americans. There were some
                    American troops stationed in Berlin who got caught up with exfiltration rings —
                    smuggling East Germans out across the wall. Sometimes they would get caught by
                    the East Germans, and there then be a protracted legal tussle. Since we did not
                    recognize East German control in East Berlin, we would deal only with the
                    Soviets on such matters. The Soviets would initially refuse to get involved,
                    asserting that East Berlin was under GDR control. But eventually they would
                    relent and take charge of the case. I recall going to visit U.S. servicemen
                    detained at the Soviet garrison in East Berlin to check on their well-being. I
                    would then work out their release with the Soviets, who were generally amicable
                    while making the expected political points. This was the height of the Cold War
                    and here was I, a junior FSO, dealing with Soviet colonels at one of the
                    checkpoints on the wall. This was exciting stuff. While the Soviets made a great
                    show of upholding GDR sovereignty in East Berlin and proclaiming friendship with
                    their German socialist brothers, deep down they relished exercising their
                    imperium in East Berlin and putting the East Germans in their place. This was,
                    after all, not so long after the end of the war, and memories of what the
                    Germans had perpetrated on the USSR were still very much alive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How'd you find the Soviets, the ones you were dealing
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: They were difficult to deal with, some more so than others, but they
                    probably found us difficult to deal with as well. We would assert our legal view
                    on a given issue and they would assert theirs. We'd get into controversies over
                    us holding the Soviets responsible for a lot of things going on in East Berlin,
                    and they'd say “Oh no, we're not responsible for those things, its all a matter
                    for the sovereign East German government; we wash our hands of those things”.
                    And eventually after you'd push them a lot they'd come back and acknowledge they
                    could help out, maybe “we could persuade the East Germans to do this, that, or
                    the other. There was clearly an acknowledgement of a residual Soviet role in the
                    city. Our language of business was German; I don't recall any of the Soviet
                    diplomats speaking English, and at that point I didn't speak Russian. They were
                    products of their system, of course, and weren't open to free-ranging
                    discussions. We'd often have lunch together in either East Berlin or West
                    Berlin; and they would religiously go through their instructions from Moscow to
                    ask about U.S. policies on issues A, B, C, and D. You'd hear them go through the
                    litany in their minds, and you would explain to them U.S. views or what our
                    general thinking was, but you wouldn't get anything back from them. They were
                    just taking note of what you had said, so they could report it back. There was
                    no real exchange back and forth; I don't think there was ever any
                    letting-your-hair-down and pushing back and having a drink together and that
                    sort of thing. I also dealt with the Soviets in West Berlin. The Quadripartite
                    Agreement provided for them to set up a Consulate General in West Berlin, and
                    since they chose to locate this in the U.S. sector I, as U.S. protocol officer,
                    was involved with them in a number of concrete arrangements regarding
                    accreditation, privileges and the like. The Soviets were all the time pressing
                    to be accorded greater privileges than other members of the consular corps in
                    West Berlin, which we would not allow. So there was a constant battle to pare
                    them back to what was their proper level. And those were some difficult people
                    to deal with, several of the key people with whom I dealt being KGB
                    officers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it penetrate to your level the sort of spy vs. spy
                        atmosphere of Berlin at that time? Did you see any KGB and every other
                        intelligence out or ....?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I knew that certain Soviets I dealt with were KGB people, rather than
                    diplomats, but there certainly was no attempt on their part to recruit me. The
                    Soviet Consulate General in West Berlin was largely an intelligence operation;
                    there was little consular work for them. Plus it was a status question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about dealing with the French and British
                        officials?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: We were very close with the British, but not so with the French. We and
                    the British saw eye-to-eye on most things. The French tended to keep to
                    themselves a bit more and to be a lot more theological than even we were, in
                    term of Berlin as an occupied city. Their attitudes towards the Berliners were
                    different from ours, and they tended to assert their prerogatives much more than
                    we did. I knew a few of them, not particularly well. They had the best officer's
                    club in town, and it was a delight to go there and enjoy a good French meal at
                    rock-bottom prices. A fair amount of the funding of the Allied presence in
                    Berlin came from the West Germans, so-called “occupation costs”. The French
                    would really abuse that privilege, charging the Germans for things that we or
                    the British would never consider charging. It was the French practice was to
                    bring all of their new army recruits up to Berlin for their initial training and
                    to charge all the costs to the German government, which we all thought was a
                    little egregious. Maybe that was part of the French psyche, a product of the
                    vicissitudes of Franco-German relations over the centuries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about relations with the Germans in Berlin; how did
                        you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I thought it was an easygoing relationship; I don't recall any major
                    issues over status. We recognized them for what they were, the government that
                    was in practice in charge of the city. They accepted our role and recognized
                    that the United States, and to a certain extent, Britain and France, were the
                    ultimate guarantors of Berlin's freedom and political system. So I think it was
                    an easy working relationship. They were very forthcoming with information; they
                    took us into their confidence, and I don't remember any major controversies
                    between us and the Germans in Berlin at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did we recognize East Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: We established diplomatic relations in mid '74 and then had opened an
                    embassy later in the year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, this was after you'd left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: No, I was there. And in fact I had a peripheral role in helping Felix
                    Bloch, a name that might be familiar to you.</p>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: He was then at the mission in West Berlin, and was given the job of
                    working out the practical arrangements for the opening of the embassy, in terms
                    of finding office premises and accommodations, settling details of privileges
                    and immunities, that sort of thing. And I'd go with him occasionally to meet
                    with the East Germans to make these arrangements.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Oh yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the affect? These are urban, home grown urban
                        terrorists.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: During the time I was in Berlin, there was the famous kidnapping of the
                    president of the Berlin house of representatives, Peter Lorenz. He was held for
                    about 4 or 5 days, maybe a week, and then released unharmed. I'm not sure
                    whether ransom money was paid or not, or whether there was some quid pro quo.
                    There was certainly a Bader-Meinhof presence in Berlin. Whenever our ambassador
                    was in town he would have a Berlin police escort, and I think the minister did
                    as well. The Amerika Haus, which was in the center of town, was a target of some
                    minor low-level terrorism while I was there. The Mission proper was on the

                        What was it like there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Going over to East Berlin got to be a routine for me. The U.S. military
                    had very strict rules about how you were supposed to handle yourself going
                    through Checkpoint Charlie, perhaps necessary for the average serviceman doing
                    it for the first time but somewhat overkill for those of us crossing over all
                    the time. The rule was not to roll down your car window at all but simply
                    display in the window our flag card, as it was known, and allow the East German
                    policeman to take down the name. Because of my frequent crossings, I got to know
                    all the East German guards at the checkpoint. I'd roll down my window and chat
                    with them back and forth. It was pretty easy-going. Over there in East Berlin,
                    it was a different world obviously. The place smelled different, partly because
                    of the soft brown coal that the East Germans used for heating and power
                    generation. The smell would often blow over into West Berlin too. Obviously
                    things looked very different in East Berlin: the way people dressed, the way
                    they behaved, the paucity of. cars in the streets, the goods in the stores. It
                    was almost a totally different world.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: In those days we didn't travel much in the GDR except to use the
                    autobahn to go west to Helmstedt. I must have done that a dozen times. It wasn't
                    a very good road, but you could cover the distance in a couple of hours. We did
                    make provision to attend the annual spring fair in Leipzig. In order to avoid
                    the complication of having an East German visa in a diplomatic passpora
                    theological faux pas in the days before recognition of the GDwe worked it out
                    through the Soviets for the East Germans to give us the visa on a separate sheet
                    of paper. That kept us theologically sound. We would enter the GDR directly from
                    West Berlin, bypassing East Berlin and thus avoiding further theological
                    complications. Most of us who made the trip didn't spend much time at the fair;
                    we traveled around Leipzig and the surrounding area, trying to figure out what
                    was going on, talking with the local citizenry, etc. I took a bus trip down to
                    Dresden and was regaled by the tour guides with tales of the destruction Allied
                    bombings had wroughwhich was still plainly visible. In 1975 I crossed over the
                    GDR on the way to Poland and then back from Czechoslovakia.</p>

                <p>CHAPMAN: I came back to Washington and worked a year on the Secretariat Staff.
                    This was basically support work, doing some travel with the Secretary, initially
                    Kissinger and then Vance. I got to a few places I'd never been to beforAfrica

                <p>CHAPMAN: It was instructive dealing with two very different secretaries, who ran
                    the Department in very different ways. Kissinger had his own style, his own way
                    of running the Department. Vance had a very different way of doing it.</p>

                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: This was just three years after the Turkish invasion of 74.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: July of 1974.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: One of the key issues in my first year on the desk was the lifting of
                    the embargo that Congress had imposed on arms sales to Turkey as a result of the
                    invasion on Cyprus. The Turks made it clear they would not cooperate on Cyprus
                    at all until that embargo was lifted, and the embargo was hurting bilateral
                    relations with Turkey and undermining the security of NATO's southern flank. So
                    the Carter Administration, which had come into office with a pledge to the
                    Greek-American community to work to resolve the Cyprus dispute, decided to press
                    Congress to lift the embargo. But to accomplish this we had to demonstrate a
                    certain amount of progress on Cyprus, which was not easy to do at that juncture.
                    Vance had named Matt Nimetz, then counselor of the Department, to be his spear
                    carrier on Cyprus. Much of the time I worked directly for him rather than for
                    the assistant secretary in EUR, traveling with him literally countless times to
                    consult with UN officials in New York. Formally speaking, Cyprus was an issue
                    for the UN rather that the U.S. directly, and we had to keep it within that
                    framework even though people recognized that the U.S. was the prime motive
                    power. So Matt Nimetz would be in frequent contact with Waldheim and Brian
                    Urquhart, the undersecretary for political affairs, to exchange ideas and try to
                    get things moving. Makarios died literally as I came onto the desk. So my first
                    task was to prepare all kinds of briefing papers for the U.S. delegation to
                    Makarios' funeral, on subjects that at that point I knew precious little about.
                    Makarios had been such a forceful and authoritative figure in Cyprus, and
                    unfortunately his successor was a very cautious politician who simply did not
                    have the clout or the daring to take any bold initiatives to try and resolve the
                    Cyprus issue. This made it very hard to come up with any progress that would
                    justify the lifting of the embargo or prove that correct after the fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the embargo of arms to Turkey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes. The resolution to lift the embargo passed by the narrowest of
                    margins in the House, by just one or two votes as I recall. Obviously the
                    Greek-American community and its supporters on the Hill were adamantly opposed.
                    I remember getting lectured to by Sarbanes and Congressman Brademas of
                    Indiana.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Indiana. Both of Greek, Greek-Americans.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: They were the key figures. During my second year on the desk, in
                    recognition of the fact the embargo had been lifted, we got more involved in the
                    substance of the Cyprus issue. While respecting the UN role, we came up with our
                    plan for a Cyprus settlement in the fall of '7labeling this a set of ideas
                    rather than a plan as such. I worked intensively on this under Matt Nimetz's
                    guidance, and we then tried to sell it to the various parties concerned. We went
                    up to New York to meet, separately, with the president of the Cyprus House of
                    Representativein lieu of President Kyprianoand the leader of the Turkish Cypriot
                    community, Rauf Denktash.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think Tashnu is the other one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Denktash later proclaimed himself president of the TRNC [Turkish
                    Republic of Northern Cyprus], but as of 1978 the Turkish Cypriots had not
                    formally declared themselves an independent entity. The Greek Cypriots were
                    initially non-committal as to our plan, hoping that Denktash would reject it and
                    thus spare them criticism. As it turned out, Denktash rejected the plan out of
                    hand, noting that he felt much like Churchill who, after hearing the news of a
                    severe military defeat, called for a tall glass of Scotch to revive him. The
                    Turkish Ambassador to the UN had invited us to lunch with Denktash afterwards,
                    and given Denktash's reaction to our plan it turned out to be a glum affair. We
                    were at a Japanese restaurant, the sort where you sit on the floor with your
                    legs under a low table. Denktash, a former wrestler, was a very rotund
                    individual, and after lunch he couldn't get up from under the table, so Nimetz,
                    the Turkish Ambassador and I had to grab him by the arms and the neck and pull
                    him up and out. Ultimately our plan didn't resolve anything, although it perhaps
                    injected a number of new ideas into the process. I recall a UN secretariat
                    official telling me some five or six years later that this was the best plan he
                    thought anybody could come up with for a bizonal, bicommunal Cyprus. Personally
                    I felt it fascinating to get directly and deeply involved in something like
                    this, helping write a constitution for another country and contributing to
                    overcoming decades of mutual hostility. And it was quite an experience to be
                    with Nimetz while he tried to sell presidents and foreign ministers on these
                    ideas.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Oh yes. Their basic view was that we were pro-Turkish and had no
                    understanding or recognition of all that the Greek Cypriots had suffered. We
                    certainly did recognize what thousands of Greek Cypriots had gone through in
                    losing their homes and properties and being forced to live in refugee camps. My
                    recollection is that the Greek-American community was not helpful at all in
                    terms of trying to come up with any kind of solution that might be acceptable to
                    both sides. In many ways they were more hard-line that the Greek Cypriots
                    themselves in refusing to budge from maximal demands. They insisted that we
                    should not be dealing with the Turkish Cypriots, but only with the Turks in
                    Ankara. They saw the Turks as controlling what was going on in Turkish Cyprus
                    and argued that if we put real pressure on the Turks they would relent and let
                    the Greek Cypriots come back to their properties and everything would be fine.
                    That to my mind was a major underestimation of how important Cyprus was for
                    Turkey in terms of protecting the interests of their kinsmen on the island and
                    of how obstinate the Turks can be when they really dig themselves in and how
                    they don't want to be seen as responding to overt American pressure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I never really got involved except on the periphery of
                        seeing the emotions there. I was Consul General in Athens in 1970-74. In
                        fact, I left early July '74. Anybody who looks at this as an American sort
                        of objectively can see that the Turkish Cypriots had a real cause. When
                        there was this coup and Sampson and others were put in the prisons. The real
                        thugs. The Greeks had really been nasty to the Turks. There was a
                        subservient peasantry and all that. So that the Turkish response of coming
                        in was if you were a Turk was quite justified. The Greeks I've seen
                        afterwards seem to forget all that. I mean they start as though all of a
                        sudden the Turks jumped on Cyprus for no particular cause.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes, you're right that lots of Greek-Americans believed that the crisis
                    began in 1974, ignoring all that had happened since 1963. And they recognized
                    that there had been a coup against Makarios on the part of more extreme Greek
                    Cypriots that produced anxiety among the Turkish Cypriots. But they argued that
                    that was no justification for the Turkish invasion, particularly the second
                    phase of it that brought about extensive loss of Greek Cypriot properties and
                    occupation by the Turkish army. You're right, there had been some very real
                    problems almost from the time of Cypriot independence in 1960, where the
                    minority Turkish Cypriots suffered discrimination, which often turned to
                    violence, at the hands of the Greek Cypriot majority. Under British rule the
                    Turkish Cypriots had been scattered over much of the island, but in the sixties
                    they tended to congregate in certain areas, some in the north and some in the
                    south, where they would be safer living together. But these incidents of
                    internal conflict continued to happen throughout the sixties, with a major
                    crisis in 1967. A lot of the EOKA extremists who had fought against British rule
                    now turned their attentions on the Turkish Cypriots. Many of them, like Nikos
                    Sampson, were real thugs. I remember Clerides, who was later president of
                    Cyprus, telling the story that he had Sampson as a next-door neighbor and that
                    one day while out gardening wearing a while shirt Sampson had come over to him
                    and said, quite out of the blue, “Whenever I see a white shirt, I see blood and
                    blood spreading.”</p>

                        had ousted the colonels. Could they even maneuver or do anything at that
                        point? Or were emotions so raw that there was nothing that they could
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: My recollection is that we engaged them, both here and in Athens. They
                    would argue the Greek Cypriot view point strongly, but would keep their distance
                    from the issue. They wanted to see Cyprus as essentially a Greek CypriotTurkish
                    dispute that they were not directly party to, although they generally backed the
                    Greek Cypriots strongly. This tied in with the notion that the Turkish Cypriots
                    were not an entity on their own but rather subservient to Turkey. The Greeks
                    were ready to help somewhat, but not in any big way.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much support did you get from the European Bureau? Did
                        they look upon you as the disreputable cousins or something like that. Two

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Well, we were an integral part of the European Bureau, and George Vest,
                    the assistant secretary at the time, was actively engaged. He probably saw the
                    Cypriot Ambassador as often as Nimetz did. Obviously this was a difficult issue
                    for the bureau to handle with two members of NATO, although the real issues that
                    divided Greece and Turkey were not Cyprus [end of tape]</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes, as I was saying, the real issues between the Greeks and the Turks
                    in that time were less Cyprus itself than Aegean issues — overflights,
                    demarcation lines in the Aegean, military incidents that had brought direct
                    friction between the two countries. And this from the NATO standpoint was the
                    real operational issue, how to get Greek and Turkish military forces to train
                    together and to be interoperable in support of NATO missions when they were at
                    loggerheads over demarcation, aerial and naval incidents, aircraft straying over
                    the border, buzzing incidents, that sort of thing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: We thought we had the solution but neither party would buy it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was, I mean, what was the shape of the solution?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The basis for an agreement was that there had to be two separated
                    communities. I think realistically the Greek Cypriots would have agreed to that
                    as well, that the experience of living together had not worked out so they had
                    to live separately. The issues boiled down to basically a constitution and
                    territory. The territorial issue was the more straightforward, in terms of
                    arriving at a percentage of the total island territory that the Greek Cypriots
                    would occupy and a percentage the Turkish Cypriots would occupy, taking into
                    account particular areas or locales that were of especial importance to one side
                    or the other. It was a matter of the Turkish Cypriots yielding territory, the
                    question being just how much. This was, in principle at least, a resolvable
                    issue, moving the boundary here a bit and there a bit. A complicating factor was
                    the Greek Cypriot demand for retention and free access to properties Greek
                    Cypriots formerly owned in the north. The constitutional issue was more
                    difficult: we proposed a confederal structure where many local powers and
                    responsibilities would have resided with the two communities and the common
                    government would have been responsible for foreign affairs, defense and the
                    like. In essence, the Turkish Cypriots wanted less of a central government and
                    more local control, and greater representation in the central government than
                    their proportion of the overall population would in theory allow. The Greek
                    Cypriots wanted a more robust central government that would mirror their
                    majority status in the island as a whole so they could effectively control
                    developments in the island. We came up with a formula that sought to split these
                    differences, with a national assembly largely proportionally elected, a rotating
                    presidency, and adequate protection for minority rights.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>One argument we tried to make to the Greek Cypriots all along was why not let
                    some system like this come into being; over time, being economically stronger,
                    better educated, more populous, they would come to dominate the affairs of
                    Cyprus, certainly economically. Why bother, why haggle, why hassle over all the
                    fine details of the constitution if over the long run you will clearly dominate
                    the country? But they didn't buy that. They were so hung up on restoring the
                    status quo ante. The Greek Cypriot government was of course under heavy pressure
                    from the refugee organizations, representing Greek Cypriots who had been forced
                    out of their homes in the north and would settle for nothing less than returning
                    to them. A lot of these refugees quite deliberately refused to integrate with
                    the rest of Greek Cyprus, which they could easily have done, and instead
                    maintained a refugee status. The U.S. taxpayer funded quite luxurious housing
                    for them; they by no means lived in what one normally would conceive to be
                    refugee camps. The refugees were a very powerful lobby and no Greek Cypriot
                    president or other leading politician could afford to ignore them, and their
                    demands were absolute. So Greek Cypriot flexibility and ability to compromise
                    was circumscribed from the word go.</p>

                <p>Today is April 1st, April Fool's Day, 2005. Geoff, we're covering 1979 to '81 and
                    you're in Political Military. What piece of the Political Military action did
                    you have?</p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I was in the office that dealt with arms control and specifically
                    strategic arms control. This was just after the SALT II (Strategic Arms
                    Limitation Treaty) treaty had been signed and had gone to the Hill for
                    ratification. I was brought in specifically to begin working on what we
                    optimistically in those days called SALT III, so as to be ahead of the curve
                    after SALT II had been ratified, as we then fully expected would be the case.
                    There was an understanding with the Soviets at the time that we would move on to
                    SALT III rapidly after SALT II had gone into effect. That turned out, obviously,
                    not to be the case. For the first three months or so in PM I was actually drawn
                    into the SALT II ratification effort, producing position papers and talking
                    points and drafting letters and that kind of thing. Of course all of this ground
                    to a halt in December of '79 when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan and President
                    Carter withdrew the treaty from consideration in the Senate. And the issue then
                    was, for me personally, what happens next? I was brought in to deal with SALT
                    and here SALT II was clearly on its death bed, and obviously we weren't going
                    anywhere with SALT III. So for the remainder of the Carter administration I was
                    involved with various other arms control efforts that were still going on, which
                    were few and far between since we'd essentially abandoned all bilateral arms
                    control. But there were multilateral arms control talks that were still going on
                    mostly under the aegis of the United Nations, the Indian Ocean Zone of Peace
                    being one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, you were in a bureau that was dealing with
                        military affairs and while it wasn't your piece of the pie, what were you
                        getting from your colleagues about why the hell the Soviets went into
                        Afghanistan? It's never been quite clear to me.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I don't think we really discussed that much in PM. Later when I got into
                    the Soviet field I began to think about that more clearly, more fully. My
                    thinking at the time was that it was a fairly straightforward case of the
                    Soviets' belief that if a communist regime had been installed through Soviet
                    influence—as all had been except for the Soviet Union of course—then the fall of
                    one such regime would initiate a sort of a domino effect for the Soviet empire
                    and ultimately threaten the USSR itself. For that reason the Soviets,
                    recognizing that there was or had been unrest in parts of Eastern Europe, were
                    concerned that this might recur and for that reason all the more intent on
                    holding on to every bit and piece of the Soviet empire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little about the Zone of Peace in the
                        Indian Ocean because this is something I think I've heard vaguely about but
                        what was this concept?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I've conveniently forgotten practically everything about it. My
                    recollection is it was something that was pushed by the non-aligned and was
                    designed to keep any American naval vessels that might be carrying nuclear
                    weapons out of the Indian Ocean. We entered into the negotiation with the intent
                    of negating this design and redirecting the concept in ways that would not harm
                    our interests, while seeking to curry some kind of favor with the non-aligned by
                    the fact of our participation. I don't remember whether the idea really got
                    anywhere; I'm sure it didn't in the course of the sort of year or so that I was
                    peripherally involved in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just one of those almost amorphous things that was there
                        but not particularly- no one really cared- in other words, we didn't have a
                        strong feeling one way or the other except to make sure it didn't preclude
                        us from sailing our ships through the area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Right. There were numerous such arms control and disarmament efforts
                    which were launched through the United Nations by other countries for obvious
                    political reasons, trying to restrict our freedom of maneuver. In most of these
                    cases we were in a defensive mode trying either to defeat proposals completely
                    or draw the fangs from them so they would have no practical implications.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well in '81 where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: In early '81, at the start of the Reagan administration, there was
                    something of a hiatus for the office I was in: here we were an arms control
                    office and there was real doubt whether there would be any arms control in the
                    Reagan administration. The folks in the Pentagon, my recollection is, initially
                    dismissed it entirely, this wasn't a concern of theirs. But there were some
                    people in the State Department who recognized that we could not as a practical
                    matter abandon arms control entirely, and acknowledged that it might have some
                    concrete benefit for U.S. security. One of these people was the new director of
                    the Political-Military Bureau, Richard Burt, who had a reputation as a
                    conservative defense intellectual. But Burt was not that far out on the right
                    wing, and he had a realistic notion of America's place in the world and the need
                    for us to remain engaged internationally. This required, among other things, a
                    well thought-out arms control policy. But he had an uphill fight convincing the
                    White House and the Pentagon of this. Around March or April arms control
                    supporters in the Congress began to get concerned as to whether the new
                    administration would indeed continue with arms control, and hearings were called
                    on the subject. Many in the administration were uncertain how to react to the
                    request, but Burt stepped forward and arranged for Walter Stoessel, the new
                    undersecretary for political affairs, to testify as the principal administration
                    witness. I ended up drafting a broad-brush opening statement for Stoessel, under
                    Burt's guidance, that we sort of cleared around a largely disinterested
                    interagency community. The hearing itself was dominated on the administration
                    side by Burt, who sought to make the case that the Reagan administration was
                    going to observe some continuity, was going to have an arms control policy, and
                    wasn't simply going to throw overboard everything that had been achieved in the
                    area.</p>
                <p>In the spring of '81 I received an assignment to Moscow for the summer of '82 via
                    Russian language training. I was due to start this in September, but because I
                    had taken some early-morning Russian language training a few years earlier and
                    already had a tested 2/2 in the language, the powers that be at FSI decided
                    literally two days before classes were to begin that I could not start until
                    January. So I had to find something else to do for the next three or four
                    months. Fortunately a position had just come open in EUR in the office of
                    regional political-military affairs, in the section of the office that dealt
                    with INF — Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces. This was largely the deployment
                    rather than the arms control dimension of the INF issue.</p>

                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes. There was the so-called dual-track decision which was taken by the
                    NATO alliance in 1979, during the Carter administration, to try to counter the
                    SS-20 threat. It was essentially the Europeans who made the case that we needed
                    to respond to the SS-20 threat, and the response agreed upon was both to seek an
                    arms control solution and at the same time to build up a comparable force on
                    European soil that could serve to deter a Soviet use of the SS-20 or could be
                    used as a bargaining chip in negotiations. In the fall of 1981 I was involved in
                    trying to smooth the way for the basing of new U.S. INF missiles in Europe. At
                    that particular point we had basically reached agreement with Bonn on planned
                    deployments on German soil, and with the UK, but more work needed to be done
                    with Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands. I recall being focused mainly on Italy,
                    where the issue was finding a temporary site for basing cruise missiles for the
                    four to five years that it would take to construct a permanent base. We and the
                    Italians agreed on using the existing naval air station at Sigonella for this
                    purpose, but the Italians had a lot of work to do to overcome local opposition
                    in Sicily. After three months in this interim assignment I then did Russian
                    language training from January through July of 1982.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you went where? To Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: To Moscow, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe the state of our relations with the
                        Soviets the summer of '82 when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Relations were not as bad as they became a little later on. We were
                    engaged with the Soviet bilaterally, and various arms control negotiations were
                    in progress. Still, there was obviously a lot of tension. Afghanistan was still
                    a major sticking point so it was not a very easy relationship. It was a
                    difficult time for an American diplomat working in Moscow. We were dealing a
                    closed society, and our ability to make professional contacts and to produce
                    useful information were necessarily limited. During my first year in Moscow I
                    served as the publications procurement officer, which was a great job in many
                    ways because it got me to travel throughout the Soviet Union. There were of
                    course extensive travel restrictions imposed by the Soviets, but we could travel
                    to fairly large areas of the Russian Republic and Ukraine and to the capitals of
                    the other constituent republics of the Soviet Union. In my three years in Moscow
                    I traveled to all 15 republics at least once — in Central Asia, the Caucasus,
                    the Baltics — as well as fairly extensively in Russia itself. Basically the job
                    involved working for the agency in Langley trying to come up with all kinds of
                    publications that are not normally available outside of the Soviet Union that
                    might give them a better picture on what's going on there.</p>

                        bookstore in Bishkek or something when you arrived there? I mean, you must
                        have- everybody knew what you were doing. I mean, how were you received and
                        how about buying these books?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: It varied tremendously. I don't think the center issued orders to the
                    republics not to allow me in the bookstores. I remember encountering no problems
                    in initial trips to the BalticI was free to wander through the bookstores and
                    buy what I wanted. Sometimes there was virtually nothing worth buying; other
                    times I would come out with stacks of books. The I went down to Kiev and started
                    shopping in a large bookstore very near to the hotel I was staying at. I was
                    there all of ten minutes when an assistant came by and told me that the store
                    was closing to take inventory. And this ten minutes after the store opened.
                    Obviously it was a ruse to get me and the colleague I was traveling with out of
                    the store. I went to other stores in the Soviet Union where they would have most
                    of the store cordoned off, so I could only go to the children's book section for
                    example. I'd find other stores closed down, doubtless timed to my arrival, with
                    a sign on the door announcing that an inventory was in progress but obviously
                    nothing of the sort going on. In one particular store in Akhshabad in
                    Turkmenistan I plunked a stack of books on the counter only for the clerk to
                    tell me that all except three or four were reserved for specialists and that she
                    would not sell them to me. So it wasn't exactly a free and open buying
                    experience.</p>

                        go look in animal husbandry. And there was the book Animal Farm. Those in
                        the know were having George Orwell's book, you know, satire on communism and
                        having-</hi>

                        harassed by the KGB or did blonde provocateurs come at you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: To some extent. There was an embassy rule that employees could not
                    travel alone in the Soviet Union, and often I would travel with an agency
                    representative who was on paper assigned as my deputy. Since the Soviets were on
                    to his affiliation, we were shadowed by the KGB everywhere, most of the time
                    very blatantly and obviously. They were there at the airport when we arrived,
                    and would practically wave to us in greeting. One always felt very safe because
                    there was very little street crime at that time and in any event you could be
                    sure that these goons would step in to protect you if something did happen. As
                    to provocation, my colleague and I were having dinner together in a hotel
                    restaurant in Kiev and all of a sudden these two young blondes showed up and sat
                    down at our table and started engaging us in conversation. But that was all; I
                    was somewhat disappointed in fact that they didn't try anything further. In
                    several out-of-the-way places, where foreigners were a rarity, I was asked by
                    policemen to show them my papers; normally they were satisfied after a glance at
                    my diplomatic ID card. But that wasn't really harassment. There were other
                    instances where I was in a restaurant and would be befriended by other diners,
                    who would invite me to their homes for a drink a drink. I took up these
                    invitations a couple of times and nothing came of them. The security people
                    would doubtless have been outraged at such visits, but I saw them as
                    opportunities to learn more about local conditions and get ordinary Russians to
                    express their views. I'm not sure whether these were intended provocations; many
                    of these encounters took place in provincial towns far from the center where
                    foreigners rarely ventured, and the authorities might simply not have warned
                    citizens to stay away from foreigners. Who knows? I get the impression that the
                    society at that time was not as closed and as regimented as we night have
                    thought. The police state was not as thoroughgoing in those days as it had been
                    during the days of Stalin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, were you there during the period of
                        demise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With Brezhnev?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Well, Brezhnev died-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chernenko and then Andropov.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The other way around, Andropov and then Chernenko. Brezhnev died in
                    November of '82, just shortly after I arrived in Moscow. This was the first time
                    since Stalin that a Soviet leader had died in office, so no one really knew what
                    was going to happen and ostensibly there was no succession arranged beforehand.
                    During my second and third years in Moscow I was the head of the internal
                    political unit in the embassy so I got directly involved in leadership issues.
                    Both Andropov and Chernenko were sick men when they came into office, and we
                    spent a lot of time trying to track their medical condition over the less than a
                    year and a half that Andropov was in office and barely a year that Chernenko was
                    in office. One thing that I started doing was to try to track leadership
                    motorcades, trying to determine who was coming to work and who was staying ill
                    in the dacha. Police would close down the main streets when the General
                    Secretary's motorcade came along and everybody would scatter from the sidewalks.
                    And I remember the first time I did this, trying to check whether Andropov who
                    was coming to work, I stationed myself near the Central Committee building and
                    then noticed that the crowds had suddenly disappeared from the streets. I was
                    the only person standing there. And afterwards I thought that probably there
                    were marksmen with their rifles trained on me in case I was some security
                    threat. The motorcade rumbled by, I actually got a glimpse of Andropov in the
                    back seat so I reported back that he was at least going to work. But it was
                    things like that we had to resort to to try and determine what was going on and
                    who was still in charge.</p>
                <p>It was a time where our sources of information were few and far between. We had
                    fairly ready access during the Andropov years to Roy Medvedev, the historian who
                    was an authority on Stalin, and who considered himself to be a true Leninist. He
                    was harassed during the Chernenko years so access to him was a little more
                    difficult. We could not go to his apartment but he could come to ours without
                    hindrance, which leaves you wondering about the efficiency of the system if
                    indeed the Chernenko people were out to silence him. He still had a good range
                    of contacts and provided us with some solid information. We had periodic access
                    to the editor of a journal called Kommunist, which was an official party organ.
                    This editor was a member of the Central Committee and very circumspect. He would
                    not come out and say things in a direct and clear cut manner. It was all hints,
                    suggestions, nuances here and there; and you had to learn how to interpret and
                    make use of these. We also had a useful KGB contact that my predecessor and I
                    had been introduced to, part of, as we subsequently learned, a KGB effort to
                    have a direct channel to the embassy should they at some point need one. I would
                    generally meet with him once a month over lunch. He never spoke a word of
                    English in my presence, although he claimed to read Time magazine faithfully
                    every week. He maintained that he worked for the State Committee on Science and
                    Technology, which was obviously not true given his openness in discussing Soviet
                    internal politics with a foreign diplomat, his dress, his demeanor, and the fact
                    that he read Time regularly. Later on, he was tied up with an espionage scandal
                    involving some Marines at the embassy in Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Sergeant Lonetree.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes. The man who was known to the Marines as Uncle Sasha I knew as
                    Alexei Yefimov. During the time I knew him he never sought any information from
                    me about the embassy. He rarely asked questions about U.S. policy that I
                    couldn't answer quite openly and he would provide a few indispensable nuggets of
                    information here and there. He gave me a tip-off on Chernenko's death before it
                    was announced, calling me at my apartment over a weekend, which was highly
                    unusual. It was very strange to learn afterwards that sometime after I left he
                    was given the added task of trying to suborn some Marines in order to get access
                    to classified premises in the embassy. It was hard to believe that the KGB would
                    have a single agent performing two very different roles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there the feeling or concern that with, you
                        know, Brezhnev going basically senile in office and then Chernenko
                        practically had to be propped up right from the beginning, I mean, you know,
                        you felt sorry when you see the man there, when he was talking, I mean,
                        obviously he had a hard time, even at death's door.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then Andropov seemed almost, although the KGB
                        connections seemed like a breath of fresh air until you found out he was on
                        dialysis most of the time. But was there a concern that the leadership at
                        the top was, well terribly weak because of this and this meant it was
                        unpredictable and you know, and when you have something like this it can get
                        scary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I think in the case of Brezhnev, yes, we all recognized that he wasn't
                    any longer capable of exercising the functions of his office. Like Chernenko
                    later on he was trotted out and propped up as a symbol of the regime to make the
                    case that it was still in existence and still functioning. This was a time when
                    as people recognized even of stagnation in the country. The Soviet economy was
                    stagnating, there was little effective leadership, and everybody recognized the
                    need for change. Andropov, who succeeded Brezhnev, was considered a breath of
                    fresh air.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chernenko, I mean Andropov who succeeded Chernenko..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: No, Andropov succeeded Brezhnev.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I'm sorry, okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Andropov was not a career KGB officer, but had worked his way up through
                    the ranks of the communist party and was a party leader. In the spring of '82 he
                    moved from the KGB to the Central Committee as one of the senior party
                    secretaries. Andropov when he came into power recognized full well that the
                    economy needed some kind of a push, some kind of a boost; but rather than
                    actually reform the system, he sought to give it this boost by introducing
                    greater discipline, insisting that people work harder and cut back on drinking,
                    which obviously was a major problem causing economic losses as well as health
                    problems. So there was a huge campaign to cut back on drinking and a huge
                    campaign for more discipline at the workplace. There was nothing as I recall in
                    the way of real incentives; just a focus on getting people to work on time,
                    sober, and have them do their job. Andropov also sought to reduce the so-called
                    gray economy that existed alongside the official state-run economy. People would
                    work in their off-duty hours and on weekends on what were essentially private
                    projects, earning real wages, but they would steal materials from their
                    workplace. So there was an attempt to crackdown on this theft. This petered out
                    as Andropov got progressively more and more sick and by the time he died then in
                    early '84, the program had pretty much ground to a halt.</p>
                <p>Chernenko was the last gasp of the old guard. It was well known at the time that
                    Gorbachev was Andropov's favorite to succeed him, but the old guard asserted
                    itself one more time. Gorbachev was recognized effectively as the second
                    secretary behind the general secretary, and for much of Chernenko's tenure in
                    fact Gorbachev chaired the Politburo and ran the Central Committee apparatus
                    because Chernenko was in no condition to do that. The old guard did not yield
                    easily, however. Viktor Grishin, who headed the Moscow city party apparatus,
                    engineered several of these Chernenko appearances on television where the
                    General Secretary was literally propped up and obliged to mumble through some
                    remarks. This only served to emphasize how frail Chernenko was, but Grishin's
                    purpose was by association to get across the point that he was the legitimate
                    successor to Chernenko's mantle.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>When Chernenko finally expired all the cards were essentially in place for
                    Gorbachev. During Chernenko's final months we in the Moscow embassy had an
                    interesting dialogue — perhaps a euphemistic word for it — with analysts back
                    here in INR (Bureau of Intelligence and Research) and in the CIA because my
                    conviction and that of my colleagues was that Gorbachev would be the successor;
                    all the indications that we saw and all the information we were picking up from
                    the few sources we had was that this was going to be the case. Some of the old
                    Soviet hands in INR and in the agency disagreed with that and somehow stories
                    were circulating that Gromyko wanted to make himself general secretary on
                    Chernenko's death. As it turned out Gromyko was the man who in fact pushed
                    Gorbachev forward, who formally endorsed Gorbachev as the successor at the
                    crucial Politburo and Central Committee meetings upon Chernenko's death. People
                    had limited expectations of Gorbachev back then. Early on he shook up the
                    Politburo, brought in his allies, some of whom later turned against him, such as
                    Ligachev. He made clear that he intended to take charge, but there were no
                    indications back then that we would soon see the flowering of Glasnost and
                    Perestroika. Those terms weren't around back then when Gorbachev took charge in
                    March of 1985. It was clear that he intended to pick up sort of where Andropov
                    had left off and try to revitalize the Soviet economy; but it was equally clear
                    that he had no intent at the start to change the structure of the economy or end
                    the dominance of the communist party. There would be efforts to make the economy
                    more productive, to get more work out of the average working man. In addition
                    there might be some loosening of controls, perhaps allowing elements of a market
                    economy to come into existence. But I left in July of 1985 and very little of
                    that had come to the fore by the time I left.</p>

                        But were you seeing the Soviet system internally, with all the weaknesses
                        that apparently Gorbachev at a certain point saw but I mean, but also 10
                        years later or less than that come out, the terrible state of the economy
                        and the nationality problem and all that. I mean, was that as apparent to us

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Well certainly the state of the economy was. Just by living there and
                    traveling around the country and talking to people, you could see that this was
                    an economy that was not producing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you just repeat that last part?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The Soviet economy was clearly in very poor condition just by all the
                    evidence you could see in Moscow, visiting other parts of the Soviet Union, and
                    talking to people; it was simply not producing the goods that people wanted and
                    needed. By this time, Soviet citizens were becoming more aware of what was
                    happening in the outside world. Russians were able to travel to parts of Eastern
                    Europe, not everybody but a sizeable number, and they could see that things were
                    so much better in Hungary and the German Democratic Republic and Poland than
                    they were in the Soviet Union. I think people were starting to question why this
                    was happening and whether a totally managed economy was in fact best for the
                    USSR.</p>
                <p>On the nationalities issue, there had been periodic sort of uprisings which had
                    been kept secret to a large extent by the Soviet leadership, happening in parts
                    of Central Asia and the Caucasus. Obviously you couldn't get people in these
                    areas to talk openly about how much they opposed the Soviet regime or the
                    communist party, but it was clear they didn't like the Russians and the Russians
                    were everywhere. The intent of the Soviet leadership was to push Russians out
                    into the periphery of the Soviet Union so they would in effect submerge the
                    other nationalities and would be able to run the other republics. Typically the
                    general secretaries of the republic parties were of the local nationality, but
                    the second secretary would invariably be a Russian who was essentially in
                    control of the ruling party apparatus. Some of the other republics were very
                    different from Russia. Outwardly there were similarities such as the same ugly
                    apartment blocks that were built in Tashkent or Tbilisi as in Moscow, but the
                    peoples and the cultures were so different. Georgia was in many respects almost
                    a Mediterranean country, not only with regard to the climate but the way people
                    behaved and their general openness. I remember having a wonderful five-hour-long
                    evening conversation with a Georgian philosopher in his home in Tbilisi. I had
                    been given his name by a colleague, and I just picked up the phone and called
                    him and he invited me over for supper right away. So we chatted, quite openly,
                    for about five hours. That couldn't have happened in Moscow I don't think.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I think that really nobody foresaw in 1985 that within five or six years
                    the Soviet Union would be gone. I think we saw it mellowing, modifying itself,
                    perhaps introducing elements of a free market economy. I don't think we foresaw
                    any sort of change in political structure, any change in the role of or
                    dominance of the communist party. And I don't think we foresaw any breakup of
                    the country.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about with the Reagan administration there and Ronald
                        Reagan had come in from the right wing of the Republican party and was
                        making remarks, you know, sort of off the campaign trail and all, you know,
                        about confrontation with the Soviet Union, was this a difficult period to
                        sort of explain to Soviet types or among ourselves at the embassy that, you
                        know, I mean, did we feel we were on an overly confrontational course with
                        the Soviet Union or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Well the phrase that really raised Soviet hackles was the term evil
                    empire. To my recollection Reagan had uttered the phrase before I got to the
                    Soviet Union so I wasn't in a position to gauge the immediate impact of it.
                    Certainly amongst Soviet officialdom and the contacts we had there was strong
                    opposition to what was seen as an effort by the Reagan administration simply to
                    build up American military might and to ignore any dialogue with the Soviet
                    Union aimed at reducing mutual threats and tensions. When I was out in the
                    provinces people would ask me about this or that Reagan administration policy
                    and challenge me to justify it. But it was not unusual to come across people who
                    had a certain admiration for the United States. There was a dichotomy in many
                    ordinary Soviets' minds between the American people and the American government:
                    an admiration of and respect for Americans, for our way of life, for our
                    entertainment industry, for the resilience and output of our economy, but a lack
                    of understanding oindeed outright opposition to — what the Reagan administration
                    was up to. Relations were by no means smooth during my first year in Moscow, but
                    they turned considerably worse after the shootdown of Korean Airlines Flight 007
                    in September 1983.</p>
                <p>The shootdown brought about a real freeze that didn't start to thaw until March
                    of 1985 when we resumed arms control negotiations in Geneva. But during those
                    eighteen months contacts were even more difficult than they had been before, and
                    it was very difficult to get any sense of what was going on behind the scenes in
                    the society and the party and the government. Although preparations for the
                    resumption of arms control negotiations were in progress during Chernenko's
                    watch, the coming of Gorbachev brought a sense of greater hope for U.S.-Soviet
                    relations. There was a feeling that things were getting back onto a more even
                    keel. But still I heard plenty of criticism of Reagan administration policies
                    during the spring of 1985 — the military build-up, the strategic defense
                    initiative, the deployment of intermediate range missiles in Europe where they
                    could reach Soviet soil.</p>

                        did somebody else have it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: An officer in my section was responsible for contacts with
                    dissidents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Jon Purnell and the George Glass. A lot of their contacts were with what
                    were called refuseniks, most of them Jewish, who had applied for emigration and
                    had been denied. Typically there were gatherings outside the main synagogue in
                    Moscow on Friday evenings, and Jon or George would go down there to pick up
                    information on individual refusenik and dissident cases. That is where we got
                    the information for our representations to the Soviet government on human rights
                    cases. We had indirect contact with Sakharov through his wife, Yelena Bonner,
                    whom we would visit at her Moscow apartment from time to time.</p>
                <p>There were other people on the dissident fringe whom we got to know, some quite
                    closely. It was impossible to have any real social relationship a foreign
                    ministry bureaucrat or anybody else in the Soviet apparatus. But people who were
                    on the dissident fringe, who were not labeled as enemies of the Soviet regime as
                    such but who had run afoul of the regime in some form or fashion and who had
                    lost their jobs, we quite amenable to friendship with foreigners. Some of these
                    people were strong religious believers. One particular individual that I got to
                    know was a strong Russian nationalist as well as a devout believer, a
                    mathematician who had been fired from his job and did manual labor helping
                    restore the Danilovsky Monastery, now the seat of the Russian Patriarchate,
                    while his wife held down a paying job. We would get to meet a lot of unofficial
                    artists. A lot of these people suspected, probably correctly, that the regime
                    was following what they were doing; but they figured that there was nothing for
                    them to lose.</p>
                <p>I got to know a Georgian sculptor through Alexei Yefimov, my KGB contact, and
                    spent many pleasant social hours with him and his wife. One evening I called on
                    the sculptor alone to find Yefimov also at the studio, and we spent several
                    hours over some excellent Georgian dishes discussing all manner of issues in a
                    way that was totally out of character for a Soviet official. I was openly
                    challenging the basis of communism and the Soviet regime, and he was quite
                    forthright and realistic in his replies. This was the one occasion I can
                    remember of having a genuine no-holds-barred intellectual discussion with a
                    Soviet official in which I was not simply fed the party line.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, who was the ambassador while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Arthur Hartman. You may have seen he was recently in the news with this
                    open letter opposing the Bolton nomination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I know. How did you work with him? I mean, was he a

                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Art Hartman was not a career Sovietologist and did not have fluent
                    Russian, in contrast to practically every other Foreign Service ambassador we've
                    had there. Largely because of the state of relations, he did not have easy
                    access to senior Soviet officials. But he built up close ties within the
                    diplomatic corps, both among western and eastern European ambassadors, and the
                    latter in particular were good sources of information. There was generally quite
                    a sense of camaraderie in the diplomatic corps in Moscow, extending to the
                    Chinese among others. My internal political unit would meet periodically with
                    our Chinese counterparts to exchange information; they were quite open and had
                    some useful insights to share. They would regal us with magnificent banquets at
                    the enormous Chinese embassy; we could reciprocate only with lasagna and salad
                    at the Embassy cafeteria or at an ordinary Russian restaurant.</p>
                <p>Hartman excelled in running the embassy and attracted some very good people.
                    Warren Zimmerman was DCM (deputy chief of mission) for the first couple of years
                    I was there, and then Curt Kamman, who had been the political counselor, moved
                    up to that slot.Q: You left Moscow in '85. Whither?</p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Bonn.</p>

                <p>CHAPMAN: Through '89.</p>

                <p>CHAPMAN: I went there as the head of the political military unit in Bonn and then
                    moved up after a year to be deputy political counselor. I got the assignment
                    through Rick Burt, whom I'd worked for in the PM bureau.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Burt was ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Burt arrived in Bonn in late summer of 1985. I had known his DCM, Jim
                    Dobbins, for a number of years as well. Frankly a lot of people had a hard time
                    working with Rick Burt, although I managed to get along with him reasonably
                    well.</p>
                <p>I: I've heard that when he came in he was sort of in a way busting up the old
                    German club and bringing some, I mean, at least I've heard people say he was
                    trying, you know, coming in with a different crew. And you, I mean-</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I guess I was one of them. Although I'd served in German affairs before,
                    I could hardly qualify as a charter member of the German club. I remember when I
                    got to Bonn that some people were murmuring that I had gotten the assignment
                    simply because I was one of Rick Burt's people, not because of my
                    qualifications, background, and experience. Jim Dobbins as I recall had not
                    served in Germany before but he was certainly very knowledgeable on the
                    international security issues that were a huge component of our relations with
                    the Germans at that time, as of course was Burt. Burt was still relatively young
                    and had his own ideas of how to run an embassy, and he did not have a smooth
                    relationship with the foreign minister at the time, Hans-Dietrich Genscher. On
                    the other hand, he had served as Assistant Secretary for European Affairs and
                    had good ties to the White House, and was effective at getting Embassy views
                    across in Washington. Frankly, I think that the German club had become too
                    inbred at that point, and that what Burt did was probably good for the
                    service.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely. Well, when you got there what was, with
                        political military, what was the issue? In the first place, had you gotten

                        Pershing missile, cruise missile thing, had that settled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: No. Negotiations had only resumed in March in a new three-part format of
                    strategic, intermediate range and space negotiations. The major decisions had
                    already been taken about the deployment of Pershing II and ground-launched
                    cruise missiles in Germany, but we were still in the process of implementing
                    those decisions. I was the co-chair with a German MOD counterpart of a working
                    group dealing with all the fine details of implementing the deployment
                    decisions. There was a tremendous amount of public opposition in Germany to the
                    deployments, and to counter that we had an active public diplomacy campaign. I
                    remember doing a tremendous amount of public speaking at the time. The Germans
                    loved to invite American diplomats to talk to local party organizations and
                    university groups, and a frequent tactic of theirs was to invite both an
                    American diplomat and a Soviet diplomat to the same session and have us both
                    speak, in the anticipation that we would be at odds with each other and then the
                    German hosts, mirroring the role the German government often saw for itself,
                    could step in a build bridges between us. Interestingly enough, it sometimes
                    turned out that the Soviet and I would agree and the Germans would take a
                    different position entirely. SDI was of course a big issue at the time because
                    the Europeans-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Strategic Defense Initiative.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes, the Strategic Defense Initiative. The Europeans and the Germans in
                    particular were just not convinced about its validity, viewing it not as a
                    defensive move but rather an effort to gain superiority over the Soviet Union,
                    effectively ratcheting tensions up even further. I myself was not a strong
                    believer in SDI but obviously I had to go out there and defend the policy and
                    argue for it, sometimes in solid left wing environments. But even in those
                    environments the discourse was always at a fairly rational level. There was
                    little in the way of invective, vituperation, or insults. It was all very much
                    on an intellectual plane. My experiences with the right wing in Germany were
                    somewhat different. During my second, third and fourth years in Bonn, when I was
                    deputy counselor, I worked closely with Dobbins and Burt on international
                    security issues. We had umpteen visits by Paul Nitze and other major
                    administration officials who came to consult with the Germans on arms control —
                    Mike Glitman, who was in charge of the INF component of the negotiations, and
                    John Tower, who was head of the START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty)
                    strategic side of the negotiations. I ended up doing a lot of speechwriting for
                    Burt on international security topics. This was tough assignment initially, but
                    after a while I got to learn his style and to anticipate his needs and thoughts.
                    There were definitely some rough angles in U.S.-Germany relations at that time,
                    a lot of this irritation stemming from what we saw as efforts by the foreign
                    ministry and Genscher personally to take what we thought was too much of an
                    equidistant position vis-�-vis the United States and the Soviet Union. Germany
                    was, after all, a NATO ally, and the expectation on our side was that they would
                    support us and work with us rather than trying to set themselves up as sort of a
                    third entity midway between the United States and the Soviet Union. This rubbed
                    a lot of people the wrong way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, how about Kohl? Where did he fit in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Kohl was instinctively more pro-American than Genscher, but Genscher
                    really ran the show in foreign policy. It was intriguing to watch as Washington,
                    thinking that the U.S. model of a powerful White House/NSC role in foreign
                    policy applied to Germany, would send somebody over to see Helmut Kohl and more
                    or less ask him to bring Genscher into line. But the German cabinet system did
                    not work that way. The answer was never satisfactory: Kohl would go on talking
                    and talking but you'd never get a very clear line out of him. There was no
                    chancellery apparatus that was any way as powerful as the NSC apparatus. The
                    chancellery foreign policy staff consisted mainly of diplomats seconded from the
                    Foreign Ministry whose careers largely depended on Hans-Dietrich Genscher.</p>

                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes. Horst Teltschik, who was the equivalent of our national security
                    advisor, was not a strong political figure. Kohl was a frequent interlocutor for
                    us, but the man who ran foreign policy was Genscher. The defense minister,
                    Manfred Woerner, did not play much of a foreign policy role. He was solidly
                    pro-American and enjoyed his contacts with the U.S., but within German
                    government circles he was not a dominating figure like Genscher was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did, how did, while you were there, how did the
                        confrontation work out as far as, you know, intermediate missiles? I mean,
                        was it more or less, reach an equilibrium or something or were- during the
                        four years you were there, were there lots of demonstrations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: U.S.-Soviet relations certainly improved considerably during the second
                    half of the '80s, coinciding with my time in Bonn. There were summit meetings
                    between Reagan and Gorbachev, and the INF treaty was concluded. Improvements in
                    superpower relations made for far fewer disagreements between us and the
                    Germans, who were very happy to see progress on INF in particular. With the zero
                    option adopted in the INF agreement, this meant that the Pershing IIs and
                    ground-launched cruise missiles would disappear from German soil, thus ending
                    the political difficulties that deployment had caused for the Kohl
                    administration.</p>
                <p>The zero option originated, incidentally, with the Pentagon and personally with
                    Richard Perle, who was generally seen as somewhat to the right of Genghis Khan.
                    It was purely a political ploy from the start. The Defense Department
                    essentially wanted to remove any pressure from the Europeans and others to adopt
                    a more forthcoming arms control posture so they pressed for adoption of the most
                    forthcoming arms control posture imaginable — elimination of the weapons on both
                    sides. But they reasoned that the Soviets would never accept zero, which meant
                    that our INF deployments could go ahead as planned. You would think that the
                    Europeans would accept the zero option as it would eliminate the Soviet threat
                    and cancel out deployments on European soil. But they opposed it on the grounds
                    that it was non-negotiable; the Soviets, they claimed, would never accept zero.
                    So the German position for many years was that we should try to negotiate
                    reductions down to a minimum level sufficient to deter Soviet use of the SS-20;
                    but that a zero option was not serious.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When we're talking about the zero option we're talking
                        about the intermediate ones, not the intercontinental.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes, right. But even with the elimination of this class of missiles, the
                    Germans still had concerns about the Soviet nuclear threat to Europe. Clearly
                    the SS-20s were their primary concern, but even with their elimination the
                    Germans, given their geographical position, were uniquely vulnerable within the
                    Alliance to shorter range Soviet missiles forward deployed in Eastern Europe. So
                    they put on a strong push for reducing or eliminating what were called
                    short-range nuclear weapons concomitant with acceptance of zero to zero in
                    intermediate range forces. Again this was area where there was a major asymmetry
                    between the Soviets and NATO, in that we had very few of these shorter range
                    systems — some older LANCE systems that went back I think to the late '60s or
                    early '70s but nothing that was modern and in the quantities the Soviets had in
                    Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned during this period you were there with
                        someone under the push of Genscher of Germany making a deal and sort of
                        opting out of NATO to be neutral and getting closer ties with East Germany
                        or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I don't think we had any concern at that time about Germany opting out
                    of NATO as such. That was never seen to be really in the cards. I think there
                    was a bit of concern about the Germans adopting more of a neutral stance. As I
                    mentioned, one of their hopes was to try and set themselves up as sort of a
                    third force between the Soviet Union and the United States and positioned to
                    help the two superpowers come together for the benefit of all humanity. We were
                    concerned when the Germans adopted this tack rather than behaving as we hoped
                    they would as stalwart members of the Western Alliance. This ran the risk, as we
                    saw it, of Germany adopting a more neutralist position on the issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>As to ties between West and East Germany, this gets into the reunification
                    question which, while historically ever-present, was starting to come to the
                    fore in the last year or so that I was in Bonn. The long-held West German
                    position on reunification, going back to the time of Brandt and Schmidt and Egon
                    Bahr, was that this was a long-term process that in many ways depended less on
                    overt moves to improve ties with the East German regime than on trying to open
                    up the GDR and to build up people-to-people ties, to construct a network of ties
                    between the two states in the expectation that, together with a new generation
                    in East Germany, this would bring about different political culture more attuned
                    to the West and accustomed to dealing with the West. This went back to the
                    slogan of “change through coming together” as coined by Brandt and Bahr: the
                    Quadripartite Agreement and the follow-on agreements between West Germany and
                    East Germany and between West Berlin and the GDR fitted very much into this
                    Brandt-Bahr concept. Increased visits between Germans on both sides of the
                    divide and increased cultural exchanges would serve to help build up this whole
                    network of ties. This continued to be the basic German approach through to the
                    time of Kohl and Genscher. If you asked the average politically-aware German in
                    the spring of 1989 for his views on reunification, he would have replied that
                    this was still a desirable goal that German politicians should keep in mind, but
                    that it was something for the distant future and would not be achieved in his
                    lifetime. At that point in time people had actually dropped the “re-” and were
                    talking about unification rather than reunification, recognizing that the two
                    parts of the country had been separated for so long and had grown apart, so that
                    you couldn't really speak of just bringing them back together again — they were
                    two different entities that had to be merged in a more complex process. With the
                    benefit of hindsight, we can now see that the Kohl government handled
                    unification too much as a reunification, in the belief that the two parts of the
                    country would easily meld back together again, and not enough as a unification,
                    implying a more long-term and thought-out process in which the real differences
                    between the two parts would have been taken fully into account.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Vernon Walters, who succeeded Rick Burt as ambassador in the spring of '89, was
                    much taken by the whole unification issue upon his arrival. So he asked the
                    political section to do an in-depth analysis of thinking in the Germany body
                    politic on the issue. Basically we came back with much the same answer that I've
                    just described, that people were talking about it and saw it as a desirable goal
                    but a long-term one that was not going to be achieved in their lifetimes.
                    Walters thought somewhat differently, sensing that more rapid change was in the
                    offing. And of course he was proved right. A couple of years later I asked
                    Walters why he was so far ahead of the rest of us in the spring of '89. He told
                    me that he had been encouraged to believe that German unification would soon be
                    a real possibility as a consequence of the Soviet decision to pull out of
                    Afghanistan and to cease propping up the communist regime there. He had felt
                    that this decision had immediate implications for Soviet policy in Eastern
                    Europe, in the sense that, once a decision had been taken to let one communist
                    regime fail, it would be harder politically to prop up deteriorating communist
                    regimes elsewhere. With the political and societal ferment brewing in 1989,
                    serious challenges were bound to come soon to communist regimes in Eastern
                    Europe. Putting down such challenges might require substantial application of
                    Soviet military force and would probably be a dubious proposition anyway; and it
                    would go directly counter to Gorbachev's policy of engagement and cooperation
                    with the West and with what he was trying to achieve domestically.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: One episode comes to mind from about February in '89. I was invited to
                    speak, again with a Soviet diplomat, in Bavaria, before a right wing
                    organization. The discussion got around to reunification, with the question
                    being posed to me as to what the U.S. had done recently to promote this. This
                    was at a time before reunification became a hot topic, and I essentially
                    answered with the standard U.S. position that we supported reunification but
                    that this was something that was a matter for the Germans themselves to decide,
                    as part of a political process between West and East Germans. This was not
                    something that the United States could instigate, and we weren't about to make a
                    huge push with the Russians or with the East Germans in favor of unification. We
                    would support reunification, indeed, but we were not about to get out in front
                    and lead. This response was met with a chorus of boos on the part of my
                    audience. One member of the audience maintained that by the terms of the 1954
                    conventions by which the FRG achieved full sovereignty the U.S. was obliged to
                    work actively to overturn the regime in East Germany and reunify the country,
                    not necessarily by brute military force but something close to this. Of course
                    the language of the conventions did not require anything like this, but simply
                    support for reunification. So my message did not get across very well and my
                    Soviet counterpart in fact got more applause than I did at the end of the

                <p>What about the Green Party? How did you see that at the time?</p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I don't think at the time anybody was particularly concerned about the
                    Greens. They were represented in the Bundestag, but they were few in number and
                    there was still a major conflict going on within the Greens between the Realists
                    and the Fundis, the Fundamentalists, for control of the party. The CDU-FDP
                    coalition was firmly entrenched, and if there was to be a change of government
                    what we saw as most likely was the FDP changing sides as it had done back in
                    1982-3 when Kohl came to power. It was considered highly unlikely that the SPD
                    could come to power on its own, and an alliance between the SPD and the Greens
                    viewed as out of the question. The Greens were an irritant but were not seen as
                    a potent political force. We had contacts with them, including with Joschka
                    Fischer, later foreign minister in the Schroeder government, but we didn't see
                    eye-to-eye on anything really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about France? What the German-French connection a
                        force that concerned us or we felt was great or how did we view that during
                        the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: There was obviously a very close relationship between Kohl and
                    Mitterrand and the two governments worked very closely together. They prided
                    themselves as the engine of the European community. But there were areas of
                    friction, on a practical level, in the Franco-German relationship. One such area
                    had to do with the deployment of French forces in Germany: the French, much like
                    us and the British, chafed under the increasing tight restrictions that the
                    Germans tried to impose on troop and low level flying. This got to the point
                    where much of the training for U.S. air force units stationed in Germany was
                    conducted in British airspace, not over the territory that those units would be
                    called upon to defend in the event of hostilities with the East. The French with
                    their own nuclear force de frappe remained largely aloof from of what was going
                    on in the arms control arena out of concern that if they got too engaged their
                    own forces would be brought into the equation somehow; this didn't always sit
                    very well with the Germans. Of course as you move up higher in the political
                    hierarchy on both sides and addressed issues of European policy and European
                    unity, the disagreements at a lower level were papered over. There was this
                    tremendous belief on both sides that they had to do all they could politically
                    to ensure that Franco-German disagreements not return to the level they had
                    during the first half of the 20th century and that the two countries work in
                    unison. My own feeling at the time was that this was something the Germans
                    wholeheartedly embraced that but it seemed to go somewhat against the grain for
                    the French, who had always prided themselves on their national independence,
                    independent foreign policy, and independent military and nuclear policy. Perhaps
                    the French felt that they could better contain the Germans within a more unified
                    European structure, and that folding them completely into Europe would prevent
                    any future German aggression. Perhaps the Germans felt that given their size and
                    economic strength they could effectively dominate a unified Europe and spread
                    their political influence that way. They managed to work together, even though
                    their ultimate aims may have been different.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, did you see any shift in the
                        situation in East Germany at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Not to my recollection. Erich Honecker was a quintessential a hard-liner
                    and a resolute supporter of the Soviet Union, and had very little or no
                    tolerance for internal dissent. He sought to control the unrest and ferment that
                    were beginning to swirl within East German society, particularly in the
                    churches, but with limited success. Actually, my impression from what limited
                    travel I had done in the GDR was that the society was not as tightly controlled
                    and regimented as some in the west would have believed. I remember getting into
                    discussion when I was in Berlin in the early '70s as how to characterize the
                    East German regime. There some in the mission in Berlin at that time who simply
                    characterized it as a dictatorship, but my own view was that it was more of an
                    authoritarian than a totalitarian dictatorial society. It certainly was not a
                    totalitarian society the way Nazi Germany was. The political process, right up
                    until the downfall of the regime, was controlled by the communist party; but
                    rigid controls did not seep down that deeply and were not all-pervasive. East
                    Germany was economically the showcase of Eastern Europe, although when you went
                    over from West Berlin to East Berlin the contrast could not be more marked. But
                    compared to Poland, Rumania and certainly the Soviet Union, the East Germans
                    were economically well off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, I mean as just recently having been a Soviet
                        hand, what were you, how are you seeing the Gorbachev thing? Were you seeing
                        that, you know, we've got to get ready for real changes or how were you
                        doing, what you were getting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I continued to follow events in the Soviet Union fairly closely for at
                    least two or three years after I left Moscow. My sense was that in the '85-'86,
                    early '87 timeframe Gorbachev was continuing to build his strength within the
                    party and the bureaucratic apparatus and to put his stamp on Soviet society and
                    policy; but there were fairly clear indications that he was not having his own
                    way entirely, that there was a fair amount of internal opposition within the
                    party to what he was trying to do. His opponents feared that any opening up of
                    the society would jeopardize their and the party's dominant position, that it
                    would be very hard to put a stop to reform when things went too far. I think a
                    bit of caution on our part was justified at the time. Although perestroika and
                    glasnost were the watchwords of the moment, and the Soviets were taking a more
                    pragmatic and cooperative tack internationally, this did not mean that
                    Gorbachev's ultimate success was assured or that U.S. and Soviet goals in
                    international affairs were converging. The hardliners in Moscow could still
                    influence policy. Their sway diminished as the years went by, but the events of
                    1990 proved that there was still life in them. Moreover, even in the late 80's
                    Gorbachev's foreign policy aims were by no means identical with our own.</p>

                <p>CHAPMAN: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm told that people came out and talked, were making
                        presentations about how the split between East and West Germany was going to
                        be there for a long time and in November practically.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: By my recollection the sense in Bonn, both in the government and in the
                    political class generally, was that the division between the two German states
                    would continue for many more years. I don't think anybody really had any inkling
                    that things would happen so fast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one last question on this topic. When you were
                        talking to, I assume you would talk from time to time to British, I mean
                        German Foreign Service officers and all, did you find them at all restive
                        under Genscher?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Restive?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean, you know, feeling that, I mean, did there
                        seem to be a separate course or were they both disciplined and seemed to go
                        along with how Genscher was running foreign policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: German diplomats generally recognized that Genscher was a very powerful
                    figure in the government and was very much in charge of foreign policy, and that
                    this accordingly elevated the importance of the foreign office bureaucratically
                    and their own role. Certainly there were some who in private conversations would
                    express reservations about Genscher's policies and adopt what one might call a
                    more pro-American stance, and who felt that Germany should not have this sort of
                    in-between position between West and East and should be more firmly anchored in
                    the Western camp. There were certainly people who would express those
                    sentiments. I don't recall hearing of any open dissent within the foreign
                    office. From time to time some of the diplomats who went over on temporary
                    assignment to the Chancellery would articulate views somewhat different from
                    Genscher's, but the Chancellery was not a powerful force in foreign policy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chancellery being where Kohl was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But anyway, I just want to say the chancellery was where
                        the chancellor was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kohl.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The foreign policy shop in the Chancellery was small but attracted some
                    of the best people from the foreign service ranks. Among the senior people in
                    the foreign office there was a powerful group of out-and-out Genscherites who
                    had been his prot�g�s going back to the mid-70'smany years and whom he had
                    promoted quickly through the ranks.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: These senior officers owed their rapid rise almost entirely to Genscher
                    and they were intensely loyal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, we'll put at the end here you left in the

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I went into the European Bureau, specifically into the Office of
                    Regional Political Military Affairs, where I was involved directly in the
                    negotiations on CFE (Conventional Forces in Europe).</p>

                <p>CHAPMAN: And left in the summer of '91.</p>

                        conventional arms. What was the issue that you were mainly dealing

                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: EUR's role was essentially to backstop the U.S. delegation in Vienna and
                    our people in NATO. This was a complicated process. CFE was a multilateral arms
                    control forum in which all the NATO and then Warsaw Pact countries were engaged,
                    and in theory at least Western policy in the negotiations was coordinated
                    amongst the NATO allies in Brussels so that we would all sing off the same sheet
                    of music while doing the actual negotiating in Vienna. The particular job that
                    my office had was to write and coordinate interagency the instructions that went
                    into our mission in NATO for intra-Alliance coordination, but in effect we were
                    writing instructions for the delegation in Vienna as well. I remember this as an
                    exceedingly busy time, and I often remained in the office until past midnight to
                    finish interagency clearance of instructions for the following day. CForiginally
                    entitled CAF�, but that prompted too many jokes for a Vienna-based forupicked up
                    where the old MBFR (Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction) negotiations had left
                    off, and there was a hope, at the beginning little more than that, that the
                    simple change in forum coupled with Soviet readiness to discuss equipment
                    reductions would produce results where MBFR had yielded precious little over the
                    years. Clearly it was the break-up of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe, as
                    well as ongoing change within the Soviet Union and in Soviet policy, that made
                    it possible to conclude an agreement in little more than a year. What started
                    out as a bloc-to-bloc negotiation ended up as more of a more free-for-all on the
                    Eastern side, with group discipline eroding day by day. Still the treaty's
                    provisions were cast in terms of a Western group of nations and an Eastern group
                    of nations, representing NATO and the former Warsaw Pact. Each group of nations
                    then determined how to divide its allotted equipment totals among its members.
                    This was in itself a protracted and complicated process that then had to be
                    repeated, at least in part, when the Soviet Union broke up and the old Soviet
                    holdings had to be parceled out amongst the new republics.</p>
                <p>Policy-making on CFE in Washington was often a real tussle. I participated in an
                    interagency working group chaired by the NSC that took the first cut at crafting
                    policy and developing instructions. The group was chaired, incidentally, by
                    Heather Wilson, who is now a Republican congresswoman from New Mexico but then
                    had just resigned from the Air Force. In classical interagency fashion, issues
                    that we could not resolve in the working group were referred to an assistant
                    secretaries group and higher as necessary. The dynamics were unusual, in that
                    often the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were arrayed against
                    the Office of the Secretary of Defense and ACDA, not the line-up one would most
                    expect. On the face of it, ACDA should have been the most desirous of achieving
                    an agreement and the most pro-arms control, but it often turned out that they
                    were very difficult to deal with. I don't know whether this had to do with the
                    particular ACDA officials engaged on CFE, or whether the agency leadership had
                    decided to take a tougher line. But my recollection is that we in the State
                    Department cooperated most easily with Joint Chiefs of Staff, which obviously
                    put us in a better position than if JCS and OSD were lined up against us. OSD
                    representatives had to acknowledge that it was difficult to challenge the Joint
                    Chiefs on purely military issues, which of course were the essence of the
                    negotiation.</p>

                        you are and by the time you were doing this, the situation was
                        disintegrating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Oh yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so you have battalions of tanks or whatever you want
                        to call them, sitting under the control of East Germany, which is rapidly
                        sort of joining up with West Germany. You've got Czech tanks, which had been
                        part of the Warsaw Pact, which is now obviously removing itself. I mean, how
                        do you, I mean, it's like shooting at a target that's wiggling all over, you
                        don't know who, in a way you didn't know whose side, a lot of this equipment
                        would be on or whether it would be on any side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: That was true in a sense although for many of the countries of the
                    Eastern Bloc, the Warsaw Pact countries, the predominant holdings of equipment
                    were still Soviet-held rather than the East German or Czech. Despite all the
                    changes going on, or perhaps in part because of the state of flux in Eastern
                    Europe, the Soviets wanted to keep as much as they could in Eastern Europe or at
                    least to have substantial holdings of treaty limited equipment in areas of the
                    Soviet Union adjacent to Eastern Europe. This became a key issue because we
                    wanted to encourage them to move their equipment as far into the Soviet Union as
                    possible and preferably beyond the Urals, both to constrain their ability to
                    intervene military in Eastern Europe and to limit the threat to NATO's flanks,
                    those areas (Turkey and Norway) where NATO territory directly abutted the Soviet
                    Union. Of course, encouraging the Soviets to move equipment beyond the Urals
                    aroused concerns among the Chinese and the Japanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned about the southern flank, particularly
                        Turkey and, you know, the Soviets had and still have problems down with the
                        Caucasian countries, and parts of its own country Chechyen and that. Was
                        that an issue while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes. Turkey was concerned that a lot of Soviet equipment pulled out of
                    Eastern Europe might end up adjacent to Turkey on the southern flank, and that's
                    why we insisted on writing special flank provisions that would prohibit the
                    Soviets from stationing more than a certain amount of equipment on the flank
                    area facing Turkey. And the same applied to the northern flank as well, so that
                    the Soviets could not station disproportionate forces opposite Norway or Sweden
                    or Finland. In the north these special restrictions applied generally to the
                    Leningrad military area, and in the south to Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and
                    the northern Caucasus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what were you getting from your sources about how
                        the Soviets were- were the Soviets and the negotiators having- in disarray
                        or, what was their outlook as we saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: It was clear that the Soviets were having a hard time keeping control
                    over their Warsaw Pact colleagues, at least compared to previous multilateral
                    arms control negotiations. Eastern positions would emerge that were plainly not
                    exactly what the Soviets would have wanted. A lot of these countries quite
                    rightly wanted to get Soviet forces off their own territory, or at least to see
                    them substantially reduced, which went against the grain of the Soviet desire to
                    have at least a modicum of strength in Eastern Europe to sort of protect their
                    own interests in view of all the uncertainty that existed at that time. I don't
                    recall enough of the actual negotiations in Vienna to be able to give a complete
                    answer to that question as to how much the Soviets were in disarray. It was
                    certainly a very different picture from what it had once been. There was strong
                    evidence that Soviet imposed cohesion within the Warsaw Pact was breaking down
                    and that had an effect on their negotiating position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we, I mean were you, U.S. seen a problem in NATO with
                        our NATO allies of saying oh, we don't any war, let's get rid of all this
                        military equipment, almost unilateral disarmament?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: There were differing views, obviously, within the NATO alliance, and
                    quite often a lot of frustration among certain European allies that we were
                    holding things up and moving much too slowly. They took the position that, in
                    the new circumstances in Europe, we could certainly afford to make more
                    concessions. The British were probably the closest to us in their way of
                    thinking. The Germans tended to be more eager to reach agreement as it was in
                    their obvious interest to push Soviet forces out of East Germany, while an
                    agreement would also help alleviate domestic pressures to reduce the size of
                    American forces stationed in the Federal Republic as a way of lessening the
                    disruption that those forces caused in the way of training damage and noise from
                    low level flying. And it was generally in keeping with the more forward-leaning
                    German approach towards dealing with the East that they would push for a faster
                    pace in the negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, what particular, did you have any particular
                        area that you were particularly working on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Not really. I functioned as a section head within RPM and there people
                    in the section who worked on specific areas; my job was to oversee the process
                    and ensure that instructions to the field got out on time. We were actually
                    writing instructions for our representatives on a number of coordinating groups
                    at NATO, working on verification issues and data as well as the overall
                    negotiating strategy. The group that dealt with verification matters was labeled
                    the green team, and was not surprisingly dominated by intelligence people from
                    the various allies. My section did not have any verification experts, but it was
                    still our job to write and clear the instructions for green team meetings and
                    get feedback from our NATO mission and the delegation in Vienna. We had only a
                    handful of people — myself, two other officers and a couple of presidential
                    management internand the pace of work was intense. More times than I would care
                    to remember one agency would hold up the transmittal of instructions until late
                    in the evening before a key NATO session, and typically the issue in contention
                    had been taken to the agency leadership so there was no room for flexibility at
                    the working level. We would end up trying to resolve this issue at 10:30 at
                    night, and not finding too many people around to deal with. So many times I
                    would send the draft instructions over to Heather Wilson at the NSC with a
                    number of bracketed sections, leaving it up to her to resolve the dispute. She
                    was a decisive person, and would usually rule against the lone hold-out and then
                    take the flak the following day. I might add, since the agency doesn't exist
                    anymore, that most often it was the ACDA people who caused these last-minute
                    problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would think ACDA would be for, you know, things going
                        in the right direction and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I can't explain it. It was a mystery to all of us why ACDA proved so
                    difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, let's make a posit. What about ACDA could see the
                        handwriting on the wall that essentially there's going to be a lot of
                        disarmament and why do you need to have a disarmament agency if the major
                        cause of arms control is being the confrontation between the two blocs it
                        was going out of business? I don't know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I don't think that was the case, at least not that early on. In the
                    succeeding years we essentially went beyond arms control as it had been known
                    for many decades. We then no longer had a bloc-to-bloc situation, not only in
                    the conventional arena but in other arms control negotiations conducted, say,
                    through the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Once the Soviets were out of
                    Europe and the superpower relationship lost some of its focus, we moved away
                    from classical arms control to concentrate more on non-proliferation, not only
                    nuclear but chemical and biological as well. We strengthened the biological
                    weapons convention of 1972 and negotiated a chemical weapons convention.</p>

                    <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that would be a case for the Soviets and the
                        Americans to be on the same side, wouldn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes. In the field of chemical weapons the United States and the Soviet
                    Union or Russia had by far the greatest holdings of any countries, and both of
                    us, I believe, wanted to get rid of these weapons because we simply couldn't
                    envision their use. The main concern on our part was whether the Russians were
                    being totally honest, whether they had in fact declared all the weapons they had
                    and would destroy everything as they promised. But beyond the U.S.-Russian
                    equation was the general concern about chemical weapons or the chemicals or
                    their precursors getting into hands of others who might be willing to actually
                    use them in warfare or in a terrorist incident.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well by the time you left in '91, how stood things in your
                        perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: The CFE treaty was signed in 1990, and there were some surprises when it
                    came to exchanging data with the Soviets that had to do with the issue of naval
                    forces. Naval forces per se were not covered in the treaty, and we had taken a
                    very firm position from the very start that they should not be included. In the
                    initial data exchange the Soviets cited the exclusion of naval forces as
                    justification for their not reporting large numbers of tanks and armored combat
                    vehicles which were allocated to naval infantry forces rather than land forces
                    per se. We had thought there was a clear understanding that equipment belonging
                    to naval infantry would be counted. This turned into a major problem, and we
                    envisaged all sorts of difficulties when it came to ratification of the treaty.
                    Opponents were bound to emphasize that here the Soviets were violating the
                    agreement before the ink was dry. So we embarked on a further negotiation
                    designed to effectively impose limits on treaty-limited equipment allocated to
                    naval forces, and this obviously delayed for some time the process of finally
                    wrapping up the treaty. Then later the dissolution of the Soviet Union brought
                    with it further problems in terms of allocating Soviet treaty holdings among the
                    successor republics.</p>
                <p>For the second year of this assignment my section also took on responsibility for
                    backstopping a separate set of negotiations in Vienna aimed at concluding
                    further confidence-building measures between East and West, going beyond those
                    already agreed in the CSCE context. This embraced what we used to call soft arms
                    control — notifications of troop movements, reciprocal visits and inspections,
                    and other such measures designed to engender openness and trust and bring about
                    military stability in Central Europe. These were much less prominent
                    negotiations, and they were concluded satisfactorily in the spring of 1991.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then in '91 when you finished where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I was then assigned as deputy director of the office of Central European
                    affairs, which covered Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Much of my two years in
                    this assignment was devoted to following up on German unification in October
                    1990, tying up loose ends and that sort of thing. We carried out a fairly
                    substantial renegotiation of the German supplementary agreement to the NATO
                    status of forces agreement that pared back on some of the particular rights and
                    privileges that U.S. forces had in Germany under the old agreement. This was
                    done largely at German behest, so as to bring the agreement more into accord
                    with full German sovereignty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this include getting out of Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Not as part of this agreement. We had removed our forces from Berlin as
                    part of the unification process when the four power status of Berlin legally
                    ceased to exist. That was all agreed up as part of the pre-unification package.
                    The supplementary agreement had never actually applied to the forces we had in
                    Berlin which were there in their own right as, legally speaking, an occupation
                    force. It applied only to forces in the Federal Republic proper. As a matter of
                    practice, however, a lot of the procedures that were employed with our forces in
                    the Federal Republic were carried over to the forces in Berlin because both were
                    under the same U.S. Army command, and the military generally like to follow
                    uniform practices and procedures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had Austria and Switzerland too? You know, they both
                        were neutral countries but all of a sudden neutrality was no longer, meant
                        anything almost, you know, I mean, in this situation, you had all sorts of
                        other countries. Did you see, were they trying to readjust, or adjust their
                        status regarding the alliance or was it business as usual?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: In the case of Switzerland neutrality was a somewhat different concept
                    than in the case of Austria. Swiss neutrality had been gone back for centuries;
                    in Austria it was of more recent vintage, a factor of the Cold War. The Swiss
                    showed little or no inclination to change things in the early nineties; my
                    recollection is that an association agreement with the EU that would have
                    brought Switzerland some tariff benefits was rejected by popular referendum. But
                    Austria certainly wanted to end its formal neutrality status and join the EU and
                    more generally to be included in Western councils.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you by what, '93 you had moved on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I went to London in the summer of '93.</p>

                <p>CHAPMAN: I was deputy political counselor at the London embassy for three years.
                    The job came open unexpectedly, and I of took it as much for personal as
                    professional reasons. My mother, who was English born, had gone back to live in
                    England after my father died and was only an hour's drive or so from London. So
                    obviously the idea of being able to see her quite frequently was obviously
                    attractive to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, what were you doing from '93 to '96 in London?
                        I mean, what were you mainly?</hi>

                <p>CHAPMAN: I had sort of a mixed portfolio, with certain substantive

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Mike Habib.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you spell that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: H-A-B-I-B. I did a fair amount of contact work with the British
                    political parties. At that time the Conservatives were still in power, but it
                    became increasingly clear by 1995 or so that Labour was going to win the next
                    election. So a lot of our efforts were directed at getting to know senior Labour
                    politicians better, to build relationships with them, and to brief them on U.S.
                    thinking on key foreign policy issues. I found this fascinating. The
                    Conservatives had of course been in power since 1979, and they were very few
                    Labour politicians still active in 1995 who had served in the Callaghan
                    governmenmaybe a few who had been very junior ministers at that time. By and
                    large the Labour leadership had been in opposition for their entire political
                    careers. We set out to establish working ties with all the shadow ministers with
                    portfolios related to foreign and defense policy, in the hope of being able to
                    convince them of the rightness of U.S. views on the major issues in these
                    fields. Mike Habib and I had several sessions with Robin Cook, the shadow
                    foreign secretary, who had started out on the left wing of the party and had
                    been affiliated with the unilateral disarmament movement in the 1970's, and who
                    in 1995 still entertained serious doubts about NATO. Cook was very personable,
                    charming, with a brilliant mind, and one of the best public speakers in the
                    Labour ranks. He listened to us carefully and in the end I think we managed to
                    convince him of the continuing importance of NATO and to get across to him U.S.
                    viewpoints on the major issues of the day. We sought to cultivate many other
                    prominent Labour parliamentarians, with the goal of learning what they thought
                    on issues of importance to us and making a bit of a head start in trying to
                    encourage them to see our points of view.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>In the foreign policy area, I focused on the former Yugoslavia and the former
                    Soviet Union. Bosnia took up a lot of my time, with the conflict then in full
                    flight. For at least a year or so the U.S. tried to keep out of it, the Clinton
                    administration taking the position that this was something for the Europeans to
                    handle. But the Europeans after a while openly admitted that they could not
                    resolve the issue without American help and intervention. The British pushed
                    very strongly for us to get more deeply involved, and eventually that led to the
                    formation of the so-called contact group of ourselves and the British and the
                    French and the Germans to coordinate efforts to bring the conflict to an end.
                    There were some major disagreements in the contact group, and we certainly had
                    our differences with the British. Ironically, after pressing us to get involved
                    the Europeans then complained loudly during the Dayton negotiations and
                    afterwards that we were taking too active a role and were excluding them from
                    the process. There was a lot of unhappiness in London as in Bonn and Paris over
                    the way Holbrooke ran the show at Dayton.</p>
                <p>I remember that during a diplomatic reception at Buckingham Palace shortly after
                    Dayton, Pauline Neville-Jones, who was political director at the Foreign Office
                    and had headed the British delegation at Dayton, came up to me and gave me an
                    earful for 20 minutes on how impossible it was to work with Dick Holbrooke and
                    how he had eviscerated the U.S.-UK relationship. Holbrooke got what he wanted
                    but certainly ruffled a lot of feathers in the process.</p>

                <p>CHAPMAN: By the mid-nineties there were new people in charge, both in the
                    leadership ranks and in the level immediately below. Certain of them had
                    migrated from the far left to the center. Robin Cook had been a left-winger, a
                    prominent member of the unilateral disarmament faction in the eighties, but had
                    swung far enough to the center so as to be able to join Tony Blair's shadow
                    cabinet in 1994. The party generally had been moving towards the center ever
                    since Michael Foote had been eased out in the mid-eighties. Kinnock, Foote's
                    successor as party leader, was a leftist and a Welshman to boot, but over his
                    long period in office he moved the party away from extreme positions,
                    recognizing that it stood no prospect of regaining power the way it was. Kinnock
                    came very close to defeating John Major in the 1992 election. It was not an easy
                    thing to do to move the party towards the center given the strength of the trade
                    union movement within the party at that time and the radical views of the trade
                    union leadership. So as Kinnock, John Smith and Blair sought to make Labour
                    electable one of their main objectives was to limit the strength and authority
                    of the trade union movement within the party by changing the rules on
                    nominations and on voting at the annual conferencesteps like this designed to
                    lessen the trade union role while not causing the unions to bolt from the party
                    for fear they might form their own more left wing party which would then
                    hopelessly bifurcate Labour and leave the Conservatives in power for generations
                    to come. Many of the new people coming to the fore had made their way up through
                    the party rather than the trade unions, and they were practical politicians
                    rather than ideologuemen and women who wanted to be in power and to be able set
                    national policy. There was an entirely new mindset in the Labour party, strongly
                    influenced by the example of Bill Clinton moving the Democratic party towards
                    the center and his articulating a Third Way.</p>

                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes, I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that, I mean, okay, the negotiations, everybody

                        that, I mean, it's hard for allies to negotiate I think, but anyway, how did
                        things, did things come back together again or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: They did to a considerable extent. Obviously we had to cooperate on
                    implementation of the agreement. The British hosted a Bosnia implementation
                    conference in London in December of '95. Our approach post-Dayton was to give
                    the Europeans as great a role as we possibly could in implementing this
                    agreement. Christopher was not present at the London Conference, which was at
                    the foreign minister level and well-attended by foreign ministers. Deputy
                    Secretary Talbott, who chaired the U.S. side, left halfway through the
                    conference.</p>

                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes, we were bringing the OSCE into the picture at that time. My
                    recollection is that we wanted to give the OSCE, rather than the UN or NATO, the
                    principal role in monitoring the agreement, and to put a senior European figure
                    in charge of Bosnian reconstruction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the British public was viewing the United
                        States at this time? I mean, you know, right now you have a rather
                        anti-American strain. Was there a residue of anti-Americanism did you find
                        among, say, the chattering class or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: It's always out there to a certain degree, in Britain as in most other
                    European countries. But by the same token it has been my experience that when
                    you get out of the capital and talk to people in the small towns and villageand
                    this is true, I think, in France as well as in Britaiyou find that people are
                    very friendly towards the United States. They remember the good things that we
                    have done for them. They admire the United States for what we've achieved
                    economically, technologically and culturally in a very broad sense, and tend to
                    ignore the twists and turns of politics. Even amongst the chattering classes at
                    that time there was not that much anti-Americanism or disagreement with U.S.
                    goals and policies. It was still relatively early after the end of the Cold War.
                    We were jointly resolving the issues that had arisen out of the end of the Cold
                    War and the breakup of the Soviet bloc, Yugoslavia being the main one. So I
                    think it was an era of essentially good feelings. I think the British people
                    felt very good towards the United States at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Being in London, did you ever get the feeling that it was
                        the Americans and the Brits against the French over various issues or not?
                        Was there a French factor in there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I don't recall much of this in connection with Bosnia. The policy
                    disputes generally ranged us against the Europeans as a whole.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, who was the ambassador while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Ray Seitz was the ambassador when I arrived, and he was succeeded by
                    Admiral Crowe in the spring of 1994. These were two very different ambassadors.
                    Seitz of course was a career officer who was on his third tour in London and had
                    in fact served as DCM only a few years before being named ambassador. He knew
                    everyone worth knowing in the capital and outside, was on top of a broad range
                    of issues, and in effect was his own political section. Crowe was no stranger to
                    Britain and had been close to the British military leadership. But this was his
                    first diplomatic assignment, and he did not have same energy level or the same
                    hands-on approach that Seitz had. He tended to focus on two or three issues,
                    Bosnia and Northern Ireland chief among them. One obvious difference between the
                    two was that Crowe could pick up the telephone and call the president or the
                    vice president and get through directly; which Ray Seitz as a career man
                    couldn't do. My impression was that Crowe was an effective ambassador. I got
                    along very well with him personally. He was a charming, easy-going, likeable
                    individual, not a military man in the accustomed mold.</p>

                <p>CHAPMAN: No, I left in the summer of '96. Labour took over in May of '97.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Conservative party? I mean, were

                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Oh yes. We had been working with them for many, many years. Since they
                    were the party in power, only the ambassador had access to ministers; the rest
                    of us had to be content with talking to Members of Parliament and officials at
                    party headquarters. But they were ready interlocutors, particularly so on the
                    margins of the annual party conferences, where things were more informal and the
                    bar was the usual venue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you left there in '96?</hi>

                <p>CHAPMAN: I came back to Washington and took an assignment as an office director
                    in the Bureau of International Organizations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: From '96 to '98. The key issue that the bureau faced at that time was
                    finding some way to repay our debts to the United Nations, which had grown to
                    almost unmanageable proportions. The Republicans, who controlled Congress, were
                    very reluctant to shell out money to an organization that a lot of them didn't
                    like and that they believed was ineffectual and in fact acting counter to U.S.
                    interests. They were ready to appropriate funds to pay off some of our debts,
                    but only in return for far-reaching reforms at the UN. The Administration was
                    given the task of persuading the other members of the UN to accept these
                    changes, which was a real uphill battle. Every time we met with representatives
                    of country X to argue for reform, we were met with the refrain that the U.S.
                    should first pay off its debts in full, on time and without conditions. This
                    came to be known colloquially as the IFOTWOC line. Basically the issue did not
                    get resolved until Holbrook became our ambassador to the UN and was able to
                    convince the Congress to appropriate enough money to pay off most of our
                    debts.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What part of the pie did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I headed the Office of Policy, Public and Congressional Affairs, so the
                    assistant secretary was looking to me to rebuild IO bureau contacts on the Hill
                    and do a lot of the basic spadework on the arrears issue. I found that
                    Congressional staffers were willing to meet and talk, chiefly the Democrats who
                    were seeking to whittle down some of the Republicans' extravagant demands. But
                    unfortunately our Bureau of Congressional Affairs claimed they had a monopoly on
                    contacts with the Hill and nixed all my efforts to meet staffers and press the
                    Administration's viewpoint. This was nonsensical given that paying off the
                    arrears was a major Administration goal and that the Congressional Affairs
                    Bureau simply didn't have the people to devote to this effort, whereas we in IO
                    did. This monopoly practice was later terminated by Secretary Powell, but
                    obviously not soon enough to help me out. We did have a few
                    carefully-orchestrated meetings with staffers on the Hill on the arrears issue,
                    under Congressional Affairs supervision, but not nearly enough to be able to
                    make any headway on the problem.</p>

                        Hill now, the military's had an office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Yes. I'm not sure exactly what that does. I think a lot of it initially
                    had to do with the practical business of coordinating congressional travel
                    overseas. And there is a consular component to it as well, I think.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you sort of feel that the brunt of, it seemed
                        that Congress turned almost rabid against Clinton. I mean, you know, the
                        Republicans, I'd never seen it so bad. Well, they tried to impeach him over
                        what amounted to a very minor matter, I mean, this was an excuse to get rid
                        of a president. Did you find it difficult to talk to people, you know, kind
                        of the movers and shakers within the Republican party?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: There were not too many Republicans whom, at least at the staff level, I
                    had access to or maintained contacts with. I can think of a few individuals on
                    the staffs of moderate Republican senators and congressmen. The Democrats were
                    largely receptive to our pitch. A lot of them supported substantial reform of
                    the UN organization but were nonetheless cognizant of our obligation to pay our
                    dues. The Democrats accepted the notion that the UN was a useful institution,
                    without making it out to be more than it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape four, side one with Geoff Chapman. Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: So to the extent that we in the IO bureau were able to have direct
                    contacts with the Hill on the arrears issue we were dealing mostly with
                    Democrats. The assistant secretary, Princeton Lyman, was able to meet with some
                    of the moderates on the Republican side, such as Jim Leach in the House and
                    Gordon Smith in the Senate. But I don't recall any sessions with major
                    leadership figures on the Republican side, either in the House or the Senate.
                    Jesse Helms was, to say the least, a strong critic of the UN and well set in his
                    views; there probably wasn't much we could have done to convince him to change
                    course. I don't see the Republican stance on this issue as particularly directed
                    against the Clinton presidency. It stemmed from their jaundiced view of the
                    United Nations, that it didn't really serve American purposes and wasn't worth
                    our pouring money into.</p>
                <p>During this time that I was in IO Bolton was-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Bolton.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>CHAPMAN: John Bolton, right. He had been IO assistant secretary in the George
                    H.W. Bush administration, so he was out of government at this time. The views
                    that he was articulating on the UN were basically consonant with those of many
                    Republicans in Congress, namely that it was a do-nothing institution that we
                    could just as easily do without. But what's interesting about this conservative
                    critique is that, while maintaining that the UN was a powerless institution, it
                    let stand accusations on the right-wing fringe that the UN was plotting to take
                    over the United States and eradicate our sovereignty, and that the Democrats
                    were prepared to abdicate our sovereignty. Plenty of conservative congressmen
                    accepted the notion that placing sites in the U.S. on the World Heritage site
                    register amounted to recognizing UN sovereignty over that site, and they did
                    little to counter fanciful tales of black helicopters filled with UN shock
                    troops threatening American communities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Black helicopters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Black helicopters, supposedly UN helicopters spying on and threatening
                    people in the U.S. We'd get constituent letters making such claims forwarded to
                    us from the Congress, and we'd have to respond with a straight face.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you did that until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Until '98.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: Then I spent three years in the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs,
                    quite a departure for me. I realized at this point that for a variety of reasons
                    I wasn't going to stay around much longer in the Foreign Service, and was
                    looking for something in the way of a new and different experience. So I went
                    into the EB Bureau and worked in telecommunications policy for three years. I
                    was dealing with counterparts in what was for me an entirely new set of
                    agencies, principally the Department of Commerce and the FCC (Federal
                    Communications Commission), plus the economic policy side of the NSC. I honestly
                    don't think I achieved anything of great significance in those three years, but
                    it was a fascinating intellectual challenge in many ways. One had to absorb a
                    certain amount of the technology to be a player in the policy arena. I certainly
                    learned more than I ever thought I would about wireless technologies.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>One the initiatives I was involved with was an effort to expand use of the
                    Internet in the developing world. This was spearheaded largely by Ira Magaziner,
                    who was the health guru at the beginning of the first Clinton term and then
                    turned to Internet policy issues in the second term. The Administration made a
                    determined push to expand Internet use in the U.S., but allied with this was a
                    campaign to promote its use in the poorer countries of the world essentially as
                    a development tool. The focus here was largely on Africa, but also to some
                    extent Asia and Latin America, with projects to get people hooked up to the
                    Internet, to make them Internet literate, and to involve them in a rudimentary
                    e-commerce as a way of pulling themselves out of poverty. We were never able to
                    secure any additional money for the program; it was a matter of pulling money
                    out of existing pots and trying to direct it more at endeavors of this kind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well was there suspicion on the part of many countries
                        that didn't have it that the Internet was a vast American conspiracy or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I don't recall any such attitudes among the developing countries.
                    African governments and peoples were only too happy to receive assistance in
                    building out their domestic telecommunications networks and to get exposure to
                    the technological know-how. It may sound a little farfetched to connect isolated
                    African villages up to the Internet, to make the villagers computer literate,
                    and to introduce them to the wonders of e-commerce; but this did work, at least
                    on a small scale. There was certainly a lot of resentment in the developed world
                    over U.S. control of the Internethe feeling being that this should be subject to
                    international controbut I did not have any sense that people in the developing
                    world saw the Internet as a big American conspiracy out to run their lives for
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling while you were working,
                        particularly on something like the Internet, that you were, the point of the
                        spear of a new revolution that was coming around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: I think we felt we were on the cutting edge, in terms of trying to
                    expand Internet use globally and make it a tool for development. We were also
                    peripherally involved in the effort to set up a new structure for managing the
                    Internet, shifting this task from a wholly American company under license from
                    the Department of Commerce to a new private international entity for which there
                    was effectively no precedent. The Europeans and others wanted some international
                    governmental oversight of this new entity, but the Clinton administration
                    pressed to have it completely in private hands. There was a certain amount of
                    opposition in U.S. business circles to handing over control of the Internet to
                    an international entity, on the grounds that we had built it and it was working
                    fine as it was. But certainly people in the Clinton administration recognized
                    that ultimately some form of internationalization was inevitable, and that both
                    the U.S. Government and the U.S generally would have to cede unilateral policy
                    control.</p>

                        these issues very much? Who's running it and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAPMAN: That was the key issue for the Europeans and the Asians, to try to end
                    the American monopoly on running the Internet, on setting what the policy would
                    be and how it would develop in future years.</p>

                <p>CHAPMAN: Reminiscent of King Canute ordering the tide not to come in any further.
                    I don't see how anyone could hope to prevent the spread of the English language
                    as the lingua franca of the Internet.</p>
