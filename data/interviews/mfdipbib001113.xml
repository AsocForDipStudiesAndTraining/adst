<p>The Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training Foreign Affairs Oral History Project Foreign Service Spouse Series</p>
<p>PATRICIA CODY SQUIRE</p>
<p>Interviewed by: Jewell Fenzi</p>
<p>Initial interview date: April 30, 1990</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This is Jewell Fenzi on Monday, April 30, 1990.  I'm interviewing Patricia Squire, Mrs. Christopher Squire, at my home.  Pat is a member of the Oral History Project and she also has spent a great deal of time in Eastern Europe and I think our conversation this morning will deal principally with that.  (Pause). . . and with her mother-in-law who was also a Foreign Service spouse.  And one of Pat's daughters, Margo, is third generation Foreign Service, and we'll discuss that, too.</hi>
</p>
<p>Maybe you'd like to start somewhere else, but I like the idea of the introduction of the three generations and the influence of your mother-in-law on you when you were a junior wife.</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Well, going to the coffees before the Association was such, you'd go with your hat and your gloves and people knew my mother-in-law.  The Service was small.  My father-in-law was originally with the Department of Commerce, worked with Hoover in Belgium, and then was Department of Commerce and was in London and met her.  They went off to Germany, both Berlin and then Hamburg where Chris and his sister were born.  And then he was our Trade Commissioner in Australia for twelve years which is how Chris grew up there.  And then went to Poland and was in Poland in 1939.</p>
<p>His name was Earl Carleton Squire but she called him “Chris” because she thought as an Englishwoman, how terrible to be “Earl Carleton Squire.”  So he became Chris Squire really.  And her name was Betty Squire and then she married a man named John Massie, so she was Betty Massie.  She married an Australian and went back to Australia.  But she was a very strong, very attractive lady.</p>
<p>In 1940, Chris's father died in London, and she came back to the United States with no money and two young children.  He was in boarding school and she went to Madeira on full scholarships and she went to work, took a secretarial course, and first went to work for the British Embassy and then Dick Casey who became Governor General of Australia.  He was a great personal friend from all their years in Australia.  He said, “You have to come and work for us.”  And then the next man had a sick wife and then there was a widower, so she was the social secretary for the Australian Embassy for numbers of years.  And she knew everybody here in Washington.  It was a fascinating, fascinating time.</p>
<pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
<p>Years later her second husband said, “Well typical of your mother-in-law.  She's gone up to London to have lunch with the Queen and tea with her old char, and she's probably more excited about the old char.”  But the Canadian High Commissioner at that time had been a friend here in Washington.  Lester Pearson was a great friend.  She lived in a little house on “R” Street that overlooked Connecticut Avenue and the whole back of the second floor was a building that had burned down and this was a terrace.  And she had wonderful parties and was just charming.  And then in 1947, she went back to London, and this Australian brought his daughter down to see my sister-in-law and this wonderful romance started.  So she married him and went to London.  So everybody whom she hadn't met in Washington, she subsequently met in London.  It was mind-boggling, the people whom she knew.</p>
<p>So she did, she taught me a lot.  She knew all kinds of people and all kinds of people knew her in the old days.  I guess I'm talking as much about this because I want Margo to be interviewed, and she is the third generation officer so it's important that a little bit is heard about my mother-in-law and the times that they had.  You know they came home every four years, paying their own way in the beginning.  They were loaned trunks.  They had these great trunks that they were loaned by the Department.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Steamer trunks.  Oh really!  I went away to college with one.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  They were given them and then they gave them back at a certain point.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  When did Chris's father enter the Service?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Oh now let's see.  Chris was born in 1923, they were married in 1922.  He certainly was in the Service in 1921.  Not too long after . . .  And then he was Department of Commerce until it amalgamated into the State Department and then he became the Economic Counselor, I guess, or the equivalent, in Warsaw.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  When the Foreign Commercial Service was amalgamated?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Yes, it was taken into the Service.  I'll probably think of other things.  And then went out and married and went and lived in Australia.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So she was in Australia when you were there?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  No, she died the year before we got there.</p>
<pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Oh what shame.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  It was very sad.  Chris wanted so badly to go as Consul General to Sydney and they said, “No, you've only been in your job for a year.”  And so he couldn't get the job and so went out as DCM the next year and she had just died.  So that was very sad.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What a shame.  But she must have opened all kinds of avenues for you here in Washington.  And in Australia, too.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Oh, yes.  I can remember sitting at the Australian Embassy having lunch with - I've gone blank on the name, but that's all right.  One of the former Ambassadors that she had worked for had come to receive honorary degrees at both Harvard and Yale.  An Australian.  And we went in to have lunch, just the two of us.  Somebody else was the Ambassador by that time.  And they talked and talked.  And he said, “You know, you really shouldn't say this.  Chris is an American Foreign Service officer!”  And she said, “Oh, I'll never think of him as anything but an Australian.”  And this was true.  So many of the people that she knew.</p>
<p>Oh, it made such a difference here.  In fact, in the beginning we couldn't even try to go out to Australia because his ties were so close with Australia.  Subsequently, they stopped it, just like with wives returning.  And it made such a difference, our time in Australia.  The day after Chris arrived, it was some big day, and Air Vice Marshall, who subsequently became Governor of New South Wales and entertained Di and Charles a couple of times, came up and bearhugged Chris and our very proper Defense Attach� said, “How do you know Sir James Roland so well?”  And Chris said, “I went to school with him for eleven years.”  (laughter)  And this was very true.  People had become all kinds of important people in high places whom he had known in Sydney as a boy.  So it was really just a second country for us, so it was wonderful going there.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Your mother sounds so contemporary in a way.  Was she into hats and gloves or did she wear them because that's what you did?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  I think she just wore them because that's what you did.  I think she was the kind of person who, if you asked her, she'd say, “Of course you have to wear them.”  Really, when you got down to it, she only wore them when she had to.  Very relaxed about things.  Went to Mary Elizabeth's Shop around the corner here.  Do you remember?  A lot of people were dressed by Mary Elizabeth Pennebaker who ran this shop here in Washington.  And she used to send her things all over the world.  She was a marvelous lady.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well after that, where do we go!  She really sounds like she was a very positive influence on your attitude toward the Foreign Service and everything.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Oh yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I'm looking at your topic sheet because you said middle of three generations in the Foreign Service.  Now where do we go from that?  Let's just start from the beginning.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Let's just start from the very beginning of my career because it was interesting.  We went to Prague.  And the last day in our Foreign Service class, they said where you could go.  And everybody was asking for Europe.  And the only people who got Europe were three people asking for Eastern Europe.  And sure enough, the next day, nobody was going to Europe but the three of us.  So Chris went off the next day, I think, to start learning some Czech.  He had Russian.  And three days later, they called up from the Turkish Desk to say, “Where is Squire?”  We were supposed to be going to - not Istanbul, the other.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Ankara?  Islamabad, no that's in Pakistan.  SQUIRE:  Well, it doesn't matter.</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I know what it is, Adana.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  And then he had a choice and wanted to go, but you often wonder - and I've talked to so many people - it's an awful thing being switched to post because you often wonder what would have happened had you gone there instead.  But we started off.  At that time, everybody was sent overseas.  So we just had a little bit of Czech because of his Russian, and we applied for our visas and it didn't come and it didn't come.  And this was the beginning of August and finally we packed up and I went up home.</p>
<p>And then they sent us to London very nicely because his family was leaving to go back to Australia.  And we went into Prague, finally, the very first part of November of 1951 with a 6-month old baby.  We were the first people to go into Czechoslovakia after they'd cut the staff.  It had been 160 and they cut it to 85 and then from 85 down to 13 and we were the first replacements.  And so no American had been in, no American came in for eighteen months after we got there.</p>
<pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
<p>And we set off, me with this little baby.  And I think when I crossed over the border.  We got to the airport and somebody leaned out - this was Ruth Thompson - somebody leaned out - there were a crowd of people, saying, “Give me the baby.”  The entire Embassy was out there.  The Briggses were in Germany because his secretary and our code man were getting married.  Everybody except for one man was out there to meet us.  And we went back to the Residence to stay with the Briggses.</p>
<p>You know, it's still the finest residence we have, this beautiful Petschek Palace.  And I wrote my mother that night.  “Here I was, scared about coming.  We have this gorgeous room.  I've never been in such a house in my life.”  And this was the beginning of our time in Czechoslovakia.  I've done Mrs. Briggs and a lot of people have talked about it, but it was a very exciting time.  A depressing time.  We had suitcases with medicines because they didn't know when we might be interned or kicked out.  We kept our cars ready to leave.  They just had no idea what might happen to us.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But isn't that extraordinary that they sent you under conditions like that with a new baby?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Well there were several others.  You just did it in those days.  And we literally did not have any. . . The three days after we arrived, we obviously knew all of our little Embassy, we were walking in what we thought were old clothes on Nokchekiny, one of the two big streets in Prague, and a Chevrolet came by and somebody leaned out and said, “Welcome to Prague, Squires,” and we were aghast.  And a couple of nights later we met this Canadian and said, “How did you know us?”  And he said, “Because we knew you were coming, and you were either the Squires, or you were illegally in the country.”  And literally, you knew everybody.  Nobody came into the country at that time.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  This was right after. . . SQUIRE:  Right after Bill Otis had been interned and we closed down our borders.  And we didn't send anybody from the State Department.  Nobody came.  Bill Otis was let out eighteen months later when Paul was three days old.  And then my mother, who had a chance to come in with me when I came back with the baby, and unfortunately she was the second person.  Some businessman was sitting when he heard Bill Otis was being released - sitting and waiting to be the first person who crossed into the country.  But it was an amazing time in those years.</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But you seemed to walk freely in the streets?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Oh we were followed.  Everywhere we were followed.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You were followed, but you weren't uneasy?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Well you got so used to being followed.  And not only the men but the women.  I remember meeting three other ladies at the dressmakers and looking out and we had four cars.  I mean why they were so concerned about us!</p>
<p>When Paul was about three months old we went to Slovakia with the Admin Officer and one of the secretaries, Chris and I.  We had two cars.  We'd go back every night at 5 to call.  And these two cars of people followed us.  We were the only cars driving through the countryside and they followed us everywhere we went.  At one point we stopped and did not hurry on after buying vegetables so that they could buy some vegetables.</p>
<p>And that day we sort of stopped at pub time and went to a little local bar and had good Czech beer.  And they sent some vodka over [to] the table - or slivovitz, I don't remember.  And we said, “We didn't order this.”  And they said, “No, but those gentlemen did”  (laughter)  And on our way back we stopped at a tiny little village and we went out and the other couple with us went to their car and we went to ours and then we lost them just going around the block.  And we didn't find them.  Both cars had gone off following them.</p>
<p>So we met roadblock after roadblock after roadblock until we arrived back in Prague.  And the other two cars were following him.  They just didn't know what we'd done.  They had lost us for about a half an hour.  And anything, anything could happen.</p>
<p>No, we were always followed.  And we could not leave the country.  We had to put in for twenty-four hours before we could go into Germany.  And that was always a little concern for medical reasons.  In fact I took Paul out when he was six weeks old for a check-up and drove back.  The truck went out every two months and filled up with food for our little commissary.  And I'd gone out with one of the wives who came back along with the truck food and we got to the border and I crossed over which was silly.  I suppose I should have waited for them.</p>
<p>And they didn't come and they didn't come and they didn't come and I was concerned about being there with the little baby.  So I started off by myself.  And I had a flat tire.  And a farmer came off the field and I thought, “You know, it's insulting to give him money.”  He was so excited about changing the tire and we could communicate in German.  So I gave him the bananas that I was taking back for my two-year old.  And he was so excited.  He said, “I'll have to tell them that they're a form of peach because my children have never seen bananas.”</p>
<pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
<p>And then I went into a gas station and I thought that they told me that my spare tire was low.  So I stopped in a little village and everybody was so excited - my car, a red convertible, the baby and me.  And I called and told Chris to come and get me.  I would wait along by the side of the road because my tire was flat.  Well it actually wasn't, but it was a wonderful opportunity for me to talk with these people and them to talk because we had no contact with the Czechs.  The few that we had met from people who had been there earlier, we literally got on buses and then walked and then got on another bus.  You were scared to death when you went in to see them for fear somebody would walk in and you would get them in trouble.  We weren't concerned.  And then the man eventually was sent off to prison and killed.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Were Czech and German close enough so that you could. . .</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  No, no.  I had an elderly maid and I had to learn one of the two languages and I'm not a linguist.  Everybody spoke German.  And once they established the fact that you were not a German, they would speak German with you.  It was a very useful language and I used it in Hungary, too.  So that's why I learned German.  Most of us did.  And we had so little contact with the people that you never felt the loss of it</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Just a little bit for the record on the tape, talk a little about the Otis situation that caused the borders to close.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Well this was after the Slanski trial and at that point we had correspondents in there.  (pause)  This was before we got there and Mary Kidd goes into that.  She was our ethnic speaker and she talks about that.  She was there at the trial everyday.  So I would only be saying what I heard.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  What we do in a case like this is say, “See Kidd, pages so and so.”</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  And Bill Otis was picked up and imprisoned and they thought they had, and I will fill this out. . . This great friend of ours, he was also in Budapest with us.  He and Chris shared a couch during the last days of the Revolution.  So we broke off all trade.  Nobody was allowed.  Nobody could get a passport to go into Czechoslovakia and we didn't do anything for two years, I believe it was that he was interned.</p>
<pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
<p>And we also had another man who had been a student in Bronislava at the time the Communists took over and he was second generation Czech and he was imprisoned because they thought he was a spy.  And then we heard nothing from him at all.  And one day the Consular people - Chris started off his Foreign Service career as the Consular Officer in the American Embassy in the morning, and as Allied High Commission Permit Officer in the afternoon with two jobs, two hats.  (laughter)</p>
<p>The Consular people came in and said that this man was waiting out there and he had literally escaped from prison and had been hiding in the woods for 18 months and had gotten himself to Prague and walked into the Embassy.  And he stayed until eventually one of these switches was made.  But this was all during this period that nobody went in and out of the country at all.  And then they cut us way down.  They gave them 24 hours to get out of the country.  And then Ellis Briggs always said that he got more out of his 13 people that was necessary than out of 86.  It was just a perfectly wonderful time.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was Bill Otis an American diplomat?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  No, he a correspondent, UP.  And after that we didn't have any correspondents at all.  I will add.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So that accounts for your close relationship with Mrs. Briggs and Ruth Thompson and Mary Kidd.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Oh yes.  Actually I met Mary Kidd after that.  Chris replaced her as a physical body - the thirteen.  He actually overlapped with the consular officer so it wasn't the job, but he replaced her and she then went to Vienna.  So we got to know her afterwards.  But through all of the people, we were a very close group of people from those days.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Was food a problem?  You didn't have to worry about education?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  There was an active black market.  We didn't have to worry about education, I didn't.  And we had a pretty good school.  The Anglo-American School was at our Embassy at that point and it was good.  Food was brought in.  People went out to Germany about every six weeks and we ordered from Vienna but it was easier to get to Germany.  And we brought food.  There was this little commissary and we brought in food.  We also had great shipments of food.  You were spending a lot of money bringing in the things that you needed.  Very little to buy in the country.</p>
<pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
<p>We were rationed for everything, potatoes, onions, just everything.  Chris, because he was the sixth diplomat and we were only allowed five, instead of being given diplomatic rations, he was given worker rations, so we had more meat than other people.  (laughter)  We did all right.  You'd go to a party and there would be salad and you'd sort of look at the number of people and count the pieces of lettuce and see whether you could take one or two.  And so we had very little in the way of fresh fruit, but we managed.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And you say you had no access to the Czechs at all. . .</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Very little</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So this was all inter-Embassy?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Inter-Embassy and the Diplomatic Community.  As I say, we did have two or three friends who had been passed on to us by people who were still there from '49.  But oh, so little.  It was by far the worse as far as that kind of association was concerned.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And you were there for about two years?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Two years, yes.  And then we came home.  I remember Chris was going to call up and say somebody was going somewhere.  And he called up and said that my college roommate was going to New York and came home.  And I said, “Why is Kiki going to New York?”  Her husband was a cattleman.  And I said, “Why are they going to New York?”  And he said, “No, we're going to New York.”</p>
<p>We were the only FSO6 in the country and there was nobody in Washington.  He went on the Board of the Foreign Service Association because he was such a junior officer.  And finally we were in New York and we lived outside and we couldn't afford to live!  So he came down here on business at some point and said, “I can't afford to live.  You've got to send me overseas.”  And they said, “No, we need you.”  He was head of the Czech Service of the Voice of America.  They wanted somebody who did not have family ties or political ties who had recently been there and replaced Jack Armitage who had done kind of the same thing, followed him a lot.</p>
<pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
<p>And anyway they said, “That's why we don't have people in Washington.”  And he said, “But you've got me in New York.”  We were then given an allowance, which was really something, to live in New York.  And then moved down here when the Voice moved.  And then he studied Hungarian and we started off for Hungary and we were aboard ship.  And the Hungarian Revolution started.  And we went into Budapest.  Also the Suez - we were in the middle of the Mediterranean when the Suez erupted.  And our ship was just a blaze of lights so they would know we weren't a British or a French warship coming in.</p>
<p>We went to Vienna and met up with the people who had come out of Budapest.  I want somebody to say this, somebody must be interviewed about this time.  Because they were all called into the Legation, they all went into the Legation, packed up immediately.  I mean they just left their houses, took what they thought was enough for overnight into the Legation and they never got back to their houses.  And they sent them.  And I'm a little foggy at how long they lived in the Legation, but for a fair bit of time they were all there.  They sent them out, non-language men sort of escorting the wives and children.  And they were sent back at the border.  And they went back and spent another night, and the next day they set out.  The fathers who included the Hungarian speakers and the military attach�s. . .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In other words, they initially sent the wife and children and then they sent the man.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Yes.  And this time they sent them out so they'd get their families.  And fortunately they did because they were interned for three days at the border with nothing.  I mean they had one change of clothing.  And finally, some child did have a bad cold and a doctor came in.  And he went in and told the authorities that the child had smallpox or diphtheria.  Anyway, something very contagious and terrible.  And he suspected that others did, too.  So they released them because of this.  And shipped them across the border.</p>
<p>And then they went into this pension where we came in and joined them the next day.  And these women had nothing.  The Embassy really did nothing for them.  Even two months later, nobody invited anybody for Thanksgiving dinner.  They didn't do any relief work.  The Embassy was just disgraceful.  All the relief work was done by we people connected with the Hungarian Legation.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So this was in Vienna?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  This was in Vienna.  Some of them started to go back.  I mean the wives went back who didn't have children and my husband went in during the five days before the Russians came back in, or right after that.  And we waited.  And then eventually we were sent up to Kiensay and went in just before Christmas.  Now that's an interesting story.</p>
<pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
<p>And at some point Cornelia Wailes - Tom Wailes was coming in as our new - wonderful people - coming in as our new minister.  And Mrs. Wailes was asked by the Thompsons who she'd like to see, what she'd like to do on her overnight in Vienna.  And she said, “I just want to meet with my girls.”  And she was asked by Mrs. Thompson, “Why in the world do you want to see them?”  Cornelia Wailes never got over that.  I'm saying something that maybe should be cut out, but it was an awfully bad time.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  No, I think it should be said.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Roberta Selby. . . .  We had traveled with the Selbys, another young family going into Budapest and we went to the Embassy and said, “Look, these kids are strapped on beds.  They don't have cribs.  We had two babies.  There's no high chairs.  There's just nothing.  They don't have any clothes.”  And we didn't any of us have any money.  And because we hadn't been there and were not sort of shocked by this experience that they'd been through, we demanded and we got these things.  But nothing was ever done for them.</p>
<p>Eventually there were just five of us left in this pension.  They came by and gave us all these dolls to re-dress for the children of American servicemen who'd left - the illegitimate children of American servicemen.  Nobody in the Embassy did.  We were given them because they didn't think we had anything to do.  Some of us went out everyday to the refugee camps and sorted clothing.  And this is where we've got to bring in Sarah Rogers.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Now which refugee camp?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  The Hungarian refugee camp and sorted clothes coming out.  The refugee work was done.  The prime moving behind what was done both in Budapest and in Vienna and back out here was done by Sarah and Tom Rogers.  They just organized everything.  They got all kinds of people to do. . .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Now what was Tom's position?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Tom was what would be the Economic Political Counselor.  And there was just one.  And just a marvelous guy who is now living in Pennsylvania.  His wife died of cancer and very few people - very few couples have not lost at least one by cancer who were there with us.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Now do you attribute that to something?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
<p>SQUIRE:  Both the British and the Americans, it's just unreal that at least three-quarters of the couples, one is gone, or in some cases, both.  I know of two couples who have married each other, they've both lost their spouses to cancer.  And then there are people like me.  I had a mild form which basically people don't know about.  I survived it and I'm fine.  But there have to be other people.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Has the State Department looked into this?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  No, I don't think so.  And they did as far as Moscow was concerned, but many, many more people were with us there at that time.  And all kinds of cancer - leukemia, spinal cancer - just a frightening amount of radiation, we decided.  And both couples - our second DCM and his wife have both died of cancer.  Just a whole lot of people.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And there's no study being done as to what the radiation might have been?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  No.  I felt too near it.  And I have this friend here who was with us there, the Agricultural Attach�'s wife who was there and she lost her husband a year and a half ago of cancer.  And we've talked about doing it, but she said, “Oh, we did all the business about Moscow and what happened?”  She was there in Moscow with us.  But I think it should be down.  I think the statistics - I don't know what good it's going to do.  But I think it shows how much we were affected by something at that time, both the men and the women.</p>
<p>Well, we had Cardinal Mindszenty.  All these things to talk about.  It was such an incredible time.  I read a re-print in the Foreign Service Journal of an article that was written in the '30s and somebody was talking about going to the Quiche Royale which was a wonderful restaurant in Budapest and said they were smitten with the Magyar spirit.  And we all were.  It was a wonderful place to be.  The people were so extraordinarily brave and forgiving.  They never criticized us personally for not coming to their help.  There was such pride in being an Hungarian.</p>
<p>I'll go back a little bit.  We went out to Kiensay and then two nights before Christmas - my daughter-in-law was talking about this because it was one of my son's first memories - we packed our children up - three of us who were left.  The three State Department wives and their families who were left in Kiensay.  We packed them up and put them bed and picked them up and took them down to the railroad station near Kiensay at 11 o'clock at night.  And they weren't even going to stop the train.  Finally they stopped it, but they would not open the sleeping cars.</p>
<pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
<p>I got on and it was the Saturday night before Christmas and the first time that a train like that had run since before the war, so it was jammed with people going to Vienna.  I sat with. . . One wife had a terribly high fever and we found her a seat with her baby.  The other one went off with our luggage.  And I had five little kids, two five-year olds, two four-year olds, and two three-year olds, one very crippled with polio.  And they were very good and they sat there until Salzburg when we all got off the train.  I put them all on the luggage rack and found her.  We got on the train.  (overlapping voices and noises)  We just sat.  They just sat on their suitcases the first hour.  We had four berths for nine people.  So I don't know.  Roberta Selby and I kind of switched back and forth.  And the next morning, we arrived back in Vienna and our three husbands were supposed to meet us.  And they'd been told that we were two hours late, so they'd gone down to have a cup of coffee.  And my husband, which was very typical of him, thought, “Well I'll just go see.”  So as we kind of fell off the train, just exhausted, Chris was the only one there to meet us.  ... and the children on one cart and the luggage on another.</p>
<p>And the Selbys and the Squires started forth in our two cars to go to Budapest.  And then it was late and it was snowing hard.  And the men were coming off the fields and you felt this tremendous pride in what they'd done.  And all of the sudden the Selby's car slid off the side of the road and down an embankment, and we were so upset at what had happened to them that we slid off the other side!  And this Russian convoy came by and all these Russian soldiers got out and picked our cars up and we set back.</p>
<p>It was important for Chris to get back to Budapest that night because he was the only Russian language officer - I guess one of the wives, but she wasn't there.  So that was our introduction of coming into Budapest.  And for reasons that I won't go into, we moved around from pillar to post the first year.</p>
<p>And I had another baby and Cardinal Mindszenty was then living in the Legation.  And I went out and brought the baby back.  In fact, coming back was rather fun.  I got on the plane in Frankfurt.  I had no place to live in Budapest so I out to have the baby in Frankfurt, taking my two little boys with me.  On the way back in the airport, I ran into the British Minister who was absolutely delighted, and when we arrived in Budapest, the entire British Legation was out there to meet their Ambassador.  And my husband, who had driven back with the two little boys.  Then the British Minister came off the plane carrying the Squire baby and there was much applause.  (laughter)  Now they don't have to go to the airport to meet everybody the way we used to do then which I think was kind of ...</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Let me ask you something about Mrs. Wailes when she said, “I want to meet my girls.”  Is she still alive?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
<p>SQUIRE:  No, no.  They both died.  Very soon together, one after the other.  Which was very sad, they were a wonderful pair.  Everybody loved them.  And then he didn't stay very long because we would not recognize the Hungarian Government.  But it was just a very exciting time and we must get somebody down who . . .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But how nice of her to want to meet all of you.  Where did it go from there?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Oh yes, she did.  She insisted that was all she wanted.  So except for the night they arrived in Vienna, Mrs. Thompson had gone to meet them and everybody felt to have her picture taken, at the border.  And then she insisted that they all come back - everybody was exhausted and the children were sick - that they come back to the Residence.  And that was the only time anybody was invited to anything until Mrs. Wailes came.  And then she didn't want to do anything but visit with us.</p>
<p>The men kept coming out.  Almost every night, somebody came out from Budapest and would be with us because they went back and forth.  Oh, I can remember terrible reports in the paper about unrest at the Yugoslav border and the water was polluted.  And the whole thing was going to erupt again.  And that night - somebody did call us every night - and Chris called and I said, “What's happening?”  And he said, “Oh, we've gone back.  I've moved in with Tom Rogers.  We're all out.  His freezer had hummed along through everything.  And we've just had steaks and a bottle of champagne.”  (laughter)  So the rumors went around Vienna that everything was terrible.  I mean things were awful, but no where near as bad as. . . .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So did you ever actually go and live in Budapest?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Oh yes.  I went back just before Christmas.  We were there for two years and at one point were going to be there for three because Ellis Briggs had asked for Chris in Greece and then they wouldn't let us go.  Oh no, they wouldn't let us extend in Budapest where they decided they'd keep us for a third year.  It was the same time, but we couldn't go to Greece because the language training didn't fit, something like that.  So we went to Brussels instead.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  That must have been quite a change!</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
<p>SQUIRE:  Oh, I can remember arriving in Brussels and everywhere we went, people said, “Oh, aren't you glad to be here?”  And we loved it in Hungary and you could go to little cafes and drink wine and everybody chatted with you and sang, even in those bad days when there was still a curfew when we first got there at night.  In Brussels we had a nannie, a Hungarian woman who had had to go out who'd been with us who joined us and went on to Brussels.  There was nowhere to go.  We weren't busy.  We really didn't know very many people.  We couldn't afford to go to the fancy Belgian restaurants and there was no place to sort of go and drink wine.  And I can remember saying to Chris, “If anybody says, 'Aren't you glad to be here?' I'm going to throw my drink at them,” because we were so homesick.  (laughter)</p>
<p>And then we met the three counts, men who had come out of Budapest who were in Brussels, and there were a lot of Hungarians.  We had a marvelous time.  The first part of our time in Brussels was made marvelous because of these Hungarians that we knew.  You've done an interview with Phyllis Freeman?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Hope did.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  I just wanted to say that they were just unforgettable characters.  We came down here to Washington for a week before we went to Brussels and everybody said, “Oh, you're so lucky to be going to Brussels to be serving under the fantastic Freeman and his marvelous wife Phyllis.”  And we were just sick hearing about them and thought that they were terrible.  (laughter)  Well we arrived, and they were just marvelous.  They turned this Embassy around from a place where the morale was very bad.  Chris's boss's wife said, “You've got to make your own life and your own friends.  This is the coldest Embassy,” - and he was about to retire - “we've ever been involved in.”</p>
<p>And the Freemans came in and Mary Lou Weiss said the other day, “Pat, you and Hope, I know so many people who were there in Brussels in those years who talk about it so fondly.”  And we were probably never with an Embassy that was closer.  And the Common Market was just moving in.  Ten months after we arrived in Brussels, they had a tea dance, the American Women's Club had a tea dance, and they invited 800 people, all the Americans in Brussels at that time, in Belgium, people at the seminaries and we all knew each other.</p>
<p>By the time we left, there were four or five thousand and heaven's knows how many people there are now.  So we were there when the women who had met their husbands during World War II and married and stayed in Belgium were still close to the Americans.  We were there as all the businesses began to come in.  It was a very good time to be in Belgium.  We look back on it.  Until we went to Australia, it was the only place where we had left friends in the country when we went back because both in Budapest and subsequently Moscow, you just didn't know many people.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  In Budapest when you went out to those cafes and drank wine.  Didn't it help that you were junior officers?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Oh of course.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  The Thompsons couldn't do that.  The Wailes couldn't do that.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Oh no.  When we got to the Soviet Union, we were able to do many more things in Moscow than we were able to do when Chris was Consul General in Leningrad.  Oh yes, of course.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So I maintain really that the best years of your career are when you're a junior officer.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Well I remember getting a letter from Sarah Rogers who I was talking about and Tom was permanent Charg� in Pakistan for quite a while and they had decided to retire.  She had wanted to get this doctorate in disadvantaged women.  And she said, “By far the best years are when you're a junior officer.”  Phyllis Freeman wrote back to Brussels when Tony went off to Columbia and says, “It's very lonely up here in this rarified air.”  They'd had much more fun, it's true.</p>
<p>But the people were such that you could just go up to the bar and sit in these little cafes and meet them.  They talked.  They never were frightened the way the Czechs were.  They burned their books.  They wouldn't have their history changed.  A lot of Hungarians stood up to the Russians.  More than probably - I'm prejudiced - they say the Poles did also, but they certainly did.  And this is why.  They did so much in 1956 that it should be documented, definitely.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Maybe you should talk to Mrs. Winn.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  I'd love to.  (End Tape I, Side A; Begin Tape I, Side B)</p>
<p>Back in Budapest and it may have been six months after the Revolution, they said we had to cut our staff down by a third very quickly.  So people who were leaving went out.  We cut all our Marine guards out.  We had two Air Attach�s, we cut out one.  We just cut the logical people.  And suddenly, as we sort of waved good-bye to all these people, we realized that every single Roman Catholic in the Legation had been sent out.  So we had nobody.  They were the ones who had taken care of the Cardinal.  And we had nobody.</p>
<pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
<p>It rather amused our Italian and French friends and even there were some Brits who were.  And they corrected it because everybody who came in subsequently was a Roman Catholic (laughter) to talk with Cardinal Mindszenty.  I guess I told you I took my baby back to be blessed by him.  So Margo was blessed by Cardinal Mindszenty.  So we had a very interesting time with him.  And then we had a Halloween party in the basement.  And we had cars running out on the two sides of the Legation - it was on a corner - and we had a car with a motor running all the time in case somebody ran out.  I mean I don't know what they expected.  So we laughed and said we should have everybody come in.  Oh, an Italian priest came in.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Now why were the cars running?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  In case somebody tried to smuggle the Cardinal out of the country.  They didn't know what was going to be going on, and when the Italians came in or when people came in, they were very nervous about us.  And there, if Chris and I went out and there was one car following him, at the next street light, there was a woman who materialized from somewhere so she could follow me into the ladies room.  We were constantly followed by people there also.  And I was scared when the children were brought home from school because Dick Selby would bring them one day and Chris the other, and when Dick left, these cars with the goons would come screaming around the corner following him and we had to have people out there making sure the children wouldn't be run over.</p>
<p>But my children had a wonderful time there.  I looked out in my garden one day and there were three little boys.  My five-year old and the son of the man from across the street who lived in an apartment to look at us, and the son of Hungary's leading heart surgeon who went in and out of prison.  And at the time of the Revolution, he talked with his wife and they made the decision to stay there because he said, “There are many people who can do what I can do in the West, but I'm the only doctor here.  And they do bring me out when there's an emergency.”  And these children played together very happily.  There was a freedom that was allowed much more so than ever with the Russians until the children were older I think.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So we've gone back and then shall we then go on?  Well I see after Belgium you went to the University of Indiana for a year and came back here for three years so you were in the United States for four years.  And then off to Moscow in '66.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Yes.  And went off as Science Attach�.  Now I think it's kind of a meaningless position, but at that time it was when all the space stuff. . .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I was going to say, when did Sputnik go off?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
<p>SQUIRE:  Well Sputnik went off when we were in Budapest and we watched that.  But our men walked on the moon and many things were happening at that time.  So that it was a very exciting time for Chris.  And after '66, we were there supposedly for two years and then we were extended for a year, and in '68 when the Russians went into Prague, we cut off all entertaining except us.  And they let us entertain because Chris was dealing with apolitical people, the scientists.  So that for really a couple of months we were about the only people in the Embassy doing any entertaining.  And then the Russians wouldn't come when they started it.  So we had a lot of contacts that immediately disappeared.</p>
<p>In 1969, we packed up and all our effects went off to Belgrade.  And we were leaving in about four days when they kicked out our new Economic Counselor.  I can remember somebody coming out of the elevator and saying, “When are you going to unpack?”  And I said, “Oh, I just had this awful thought myself.”  So that night I said to Chris, “Do you want to stay here?  Is there a question of our staying?”  And Chris said, “I told them I wouldn't do it to you.”  And he said, “Would you stay?”  And I said, “Yes.  I don't particularly want to go to Belgrade.  Margo will have to go off to boarding school.”  So we stayed in Moscow.</p>
<p>He became Economic Counselor.  Our man who had just been kicked out was sent as the Economic Counselor to Brussels.  The poor man in Brussels who had just put his children in the International School of Brussels was told he was going to Belgrade.  So I'm sure that he just hated everybody because he had to find schools for his kids and it was an awful time.  So we stayed on.  And we were there for four years.</p>
<p>At that time, when we finally left, for two weeks I was the American woman who had been there the longest since the War.  One of the correspondent's wives beat me a little while after that, but we were there for an awful long time.  But although we lived in this terrible apartment building, the business of serving in the Soviet Union, there was an esprit that we had as you well know.  And conditions - there was probably more to eat then than there is now.  I've gone in and out of the Soviet Union for so many years because of going on subsequently to Leningrad.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I notice then that Chris went to Vietnam and you were in Massachusetts and you came back here again.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
<p>SQUIRE:  And I think that this is something that should go down somewhere in case it ever happens again.  I've talked about this with a lot of people and I've never seen it in writing.  I went back to my hometown.  I knew people who just decided, “Well, I've never lived in Honolulu or I've never lived in Florida.”  They went off to places like that.  I think we were very much better off than those who came here to Washington or those who went out to the Philippines or Bangkok or wherever.  Those people were really neither fish nor fowl.  They only saw their husbands periodically.  People who came here to Washington, they were here without their husbands coming home.  We lived a life where the husband never worked.  I think it was much easier.  It was logical for me because my mother had died and I had a place to live in.  And the girls were younger and were with me and my boys were - one in Hanover and the other in Kent, Connecticut.  It was logical for me to go.  But it was awful that he went right after we left.  And the Department told him I was ready to resign even if he didn't.  (laughter)  They told him there was no other job for him and he had to go.  At the time, they were trying desperately to get him to go back to Budapest to be DCM which he was longing to do.  And they wouldn't release him.  So the Department wasn't very nice to us.  Although he was up in the Montenyard country and he loved the experience, so for him, it was not a bad thing.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And the separation doesn't seem to have unduly affected your family and it was for what, for two years?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Almost because he came down here and in the fall we went back and forth.  And then. . . No, and I think these were very bad years.  If my boys had been different, it might have been bad, but in a way. . . I can remember Paul saying, “You haven't said anything about drugs, Mom?”  And he said, “We talked about it and decided we both smoked pot.”  And I said, “I know that.”  And he said, “Neither of us is doing anything about hard drugs.  I don't know why Cass isn't.  But I like my life.  I don't want to do something that's going to hurt me down the road.”  So that was rather a nice thing.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And how old?  They must have been . . .</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  By that time Paul was a freshman at Yale and Cass a junior at Dartmouth.  And Cass got very involved in the strike and he also became a conscientious objector.  He had a low number, but he was deferred.  These are things that should go down in something.  He was deferred.  And I can remember sitting all by myself one morning while they called the numbers for Paul's age group.  They had the birthdays of his six best friends in town.  One was an asthmatic.  Everybody was up ithe 300's and mine had 49.  And I thought, “My husband's in Vietnam, my older son has a low number.  Why is this happening to me?”</p>
<pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
<p>Well Cass called from Hanover, and he said, “Mum, I think Paul, if he is going to register as a conscientious objector, he should do it now.”  And I said, “You know that's up to him.”  And he called me back the next day and said, “I'm going down to see him this weekend.”  So I didn't hear anything, and a few nights later, Paul, who was then a senior at Kent, called and he said, “Mum, aren't you anxious to hear about my weekend?”  And I said, “Yes.”  And he said, “Well I decided the only reason I would register as a conscientious objector was if I was afraid to go to Vietnam.  I'm not afraid to go to Vietnam.  Maybe I'm more conservative or more religious than Cass,” not that he is.  “But I'm not registering as a conscientious objector.”</p>
<p>And then he went on to Yale and subsequently after Chris was all back, Shockley - you know, the man who said that blacks are inferior to whites - came to speak in New Haven.  And they all began to clap and stamp.  And somebody fingerprinted about ten young men - not the girls - and he was one of them.  Well everybody signed a petition saying we'd all done it.  And Paul called and said what had happened.  And before we had a chance to say anything, he said, “I know it was wrong.  I lived with the Communists so long, I know I should have given him a chance to have his say.”  And we felt rather pleased with that.  And as we talked about it ourselves, we decided that we were responsible for the fact, really, raising him as we did, that he cared about this.</p>
<p>And he also said, “You know, I didn'join demonstrations when Dad was in Vietnam because I had a double loyalty.  I didn't like what was going on anymore than anybody else, but I had a loyalty to my father.”  And the fact that he was gone.  So I think this did something to the boys.  In a way it helped me to raise them on my own during those two years.  Anyway, he was suspended from Yale for the summer term, when he wasn't even going to be there.  The law faculty said this is very unfair.  Chris went up and Paul talked about it afterwards.  Really, he was the only parent who came while this trial was going on with these men who had stomped at Shockley.  In a way, we were proud of him.  Good kids.  Yes.  You know, they had their problems. . .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  They seem to have sorted them out more or less together and on their own which made it much easier for you, didn't it, at that time?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Oh yes, absolutely.  They were wonderful.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So you had those two years.  And then you had. . .</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
<p>SQUIRE:  We were here and those were my . . .  My oldest daughter was here and then she went off to Dartmouth and I just had the younger one.  And I became the Educational Chairman for the AFSA Board.  And because of that I was on the Foreign Service Educational and Counseling Center Board and I also attended the AFSA scholarship meetings.  And got to know Clark Slade.  A young woman was working for him who was finishing up her degree in social work, maybe did finish it.  And suddenly she left, very suddenly, to take on another job in the Midwest someplace.</p>
<p>And Chris was in Australia.  He was by Australian-New Zealand desk, and Clark Slade called and said, “Pat, would you like to come and work for me and do the scholarship program?  I helped Mary Jane do it last year, so I'll help you.  And then, although you're not a social worker, you can do the educational part.”  And I remember saying, “Oh, Clark,” and talking to my then twelve-year old who said, “You have to do it, you have to do it.”  So I went off and worked for AFSA and just loved that and loved working for Clark Slade.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And that was a paying job?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  That was a paying job.  And I did the scholarship program for two and a half years.  And I stopped at that point, and I loved it, and Chris said, “Well if I get assigned someplace that Tina can't go - who was thirteen, going to be fourteen, going into high school - I'll resign, retire.”  And I said, “Well obviously if we go someplace where she can, I'll go with you.”  So he worked very hard to get us to Australia.  So I obviously left.</p>
<p>But during that time, Clark Slade, who so many of us. . . Before I ever met him, I always knew he was there in case your children had any problem.  And it was amazing how this man brought out terribly disturbed, terribly unhappy children.  I never once - he was next to me, I couldn't hear what they were talking about, but you could hear voices, there'd be silence and he'd start to talk.  By the time the hour was over, the young people were talking to him.  It was just a tremendous gift this man had.</p>
<p>So that when a group of women wanted him to concentrate more on the schools, it was wrong because loads of people can counsel schooling.  There were very few people as gifted as Clark was in helping the children who had really serious problems.  But at that time, I did the scholarship program and then talked with people.  Clark was not there full-time nor was I, so that when I was there and he wasn't and people came in unexpectedly. . .</p>
<pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
<p>The reason that he was there at AFSA and was there for so many years rather than doing anything at the Department was for privacy.  People were afraid of talking to people in the Embassy.  I can't believe they are today because the whole Department - there are so many more psychiatrists with FLO.  Clark himself went over there with the drug and the alcohol rehabilitation program.  People are talking more freely about bad marriages and not having anything happen to their careers.  But people were scared, so they could come and talk to Clark and not be. . .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  He was just one step removed.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  He was one step removed at AFSA, yes.  And this was why AFSA first hired him to come.  And I loved the man dearly and it was just a wonderful experience.  And then he refused to concentrate totally on schools, although he knew a tremendous amount about boarding schools and the private schools.  He was more interested in the private school and boarding school.  He really did not know a great deal about special education in the Washington area, feeling that there were a great many people who did to whom you could take your child.  And also, do it through the Department.  This was nothing to be ashamed of if you had a learning-disabled or deaf child or something like that.  He was eased out and went to work for the Department actually.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And Bernice Muncie came in.  I was aware of that.  And I believe I was doing things with Susan McClintock - that was pre-FLO.  Susan and I were drafting a proposal to FLO at that time and she was working with Bernice Muncie.  And so I was aware that this happened.  Now, maybe you don't want to name names, but just for history, who were the five women and did they know what they were talking about?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  I'll write those down, I think it's better.  No, they did not know and they would come to meetings with a pre-conceived idea and they would announce what Clark was doing.  Their idea was that he was spending much too much time with the counseling part of it and not doing the educational counseling.  And I'd say, “Look, at least half of his time is on schools.  He takes care of everybody who really wants to come and talk about schools.  We just don't have the tremendous files and all of this that you want.”</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Did that group of women come from AAFSW?</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
<p>SQUIRE:  Yes, and they had been on the Board.  I can't even think of Margaret whose husband was an Ambassador in the Middle East for many years.  I've kind of blocked them out.  Carolyn Holmes.  They just were determined to get in.  They were the ones who found Bernice.  And I'd say, “This isn't the way it is.  This is not the way it is.”  They'd go right on.  They were just determined to get him out.  And why?  I just don't know.  It nearly broke his heart.  It was an awful thing.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  I knew that was going on.  It's good to have that on. . .</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Well, I was prejudiced, but I was there seeing what he was doing.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And you saw what the results of his counseling were.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  And again, as I was saying earlier, so often people, particularly during the summer, people who had not made an appointment would call and just say, “We're passing through town.  Can we just come.  We've got to talk about schools.”  And nine times out of ten he squeezed these people in.  And they weren't interested in the schools.  They wanted to talk about their alcohol problem or their marriage.  And you could just get them to go and see. . .  I was not to do this counseling.  They could come back and talk to Clark.  Often that was enough, because I'd say, “Look, go and talk to so and so.  Here are suggestions.”</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You'd send them over to Med. . .</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Med or, yes.  He was doing this kind of thing.  Helping hurting people.  At that time there wasn't anybody else who was doing it.  Janet Lloyd took over for me doing both the scholarships and working with Bernice.  And she became the first FLO.  So it kind of shifted and then they closed down except for the scholarship stuff in AFSA.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So then everything shifted over to FLO with the opening of the FLO office in '78?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Yes.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And by that time you were in. . .</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
<p>SQUIRE:  We were in Australia, yes.  Where I continued to do a lot because as you undoubtedly know in English-speaking countries throughout the world, we have very little assistance and it was amazing to me.  People are going to the local schools so there isn't an American high school where they can go and take their SATs.  People had very little information about what to do.  And people who had spent 10, 12 years out hadn't bothered to find out enough, I think.</p>
<p>So I set up the SSATs for the first time and got everybody to do that.  Everybody went down to Sydney from Canberra.  We got it set up at the Boy's Grammar School so that they could take their SATs.  I did the Law Board interviews.  I got the international baccalaureate, too late for my own, but got that started in Canberra.  Did a lot of things.  And had calls from people all over Australia for advice just because I had done all these things.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  The Department assumes because it's in English, it's all taken of.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  It's all taken care of.  It wasn't and I'm sure that this was exactly the same in South Africa and certainly it was in New Zealand, Rhodesia.  Any of the English-speaking countries where there was adequate high schooling people stayed.  Of course in the old days, we didn't any of us get enough school allowances.  You get this from a lot of people.  But eventually they said that those of us living south of the equator could send our children home the last two years of high school.  And although she was having the most wonderful time anybody could socially, my youngest came home to boarding school at the very last minute and got into Concord because she had taken the SSAT and done very well.  You don't need to go into all the educational bit.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  But I did want to back up to when you were working with Clark.  I noticed you were here in '73 to '77.  It was right after the Directive.  Do you think the Directive had anything to do with the. . .</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  The way the women felt?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  The way the women felt or their attitudes?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Well, of course there was an awful lot of talk about it at that time.  But this was a separate situation because it wasn't women as much as it was just everybody that was involved.  Do you think it was?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well, you see I was in Cura�ao at the time.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
<p>SQUIRE:  Well, I went to meetings.  I was on the Mental Health Committee and I went to a lot of meetings because I was the logical person to have go, working with him.  And I can remember that these young women who were the ones who kind of got this thing. . . I remember one of them saying there was no feeling of community in a foreign post and I was really not a part of them, I was just an observer.  And finally, thinking of the places where I'd lived and we'd had such a sense of community, and I said, “Where have you been?”  And she'd only been to Mexico City.  Of course there's never. . . .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  There's never. . .  Either pre-'72 or after '72, there's never going to be. . . (pause)</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  We're back in Brussels and talking about calls and the days when people made calls.  And in Brussels, we had a list of everybody in the Embassy, and you called on everybody above you and everybody below you called on you, and between 4:30 and 5:30 in the afternoon, you were supposed to be prepared at home.  And if you weren't at home, people would just leave a card and they had made their effort.</p>
<p>One day when we hadn't been there very long, I had called on the various missions and this was the wife of the Minister to the Common Market who returned my call and appeared on an afternoon.  We were in a pension.  I had a nanny who was off.  I had two little boys running around naked and a small child in the bathtub when they sent her up.  She wasn't even announced.  Well, she went in and dressed the boys and told them stories and stayed for a couple of hours.  We had a cup of tea and of course we were friends from then on.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It was probably one of the most enjoyable calls she ever had.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Well, she was missing her own family and this was wonderful, one of the funny sides of making a call.  It was hard always to be prepared if you were home to have somebody appear at your house.  Fortunately, most of the ones who called on you were the ones who were junior to you, so I was somewhere in the middle of that.</p>
<p>Now I'm going to jump back to going to Moscow to talk about an amusing situation.  My mother died very quickly of leukemia just before we left so I really shut the door of her apartment, half a house, this was 1966, and went off because we were spending three weeks in Italy and then three weeks crossing Eastern Europe so that Chris could go to all of the embassies to discuss science matters.  And I was coming back with our older son who was coming back home to boarding school at the end of the summer and we called Chris's mother who was newly widowed out in Australia who was planning to come to visit us fairly soon after we got to Moscow.</p>
<pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
<p>Chris told her that my mother had died and would she come in the fall?  And she said, “Oh, I'll wait until you're settled.  I'm come out after Christmas.”  So he hung up and he said, “We've got to call her and explain our situation.”  So before we had a chance to call her, she called back and she said, “I think you need me.”  And he said, “Oh yes, Ma, we do.”  So she came.  And the day after or two days after she arrived, Cass and I took off.  And she unpacked all of my things.  It was the one and only time we didn't have a strike, we got our stuff immediately.</p>
<p>And we had this apartment that was two apartments put together like most Russian apartments.  And we had two balconies.  One off of a little bedroom shared the balcony with the kitchen of the next apartment which was in another entryway.  And she became very friendly with a Yugoslav.  I don't know how they communicated.  But she seemed to be able to talk to anybody anyway which my children loved.  She was a very independent lady.  She had wives doing things they'd never done before as a former Foreign Service wife herself.</p>
<p>Anyway, she then went away and two years later she came back and asked how the Yugoslavs were and I said, “Oh they've moved.  And for the last year it's been just a transient apartment, but now somebody seems to have moved in.”  So she said, “You must go and call on them.  This is your fire escape.  You can go over the balcony into their kitchen.”  She badgered us.</p>
<p>So Sunday morning, Chris and I went and rang the doorbell at this apartment and a beautiful young lady answered the door and he started in Russian to say who he was and she said, “Oh, do you speak English?”  And they had just come from India and she didn't know any Russian so we were ushered in and she said, “Well, my father isn't here, but my mother. . . “  And her mother came out and said, “Oh my goodness, the first in my country,” and she came from the southern part of Yugoslavia.  She said, “The first person who comes to call becomes like a member of your family.”  And so we explained why we were there and so forth.  And she went out and looked at the balcony and the next night, he was the new Economic Counselor in the Yugoslav Embassy, and the next day we got a dinner invitation.</p>
<p>And we really did become terribly close because of the fact that we had gone to call on them.  And I was explaining earlier, I don't know whether you taped it, that their son was dating Tito's granddaughter.  And I think we mentioned the fact that it's too bad the security situation being what it is now that it's very difficult for people to go in and out.  And so my children would bring this young woman into the Embassy to see movies and she just loved it and it was very interesting to us because we'd hear about all the things that were going on with her grandfather.  It worked both ways.  It was very nice.  I think that's all I wanted to say on that point.  What else did you want me to do?</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Then we would leap ahead to Canberra.  Canberra and Leningrad are the two things that we haven't touched on.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
<p>SQUIRE:  We went out to Canberra in '77 and it was just when the questionnaire came out about the '72 Directive.  And I literally arrived as it arrived and so I called Helen Davis, the wife of the Consul General in Sydney and said, “I can send this out, but I won't know the situation except by the way the women answer it.  What did your women say?”  And she said, “Everybody is having such a good time in Australia.  Everybody has nice housing, people play tennis and golf and bridge and they can pop their children in and out of a local daycare center whenever they feel like it.  So nobody's interested in working.”</p>
<p>And I found the same situation.  They had these marvelous houses.  They were having such a good life and they wondered when they'd ever have it again which is probably true.  So we couldn't even fill PIT positions.  That was very interesting.  We started a FLO because we had a room near the front door to the Embassy and people would come in and talk.  When we were getting ready to have a bake sale to raise money, people would just come in and talk.  And people were interested in finding out about where to live in this lovely city.  You could live anywhere.  But they were interested in schools.  So we started it more as a resource for that kind of information than to help people.  (interruption)  And it was true.  People came in and we kept files for newcomers because as you well know, the easier a post, the happier a post, the less is done for you.  I mean very few things are done for you in a good post.  A hardship post, people are there to meet you and help you and answer your questions.  In a post like Australia with the world's friendliest natives, very little is done.  You're on your own.</p>
<p>And we had some sad situations because of that.  Most people didn't need any help at all.  Some people did.  And we weren't aware of it until we got started with that even in a place where the climate, the food and the people and the everything was so marvelous, there were still unhappy people of course who were there.  I was also mentioning earlier there that I wished the Overseas Briefing Center - I hope they are now telling political wives which is just about all you have in Australia - be told that this is a club - the other diplomatic chiefs of mission to the career people.</p>
<p>We arrived and the Swiss Ambassador and his wife had been with us in Prague in our tiny little community.  Then he was the Deputy Chief of Mission in Moscow when we were there.  And then he's the Ambassador with his wife toward retirement.  And she had a tea and introduced me to all kinds of people.  It was kind of like having a mother figure there.  Our Ambassador's wife, who was a lovely lady and a very intelligent lady couldn't quite handle it.  I mean she didn't know anybody, she'd never lived in their countries.  I don't think people are meaning to be standoffish.  It just is a club and they should realize this when they get in.  And we didn't spend much time together obviously in a country like that, nor did our children, but we enjoyed each other when we got together, both the American community and the diplomatic. . .  I don't like people to say, “Oh I never saw any Americans or I never saw. . .“That's some kind of reverse snobbism or something.</p>
<p>
<pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Yes that's exactly what it is.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  It is nice and you do learn about a country through the eyes of the other people.  No question.  But we didn't spend very much time in Australia.  I talked at the beginning about how wonderful it was for us that Chris had so many contacts from back in his childhood.  In fact, kind of a funny story.  I think if he had his life to live over again, he might have been a geologist, or he'd liked to have been both.  He certainly was an amateur geologist so he loved Australia.  He became a very good friend with the head of the Department of Minerals in Canberra.</p>
<p>And he and our son went to one of the two largest opal-mining areas when the temperature was up to like 115, 120, in the middle of the Australian summer because Paul was there.  There was no other time for them to go.  And they were sent with a letter of invitation.  This Australian had called them to say they were coming.  People treated them very nicely the first night, and then were very withdrawn.  And, oh for two days, and they were going to be there for four or five days.  And finally they said to Paul, “How come you and your father don't talk the same way?”  And Paul said, “Oh, you mean my dad sounds like an Australian because he grew up here.  So when he comes back, it all comes flooding out.”  Then they relaxed because they thought he was from their equivalent of the Internal Revenue Service.  (laughter)  They thought he was an Australian.  Snooping on them!</p>
<p>One could go on and on and on about Australia.  We just really didn't have the problems except for being so terribly far away.  We had no problems at all.  In fact, we were supposed to be there another year and the Ambassador was away at Thanksgiving and Chris had a call to go into the Embassy Thanksgiving morning.  And he called me up and he said, “What do you think about going to Leningrad?”  And he said, “Come in, I want to talk about it because I've got to call back.”  So we loved it in Australia and he loved it.  And I went in and he was glowing like a Christmas tree.  The idea of going back to the Soviet Union.  This was a tremendous pull.  A few people really hate it.  Most people go back.  No question, if they get given the opportunity.  And so I said, “You would love to go to Leningrad.  The children would all enjoy it.”  I had three Russian studies majors in college because of our time in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So we left a year early and went to Leningrad and everybody was feeling so sorry for us.  And I can remember arriving in Leningrad and being very lonely in the beginning because we were very small.  We had no other English language people.  And I think we had the Germans and the French and the Finns and the Japanese and the Italians.  We were the only Western countries who were there.  And my first Australian guests - all the Australians came to see us because it was on their way around - said, “What you need Pat is a mate.”  And I found a mate in the German Embassy for a while.  And then my girls came so I wasn't lonely anymore.  But we didn't know an awful lot of Russians.  Chris was busy.</p>
<pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
<p>I was walking along out by the dacha out by the Bay of Finland and it was snowing and just absolutely beautiful.  And I thought, “You know, Canberra may be the nicest climate in the world, but I love the snow.  And this is so beautiful.”  It was wonderful being there.  And it was a fascinating time.  Rebecca Matlock says in her tape that she was always in Moscow during the “up times.”  Well, we were always there during the bad times.  These were very bad years again.  But it was a very interesting experience.  Of course we lived in this small Romanoff palace which was just absolutely extraordinary.  What else about Leningrad?  Now it's very interesting for me, because not having recognized . .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  You were just there.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Well I just was, but not having recognized the Baltic countries, our Ambassador never went to the Baltic countries, so the Consul General in Leningrad went three or four times a year.  And we could drive to Tallinn.  And so I went.  And when the children were there, he took them.  I didn't always go.  But we got so we knew people well in these countries and so I'm very sympathetic and very interested in everything that's going on in the country.  And certainly the strong feeling even amongst the Communist government officials wanting this independence and talking quietly when they were away from the microphones and so forth.  It was very interesting.  I don't know what else to say about Leningrad.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  One thing we don't have on tape.  We talked about it at lunch was how you set up the CLO in Canberra and how that all came about.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Well it came about because we wanted school information.  And we did it that first year.  There were a lot of unpaid CLOs.  And then we got money. . . The first time I turned it down.  The wife of our Station Chief was helping me and she was busy also and we both wanted to be able to work or not work and not feel responsible to a job.  And we weren't exactly sure what was needed.  It sort of explained itself, not being a hardship post.</p>
<p>And then we had some alcohol problems.  And we wanted to be able to hire a young wife who had worked in alcohol rehabilitation, so hoping that somebody would come in and talk.  Certainly one of them did, and we were able to get a lot of medical advice that we hadn't realized was important.  And a lot of school advice.  We talked about that, I think.  The fact that, living in the Southern Hemisphere so little is done to help people - didn't I say this? - going to English language schools.  So it's kind of assumed that everything is all right and they know about everything.  Well they don't.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Well I'm not sure if it all got on tape or not.  I can't remember if that was lunchtime or tape.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
<p>SQUIRE:  Well, it can certainly be cut out.  But I think it's kind of important that people realize that there is nobody to tell you about the SATs and the SSATs if you don't know about them, and the deadlines.  And how much they will do for you.  I was lucky having worked for Clark Slade and then also I'd worked at Princeton before I was married for the College Boards, and the man who'd become head of administration worked in my office with me in the old days, 1947 maybe?  So I could get most anything I wanted out of Princeton which was a big help.  And that's why the CLO I'm sure is still going on for different reasons than it would in a hardship post.  Nobody needs a tour.  Nobody needs any kind of a program planned for them, but they do need to know what doctor to get and where to send a child to school.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  One thing I think is interesting on your biographical sheet is that you have as “profession”, you have mathematics.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Well I majored in math.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And you haven't even mentioned math except to say that you've done your taxes!  (laughs)</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Well I majored in math at Vassar because it was the War and there was something that was easy to major in and I loved it.  And I could have done other things with an economics minor.  And then I went to work as a test constructor in Princeton.  And then I did teach school in Prague.  And have done some math tutoring.  But I really haven't used it and certainly I would be a psychiatric social worker if I had my life to live over again I'm sure.  Which I guess is just touching briefly on the situation of the tandems, having a tandem daughter.  I think it's important for these young wives to have a career or get themselves a career that they can transfer.  Because they can't just do one low-level job after another and be happy in today's Foreign Service whereas. . .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It's interesting how quickly those PIT jobs are just no longer. . .</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  No, and they're going to wake up at 40 and think, “What have I done with my life?”  And yet there are certain things you just cannot be and move around.  It's very hard for a lawyer.  You can go some places, but there are other places where you just can't do it, whereas this kind of counseling or teaching or one of these skills that they're comfortable in can go on and you could use everywhere you go.  I'm interested in that now.</p>
<pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
<p>And I think I also mentioned that I was sitting at the British Embassy one day with a very nice woman.  And we must have been bored.  She was all up in arms about the fact that her wives couldn't work here, but one had sailed in with a special kind of pediatric skill and of course the government wanted her, so she was allowed to work.  So we decided we'd have a meeting.  And we each got together ten people and we sat - the British wives and the American wives - and we got the first “right-to-work” bi-lateral agreement.  We badgered Immigration, we badgered the State Department and Foreign Office and so forth.  Well I feel as though we were the beginning.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Which one of your tours was that?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  That must have been - isn't that awful, I can't. . .</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  '73 - '77?</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Or the 60's.  It has to have been.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Or '63 - '66.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Yes, either then or it has to have been one of those two, certainly.  End of Tape I, Side BTape II, Side (starts in middle of tape)</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  And that second tour, the FLO would have been open.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Yes, and by then I think we had.  Well, no the FLO, no it didn't.  The FLO opened in '78.  So it may have been early on in that.  Because I was on the Board of AFSA, and then working, it may have been. . .  I don't know why I was at the coffee, it doesn't matter.  It'd be interesting to see what the date was.  I left and then they went on with it, but it was an interesting group.  And to think where that goes today.  And anybody can work who wants to.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Now, I know we don't have on tape because we just talked about it at lunchtime about your interest in maternity leave now.</hi>
</p>
<pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
<p>SQUIRE:  Oh, right now I'm interested in it, yes.  Very interested to see what happens.  I was in Moscow for five weeks visiting my daughter who is a tandem.  And she had lost a baby in the fall so she was interested in this, but not personally although she wanted to have a family.  And I found out there were twelve pregnant women in the Embassy in Moscow.  So I certainly was one of the letters.  And the Newsletter asked for suggestions for the Forum.  And so I thought, “Well, this is certainly a women's topic.  And something we could sort of get our teeth into.  It's not going to cost millions of dollars.”  And we are going to discuss it at the next Forum.</p>
<p>And my daughter is USIA and I was talking to a young woman who said, “I'll come with you.  I went through this.”  And then I've had two British wives - one who was head of the Women's Association in the British Foreign Office who both thought our system was archaic - not being able to take just guaranteed administrative leave.  They can take off a year in both Foreign Affairs and Domestic Service, unpaid leave, and they get much longer paid leave.  Well these twelve women in Moscow were interested in administrative leave.  And it would seem to me that. . .  We're always changing careers, we're changing jobs, so to be able to take off a tour to have a family would seem to me not to hurt anybody.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  It's logical.</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Very logical.  And then be able to go back.  It doesn't matter to everybody, but secretaries now are tenured, they're Foreign Service.  Some of the people are doing PIT jobs all the way along and they automatically get a job or can work back in Washington.  My daughter is a Foreign Service Officer, an FSIO.  She loves what she's doing, just loves it.  And you've got an investment in these people that it would seem to me. . .  I'll say this and you'll find out what happens, but I think we've got to give. . .  And also the British do a lot of part-time work which they have found very successful.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  So that will be your topic at the. . .</hi>
</p>
<p>SQUIRE:  Well, they may have this all down, I've just been so glad that they're going to do it.  I just want to be sure that they have the regulations as far as the British Service is concerned because, you know, we all still have kind of a little inferiority complex about the British.  If the British are doing this. . .  So the Swedes are, so the Spanish, so whatever.  But if the British are doing this, we sit back and think, “Why are they doing it and we aren't?”</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italics">Q:  Right.  (laughs)</hi>
