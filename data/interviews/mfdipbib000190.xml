                        us a complete background on yourself, please.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: I was born in Michigan and I went to the University of Michigan in the
                    early ''40s prior to entering the army. Then I completed my bachelors and I got
                    a masters in political science at the University of Michigan after the army. In
                    1949 I competed along with a lot of other people for the position of State
                    Department Intern. I did want to get into the Foreign Service, that much I knew.
                    I had picked up a love for foreign affairs while I was in the army and I had
                    specialized in Soviet Affairs in my university studies after the war. Primarily
                    because I observed the trouble we were having with the Soviets in Korea while I
                    was in the occupation of Japan. It seemed to me that the Soviet-American
                    relationship would be paramount in my experience. I was only 20, 21, at that
                    time but I did make that decision and followed through when I went to Michigan,
                    learning Russian. I became a teaching fellow in the Russian language for the
                    last year and a half I was in Ann Arbor teaching both at University of Michigan
                    and at Wayne State University in Detroit. So I considered myself a Soviet expert
                    and actually applied at the CIA for a job and got an offer. However, at the same
                    time, I got an offer to become a State Department Intern, and I decided that I
                    preferred overt diplomacy to the covert side. I took the State Department
                    Internship and went to Washington in 1950. So I really had no professional
                    experience in between my university education and entering the State Department.
                    At that time, of course, there was no USIA, this was 1950.</p>
                <p>1950: Shift From Department of State Internship To Kreis Resident Officer Program
                    In HICOG</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I came to Washington and spent about 7 weeks as an intern and heard about the
                    Kreis Resident Officer program in Germany. Germany was still occupied at that
                    time, although the occupation was coming to an end. The Federal Republic of
                    Germany had been founded the fall of 1949. We were still doing some work with
                    the Germans as far as the construction of their society was concerned and the
                    Kreis Resident officers were the representatives of the State Department at the
                    county level in Germany. I heard about that program and it appealed to me very
                    much. I was interviewed and accepted and went from the Intern Program right into
                    a Kreis Resident Officer training program which took me to Germany in the winter
                    of 1950-1951.</p>
                <p>The Kreis Resident Officers, there were 165, maybe 157, were the brain child of
                    John J. McCloy, who was the American High Commissioner for Germany, and Shep
                    Stone, who was his director of public affairs. We essentially were engaged with
                    Germans in helping them to construct a democratic society at the community
                    level. We used our own experience, the experience of American experts who were
                    brought over by the American Military Government at first and then later on by
                    the Embassy. It was a huge program and was one of the pivotal experiences of my
                    life. I spent the first year and a half of that tour in Germany as a KRO, as we
                    were called. I learned how to deal with a language that was not native to me. I
                    learned German, which I think became quite good, and I learned how to handle a
                    variety of aspects of democratic society which I had perhaps practiced in the
                    United States but was not really so aware of. It was a great educational
                    experience for me. And I think it was quite a profound experience for the
                    Germans.</p>
                <p>I jump now for a moment to the present. German academics specialists are now
                    getting into the study of that era and I am encouraged to find that they are
                    finding that our efforts were beneficial to the construction of German
                    democracy.</p>
                <p>Catherman's Philosophic Evaluation Of American Accomplishments In Germany In
                    Early Post War Era</p>
                <p>So I have a philosophy about that era. I spent four and a half years in Germany
                    my first time, and my philosophy is the following. The Americans pursued a triad
                    in their foreign policy in regards to Germany. For one thing, we had the
                    Marshall Plan, of course, and that was the big money game. The success story was
                    patent. We saw the Germans come through with their “Wirtschafts- wunder,” as
                    they called it, their economical miracle.</p>
                <p>So we had that and, of course, we had our security policies which very quickly
                    involved the Germans. By 1952 the great debate about the form that the new
                    German army would take and how it would be incorporated into NATO was going full
                    blast. We did bring the Germans into NATO and they did once again form a very
                    efficient military establishment.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>So those were two legs of the triad. The third leg of the triad, essentially was
                    democratization. It was a big effort. When the Americans were going full blown
                    in Germany we had about 350 Americans and about 4,000 Germans devoted to this
                    effort. In addition to the Kreis Resident Officers we also had 52 Amerika
                    Ha�ser, so-called America Houses, which were full-blown American cultural and
                    information centers, usually with one or perhaps two Americans running each one,
                    and a competent German staff. There was a library, a full-blown film program,
                    cultural program, concerts by Americans and much, much information about how the
                    Americans run their democratic society.</p>
                <p>Shep Stone had told me just before he died that he had a budget which was roughly
                    $50 million a year to run this program. So it was big and I take pride in having
                    participated in that.</p>
                <p>1952: Catherman Leaves Kreis Resident Officer Ranks To Become Amerika Haus
                    Director In Heidelberg; Then To Bonn</p>
                <p>After I left the KRO ranks I became America House director in Heidelberg, 1952-53
                    and then went on to Bonn to run, what we called a speakers and artists
                    programming office which essentially made available to a variety of German
                    institutions, and of course the American institutions which were big in West
                    Germany at that time, prominent American speakers and performing artists who
                    were interested in coming to Germany to show what America has to offer.</p>
                <p>Post OMGUS Information Program Under HICOG Began As Department of State
                    Controlled Operation, But Transferred To Newly Created US Information Agency In
                    August, 1953</p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: They were in the HICOG operation...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now at what point did the information program become
                        individualized and distinct from the Kreis Officer program? Shep Stone, I
                        think, headed up the information program or else he was a deputy, but he was
                        one of the top officers in there I know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Yes. He was the director of public affairs for John J. McCloy and this
                    all started in 1949. The military government ceased to exist when the Federal
                    Republic of Germany came into existence which was in October 1949. At that time
                    the High Commission for Germany which comprised the American High Commissioner,
                    the French High Commissioner and the British High Commissioner took over as
                    civilian representatives from the Military Government. General Lucius Clay had
                    been the American Military Governor prior to that. He left at the time that John
                    J. McCloy, a civilian, came in and took over the civilian component. Shep Stone
                    was his public affairs officer. He was responsible for all these informational
                    and cultural activities that I mentioned until...I think Shep Stone left that
                    job in 1952, but the primary impetus of that work continued until roughly
                    1955.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time it initially went in under the State
                        Department. It was an information program run by the State Department until
                        USIA became an entity in 1953.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: In August of 1953 USIA was established and those of us who remained in
                    the program became foreign service officers in the USIA. I have some theories
                    about that, but I don't know if you want to go on to that...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, why don't you go into it, because I think it is all
                        very pertinent background.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Right. USIA became the information and later on the cultural arm of
                    American diplomacy abroad. I just happened to be in Washington in the summer of
                    1953 on home leave from Germany, I went back to Germany then and spent 2 more
                    years there. So I was here when this whole play about the establishment of USIA
                    developed. My impression, this is my personal impression, is that USIA was
                    established essentially for negatives reasons. It was established because John
                    Foster Dulles simply did not want to face Joe McCarthy and his committee and
                    others in the Congress who were hearing, mostly from the Voice of America,
                    denunciations of their colleagues, people with whom they had disagreements about
                    philosophy or ideology. John Foster Dulles just decided to get rid of all of
                    that to purify the State Department, to make the State Department a vehicle of
                    the conduct of traditional diplomacy and move the information arm out of the
                    State Department.</p>
                <p>So USIA was established essentially under a cloud. There were people who had been
                    accused of disloyalty to the United States. Most of them were in the Voice of
                    America, but not all of them. I remember, for instance, that year Mr. Cohn and
                    Mr. Schine who represented Senator McCarthy, came to Germany and grilled the
                    Embassy's press attach�, who was a USIA member. They also grilled the director
                    of RIAS, Radio In America Sector, in Berlin who is, of course part of USIA and
                    several other USIA representatives including me, although they did not have any
                    particular ideological reason to talk with me. I was director of America House
                    in Heidelberg and they looked at the book collection there and were dissatisfied
                    to find, among other things, that Howard Fast was on the shelf.</p>
                <p>Well that was the atmosphere as I remember it when USIA was founded. I was not
                    particularly happy with that era and with the sort of foundation upon which our
                    Agency was built on in the beginning. I am glad to say it developed and created
                    its own positive raison d'etre fairly soon and then, in the late ''70s, when
                    John Reinhardt was Director, we also got the cultural side of American foreign
                    diplomacy when the State Department cut loose those cultural activities which
                    were assumed into USIA.</p>
                <p>At any rate, those first four and a half years of my diplomatic life were full of
                    this verve and excitement of watching a German society evolve into a democratic
                    one and a strong one economically. I even observed the beginning of the
                    establishment of the German military.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I was one of the first USIA foreign service officers to get an additional year of
                    education at the Russian Institute at Columbia. I did this primarily as a
                    preparation to going to the Soviet Union. That was in 1955.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to ask two questions. One has to do with the work
                        you were doing in Germany, really three questions. First of all, you said
                        that you were in the States at the time the Executive Order of August 1 or
                        3, I'm not sure which one it was, created the Agency. Were you given the
                        opportunity to elect whether to remain with USIA or return to the State
                        Department where you started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: We were transferred from the State Department automatically. I could
                    have protested that transfer and sought another job in the State Department, but
                    I chose not to essentially because I was involved in the work I was doing and I
                    rather enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The reason I ask the question is because I had been in the
                        State Department a couple of years before I went into the foreign service
                        with the information part. The change over occurred while I was in Japan. I
                        was given the option of staying with USIA or going back to the State
                        Department. I too elected to remain with the Agency because I felt that what
                        I was doing was so much more exciting than what I would be doing otherwise.
                        I guess because you had a shorter stay you would have had to make a
                        specific...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>

                    Society</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The second question that I want to ask is: I gather from
                        what you say that you felt the thrust of the program that you were in was
                        being highly successful in converting the German thinking over to a
                        democratic point of view and denying their Nazi background. You think it
                        made tremendous progress at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>CATHERMAN: I don't think they made tremendous progress. I am not a radical
                    thinker about our success there. I think we had a good success. The Germans who
                    were engaged in that process, for instance, the participants in the major
                    exchanges program, we had very large exchange programs with the Germans then. In
                    1951, for instance, we had almost 1,200 young German leaders visit the United
                    States for periods of up to six months. I think we can be satisfied that we did
                    a good job with competent people. I think we can be satisfied with what happened
                    to the German society. I can't quantify that any more. I don't think it was by
                    any means a sensational success. We did okay. It was worth the expenditure of
                    money and brain power that went into it. We have a stable democratic German
                    society with which we must deal now. It is not going to be easy to deal with the
                    Germans, but at least we have a democratic society, a society dedicated to
                    essentially the same approach to running public affairs as we Americans have.
                    That was certainly not guaranteed in the immediate post-war era.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, yourself, get into the educational institutions
                        and the work with the universities in Germany as a result of your work in
                        the America House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Yes, I did. At that time my main contact was with the University of
                    Heidelberg and we had an intensive relationship with the University of
                    Heidelberg. We facilitated an academic exchanges program between the University
                    of Heidelberg and several American universities. Helped them set up formal
                    agreements with American universities, used their professors in our programs and
                    supplied American academics for their university programs. I was very happy with
                    that academic relationship. And I must say it was good preparation for the
                    future because as I stayed on in the foreign service I became chairman of four
                    Fulbright commissions—the Israeli-American Fulbright Commission, the
                    Yugoslav-American, the French-American and finally the German-American Fulbright
                    Commission. So it was good training at the beginning. The relationship was very
                    active and very positive.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know whether you dealt with universities other
                        than at Heidelberg but did you feel any sense of underlying reluctance or
                        opposition to what we were trying to do in their universities or did they
                        accept it fairly well?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>CATHERMAN: They did not accept it, they never accepted it. I think what we can
                    attribute to our efforts at that time, the success side in Germany is the
                    opening up the universities. The universities ceased to become the elitist,
                    authoritarian institutions that they had been before. They became more
                    democratic, frankly more than I would have liked to see them, but then I am not
                    a German. By the time I came back in the ''70s to Germany and this last period
                    which ran over five years from 1985 -1990, I saw what I thought was a pretty
                    anarchistic situation in the German universities. They were overwhelmed with
                    students. They could not turn any students away and their concepts of democracy
                    essentially wiped away most discipline. In that respect the open universities,
                    as the Germans developed from the American idea went probably farther than I
                    would have liked. But at any rate, as far as university reform in the American
                    sense of the word, I would not say we were very successful. We encountered a lot
                    of resistance and I would certainly not list one of my successes as in reforms
                    at the University of Heidelberg. What we did do was supply an exchange of
                    academic professors and students and that is as far as my success extended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your experience with the professors from
                        Heidelberg University when they returned? Did they fall pretty much back
                        into the old German pattern or did it have some influence on them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Well, they were very frustrated when they returned. I think this can
                    be said of a lot of Germans, not only academics. They came to the United States
                    which was an enormously widening experience for them whether they were academics
                    or leaders in other aspects of American society and came back to see this sort
                    of cramped authoritarian tradition. Although it was breaking up it was still
                    there. The German society is a completely different thing than the experience we
                    have had here in the United States. I don't remember one single case of Germans
                    not being frustrated at their inability to get things moving in the academic
                    sphere. That applied across the board. Essentially they came back malcontent and
                    some of them devoted their lives after that to democratic reform with some
                    success. Others simply disappeared into the German society and went about their
                    lives. But there was a lot of discontent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Much the same thing I imagine happened in reference to the
                        library situation too where the libraries were open and they first saw an
                        example of an American open library. I don't know what the case is today,
                        have you found that they more or less reverted to the old pattern?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>CATHERMAN: That never took hold. That is another American reform that we worked
                    hard on, on the open shelf system, the open library. With a few exceptions, and
                    there were some, it did not take hold. The exceptions were essentially American
                    financed. For instance, the John F. Kennedy Library in Berlin is more open than
                    most. It was financed almost totally from American funding, from the Ford
                    Foundation essentially. There are a few of those around, the American Memorial
                    Library, again in Berlin, which was heavily financed by Americans is more open
                    to the public. Generally they are not, generally they are pretty much on tight
                    hold.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am glad to get your assessment of this because a
                        substantially large number of other people that I have interviewed from the
                        German program, who came away fairly early, left with the impression that we
                        had had much greater success in the long run than you seem to feel that we
                        have had. Probably your return trips to Germany refined your own thinking in
                        that regard more than the others had an opportunity to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Well, I think we did a good job. We simply had a lot of very good
                    people working. If I can just give you one example in the field of women's
                    affairs, the Nazi woman essentially was used as a breeding mare and had no real
                    role to play outside, sort of a toy for the men during the Nazi period. We came
                    in with a large and determined and very talented group of people to work with
                    German women and bring them up to having a sense of self respect. I think we did
                    a good job and certainly at this stage of the game the German woman is playing
                    as much of a role in the development of her society as is the American
                    woman—perhaps even more in the political sphere. I don't want to denigrate the
                    effort, the effort was substantial and there were some wonderful people
                    there.</p>
                <p>Maybe now is the time for me to say something I hold very deeply about that
                    generation of Americans who went to Germany with the intent of helping the
                    Germans form a democratic society. One of the things that really amazed me,
                    always right from the beginning, was the return of the Jew from the United
                    States to Germany. Some of the best people we had in that period were Jews who
                    had been forced to leave under harrowing circumstances in the ''30s and who came
                    back and sat down with the Germans and helped them democratize their society. It
                    was a remarkable thing for me to see. A phenomenon that I have not completely
                    resolved in my mind to this day because I know so many American Jews who would
                    never think of doing that, who certainly did not return, and who to this day
                    have not returned to Germany. But there was that group and they did some really
                    good work. It is something that I hope someone will look into some day.</p>

                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>CATHERMAN: The woman who stands out in my mind, she was the last major
                    contributor, was Mildred Allport. She was really quite a substantial figure and
                    played a big role in that period. But she came relatively late. She came in
                    1950, but she took over that job at the end of '51.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: She remained several years and she was a big figure, but also had some
                    good people with her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One final question before we go back to your training at

                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: I was not a student of German, I did Russian at the university. I had
                    about 2 1/2 months of concentrated German training in the Foreign Service
                    Institute in Washington before the group of KROs went to Germany. So I arrived
                    in Germany with a rudimentary speaking knowledge. But I kept working at it. Of
                    course I was thrown into a small community in lower Bavaria, Niederbeyern, where
                    I was the only American. My wife didn't come with me down there, so I spent over
                    a year as the only American within 30 kilometers.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Right. Pic Littell, my colleague from USIA, and I were the first
                    representatives to get an academic year at government expense for the honing of
                    our professional skills. In our case at Columbia University where we were both
                    in Soviet studies. This was 1955 and 1956.</p>
                <p>From the Russian Institute at Columbia University, Pic Littell went directly to
                    Moscow and opened a USIA office in our Embassy there. It was not called USIA as
                    the Soviets would not tolerate that. Pic had to essentially rejoin the State
                    Department and go as a State Department officer. At any rate he opened up an
                    operation in Moscow which was connected with USIA and soon after that began to
                    arrange for the publication of Ameryka magazine and started some rudimentary
                    exchanges programs with the Soviet Union.</p>

                <p>I went to Vienna and spent the next four years in Vienna operating one of the
                    more interesting things in my experience, a shop called the Special Projects

                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: It was not an integral part of the USIS program. My assignment there
                    was to monitor the East European, what we called satellite, radio and press in
                    those days, and also the media of the Soviet Union, and to get news items out of
                    those media and give them to the Western press covering the Soviet empire from
                    Vienna. In those days practically no journalists went into Eastern Europe, or if
                    they did get in they couldn't do their job because of the Stalinist approach to
                    the Western media. So we got information to them from the satellite and Soviet
                    media. I also had access to Embassy reports and other information sources. I
                    spent time briefing Western journalists, Americans and others about how we saw
                    things developing in the satellite empire.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Yes. Although they had a far bigger monitoring effort than we did. We
                    did supply a lot of information to them. We had a good working relationship with
                    them and we got their reports back. Now they were much bigger and more complete.
                    We were a quick moving operation. When we received a news report that looked
                    good we got it out right away. Our advantage and our strength was that we could
                    move fast. We were small. I think there were 15 of us in that shop.</p>

                <p>CATHERMAN: The only American until 1959 when Phil Arnold joined me. He became one
                    of the PAOs in that area later on. Phil and I were colleagues for two years
                    until 1961 when I was assigned to the Soviet Union. In 1959, I went to the
                    Soviet Union as a member of the staff of our national exhibition there. This was
                    the first major USIA and US Government effort to open the Soviet Union. We spent
                    the summer there and played host to hundreds of thousands of Soviets. The
                    Soviets also had their exhibition in the United States, in New York. That was
                    the start of American public diplomacy in the Soviet Union. Some had been done
                    before by Pic Littell and also Tom Tuch, Tom was my immediate predecessor in
                    Moscow, but that was the big one. The New York Philharmonic with Leonard
                    Bernstein came during that period. We had other large performing arts groups. We
                    really got going in the cultural and information side of things in 1959.</p>

                <p>CATHERMAN: Lee Brady was there. He was Tom Tuch's boss. The reason I mentioned
                    Tom first was that I had a personal friendship with Tom and I always followed,
                    or almost always followed, Tom in assignments. For instance, I replaced Tom in
                    Moscow, later on I replaced him in Berlin, then I replaced him as Deputy
                    Director of the Voice of America in the early ''80s. And then, finally, I
                    replaced Tom as country PAO in Germany. Lee was there and was Tom's boss. He was
                    certainly one of the big elements in that program, although Lee himself was not
                    a Soviet specialist. He was seconded into the Soviet program from other
                    interests. He was a marvelous French linguist and had had years in France and
                    returned again some time after leaving the Soviet Union. I was dedicated to
                    Soviet Affairs. Pic Littell who had been there prior to Lee's arrival as the
                    only USIS person was dedicated to Soviet Affairs. Lee came in after that and
                    then left, he never returned to Soviet Affairs. He did some great things
                    otherwise.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went for the summer for the first American
                        exhibit, which I gather was the one where the so-called kitchen debate took
                        place,...</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you then leave the Soviet Union for awhile and then go
                        back?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Yes, I went back to my job in Vienna. I still had two years to go
                    there. I came back to Moscow in 1960 to replace both Tom Tuch and Lee Brady
                    while they went on home leave. I spent the entire summer of 1960 there. In the
                    meantime my operation in Vienna was beginning to change its nature. The iron
                    curtain was beginning to open a little bit and the USIS personnel who were by
                    that time assigned to the embassies in the satellites and the Soviet Union were
                    able to take selected information about the American cultural experience and get
                    it into the hands of people in the Soviet Union who were willing to take the
                    risk of getting this kind of information. I changed that operation, which had
                    been a cold war effort in Vienna, around and made it more of a purveyor of
                    cultural news about the United States for peoples in Eastern Europe and the
                    Soviet Union. We began to put out cultural bulletins. We began to build small
                    exhibits. We had panel displays for show windows in front of the embassies in
                    those countries and so on. That developed later on into a major effort. So I was
                    happy to see that happen.</p>
                <p>May, 1961: Kennedy-Khrushchev Meeting In Vienna Followed Immediately By Transfer
                    To Moscow</p>
                <p>Then two days after the Kennedy-Khrushchev meeting in Vienna May of 1961, Dottie
                    and I drove from Vienna to Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, you were able to drive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: We were able to drive. We were one of the first ones to do it and it
                    took three days, but we made it. I remember that period very well because I was
                    sleeping on my desk down at the press office during the Kennedy-Khrushchev
                    meeting—for two days—and Dottie was packing. A typical foreign service
                    experience. She had the packers and I had all that going on. That was a very
                    exciting meeting—the young President, John F. Kennedy and the sort of grizzled,
                    party stalwart Nikita Khrushchev. I was assigned to Pierre Salinger, who was
                    Kennedy's press speaker and I spent most of the time in the kitchen of the
                    ambassador's residence or in the waiting room of the Soviet Embassy when the
                    meetings took place there. Pierre would come out and hand me something about
                    what was going on inside and I would take that and read it to the press. Make
                    sure AP and UPI got it and also that it was sent down to the press center where
                    hundreds of journalists were covering that event. So I played my little role in
                    that. I also got some pictures of myself taken by the CIA which they later
                    presented to me. Ernie Wiener sent them to me. He was there with me also. Ernie
                    and I are in several of those pictures together. Ernie and I sort of had a beat
                    of keeping track of Pierre Salinger and making sure that the information he
                    wanted relayed from the site of the talks to the press in fact was delivered. So
                    that was my job there.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Then I went to Moscow for three years. Those were the years of the opening. The
                    national exhibit in 1959 had set the scene. We concluded exchanges and cultural
                    agreements after that. By the time I got to the Soviet Union in May of 1961 we
                    already had a traveling exhibit in the Soviet Union and I took that over for the
                    summer, that was an exhibit on plastics, we had 30 Russian-speaking American
                    guides and I took that exhibit over for its showing in Moscow and Tbilisi.
                    Dottie and I were on our way to Tbilisi on a hot August day of 1961. We had
                    stopped off for two days in Sochi which is a Black Sea resort in the Soviet
                    Union. We tried to get a little swimming in and actually spent almost all day
                    trying to find food; it was tough standing in line trying to get something to
                    eat there. We came back to the hotel on that hot August day. I turned on the
                    radio and found that the Berlin Wall was being constructed. I found this out
                    from the Soviets and it scared the devil out of me. I did not have my own radio
                    along. I had to rely on the hotel radio and it had a spring loaded mechanism
                    that kept the dial focused on Radio Moscow. But with the use of brute strength I
                    could wheel the dial down to VOA and BBC and essentially get Western reports. I
                    was a child of the cold war. I had been in Germany soon after the beginning of
                    the real cold war. I ran a cold war operation in Vienna. In the Soviet Union I
                    was alone with my wife, 1500 miles away from the nearest Americans and I was
                    scared. I thought the red balloon would go up. I was sure we were going to war
                    and I wondered what I would do there if in fact we did go to war. Well, what
                    happened is that we got on a plane the next day and went on to Tbilisi, the
                    capital of Georgia and set up this exhibit down there.</p>
                <p>Well, I take pride in being in the Soviet Union in that opening era and I take
                    pride in being the director of that first traveling exhibit. We had a very
                    eventful time in Tbilisi. Those six weeks we were down there in the fall of
                    1961, that was the period when Khrushchev was trying to scare Kennedy and was
                    blowing up 20 megaton hydrogen bombs in Novaya Zemlya to the north. One of the
                    innumerable Berlin crises was in full swing and there we were down there hosting
                    tens of thousands of Georgians and Soviet citizens on the floor of this exhibit
                    everyday with all the attendant stress and hubbub and security and all of that
                    that went on with those things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to ask a couple of questions. You got to the Soviet
                        Union approximately a year after Gary Powers was shot down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: I was in the Soviet Union during that trial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But not when he was shot down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: I was there during the trial.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had been to the Soviet Union with the National War
                        College group in 1960 when Tommy Thompson was still ambassador. Of course
                        everything seemed to be going very well then. Just a few weeks after we
                        returned to the United States, Powers was shot down and the curtain dropped
                        even further.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I wondered what the status of the situation was when
                        you got there in 1961. Had it loosened up again considerably after
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Well, it loosened up for one thing because Kennedy came to power and
                    Khrushchev, I think, felt that he could do something with Kennedy. They had
                    their meeting in May in Vienna and it looked as though we could do some things
                    with the Soviets for that initial period. As a matter of fact we did. We had
                    those exchanges which I addressed. We got an academic exchanges program going.
                    We had American students in Leningrad and Moscow and one or two outside of those
                    principal cities. We were beginning to have exchanges of delegations. We had
                    many major performing arts groups on both sides. So we had that starting and it
                    was, of course, endangered in 1962 by the Cuban missile crisis. I was in Moscow
                    during that period and it was very touchy. However, we did not miss a beat in
                    our exchanges programs. Life became a little rough for embassy personnel because
                    of surveillance, although from my point of view, I was able to move around as a
                    representative of the cultural side of the house as freely as I ever did. And I
                    did move around a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were able to travel extensively within the Soviet
                        Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Yes, I was able to travel extensively within the Soviet Union. I was
                    subjected to the same regulations about closed areas, etc., and I had to get
                    permission through the Foreign Office and all that, but I did do that and I
                    traveled a lot. I was out in Siberia in mid 1962 with Ruth Adams, the editor of
                    Ameryka magazine. We took, for me, a memorable trip through Siberia and down
                    through Central Asia and into the Caucasus just prior to the eruption of the
                    Cuban missile crisis. I think that those of us who were engaged in the cultural
                    exchanges programs had an easier time of it in those days than did the people
                    who were in the military and political affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose you traveled by train as you went into the
                        hinterland primarily didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Generally I would take a plane for the long distances. We just didn't
                    have time to travel other ways.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Maybe I can give you a feel for the atmosphere in the embassy at that time. There
                    were two people engaged in USIS work. We had a press operation; we had an
                    academic exchanges program which we negotiated; we had a performing arts
                    exchanges program, we negotiated all the contracts with the Soviets on that and
                    also accompanied the performing arts groups. We had to take care of the American
                    academics and students who came. They were always having their problems and we
                    had to go and negotiate with the Soviets about that. So it was a constant 18
                    hour day right straight through that period. So whenever either one of us took
                    off—and we had to travel of course, we could not just sit in an office in the
                    embassy and handle things—we had to make the trips as compact as possible with
                    very little time for train trips. Although I did take some train trips.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Rocky Staples there at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Rocky Staples was my boss for the first two years I was there.
                    Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He told me that he traveled quite a bit in the Soviet
                        Union by train and he felt that he was able to speak more freely to the
                        Soviet people in the train compartments than he could most anywhere else in
                        the Soviet Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Well, that is right. You can do that in planes too. Actually they were
                    good vehicles for conversations. I never had any problems speaking with
                    Russians, or with Soviets. Occasionally I would note how worried they were. They
                    would look over their shoulders furtively to see who was behind them and all
                    that. That was standard treatment in those days. Rocky was a very hard worker. I
                    don't remember that he took any long trips.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He said he took one trip, the one out to Lake Baikal and
                        beyond on the train and he had a better experience in conversation with the
                        Soviets that time than any other time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: I don't remember that but certainly, if he said it he did it. He was a
                    very good boss. A very hard worker. A very tough negotiator. A positive
                    influence on Soviet-American relations.</p>
                <p>No I had some great experiences in those days. For instance, I accompanied Benny
                    Goodman on his first trip to the Soviet Union in 1962. I was with the New York
                    City Ballet for a few weeks when Balanchine brought his group back in 1962. In
                    1965, by that time I had left the Soviet Union, but I came back with the
                    Cleveland Orchestra under George Szell and spent six weeks touring. Those were
                    marvelous opportunities to meet cultivated Soviets and to get out of the hot
                    house atmosphere of the embassy.</p>

                <p>1964: Assignment To Washington As Head Of Russian And East European Language
                    Broadcasting At VOA</p>
                <p>Well, at any rate, in April 1964 I was called back to the United States to take
                    over the Voice of America broadcasts to the Soviet Union. The Soviets stopped
                    jamming VOA in Russian and seven other languages that spring, so the decision
                    was made to bring me back to take over that broadcasting element in the Voice of
                    America. I spent three years running that program. I took the unit over from a
                    former Soviet general. I was the first American in that unit. Alexander
                    Barmine...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The legendary Barmine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: The legendary Barmine who had been the youngest general in the Red
                    Army during the civil war in the early ''20s, went on to enter Soviet diplomacy.
                    In 1937 he was in Thessaloniki as consul general for the Soviets. He heard that
                    his patron, Marshal Budyenni, had been arrested for treason and knew it would
                    not be long before he would also be arrested. He went upstairs, took some money
                    out of a safe and a gun, went down, got on the train for Paris and left his
                    Soviet experience behind. He eventually came to the United States and was first
                    director of VOA Russian which opened up in 1948. He was director from 1948 until
                    1964 when I took it over.</p>
                <p>Jamming Of VOA Had Stopped; Catherman Changed Personnel And Program Character</p>
                <p>The first thing I did was to hire a dozen Russian-speaking young Americans most
                    of whom came from families of Russian heritage; not all of them, some of them
                    were native Americans from other ethnic origins who had learned good enough
                    Russian to do that sort of broadcasting. We tried to change the nature of our
                    broadcasting to take advantage of fact that we were getting in now with a good
                    clear signal. That was a fine experience for me.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that utilization of American-born people of
                        Russian or Eastern European ancestry gave you a different accent on the

                        broadcasts by emigres who might be downgraded by virtue of defecting from
                        their home country?</hi>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Well I think so, that was a big issue. The emigres of which you speak,
                    of course, were language purists and when we brought these Americans in, they
                    didn't always speak the kind of Russian that the old guard would have liked.
                    However, the cooperation was good. I think that the tone of our broadcast
                    measurably improved. For one thing we did not have to cope with the thought that
                    we were not getting through. We were able to develop a much lighter sort of
                    radio style approach. We didn't have to worry about enunciating all of our words
                    very clearly in case someone could hear through the static. We didn't have to
                    repeat our programs four or five times a day. So the approach was very
                    different. With these young Russian-speaking Americans came a new approach to
                    broadcasting. They were not the sort of fully disciplined readers of script that
                    we had had previously. They came in with their approach to life, some of them
                    were teenagers and they found that they could speak openly in front of the
                    microphone, they didn't need to read. So we changed the whole nature of our
                    broadcasts.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had a lot of ad-libbing then, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: We had a lot of ad-libbing and we began to get audience mail. It was a
                    nice period that didn't last forever. After I left the Voice, of course, jamming
                    recommenced and stayed on until two years ago.</p>

                <p>CATHERMAN: Jamming recommenced after his fall.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: I think there was a time there of a year and a half or so, but I have
                    really forgotten that because by that time I was off doing other things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you felt you really not only turned the broadcasting
                        techniques around but that you perhaps got a much broader audience in the
                        Soviet Union. What kind of letters did you get when you got audience
                        response and how did they get out of the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: I can't tell you that, but they did. Most of the responses were to our
                    music programs. That's always the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Willis Conover and...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Willis was on the English broadcast, he always got lots of response.
                    But we also had our own Russian-language jazz and popular programs. Marie
                    Celiberti, for instance, was one of the great broadcasters in those days. She
                    teamed up with Willis Conover and did a Russian-language version of Willis'
                    broadcast. Most of the fan mail came in response to those music broadcasts. That
                    was obviously an example of Soviets feeling they could get mail out if they
                    stayed in the cultural field because the cultural field was not considered
                    dangerous. Also I assume the censors kept back political content stuff but let
                    the other go through. Anyway we had a good listenership.</p>
                <p>I had the great pleasure of going back with the Cleveland Orchestra while I was
                    running the VOA broadcasts. While sitting in the apartment of the Baltimore
                    Sun's correspondent at midnight one night in Moscow I heard the announcer sign
                    off his program saying that their boss Terry was in Moscow that night and they
                    all wanted to wish me good night and sweet dreams Terry. That was a very
                    pleasant experience.</p>
                <p>So I was in on the opening of the Soviet Union. I was in on two openings. I was
                    in on the opening of the German society after World War II and I was in on the
                    opening of the Soviet society after Stalin. Those are the two things I feel I
                    contributed in this whole period that I spent with USIA.</p>
                <p>1967: National War College</p>
                <p>Then I went to the National War College, also as did you, from '67 to '68, and
                    from there went directly to Israel as PAO. I spent two years there immediately
                    after the Six Day War and from there went back for 3 1/2 years to Berlin; then
                    down to Yugoslavia for 5 1/2 years; then back to Washington where I was Director
                    of the Office of European Affairs for a year and a half. Then I was called down
                    to the Voice of America, by Charlie Wick, as Deputy Director of VOA, replacing
                    Tom Tuch in that job. It was a turbulent period when the Poles reimposed
                    censorship and jamming of the Voice of America began again. From there I went to
                    Paris as PAO for a couple of years and then spent the last five years of my
                    career again in the Federal Republic of Germany as PAO.</p>

                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Israeli society was, of course, very proud of what it had done. It
                    felt that it was, I don't want to give Israeli society a broad brush treatment,
                    but my impression as I look back on that era now is that it had pretty much
                    established itself as impregnable, omnipotent in that part of the world. From my
                    point of view they looked that way. They had won the war, of course there were
                    many Israelis who were grieving at losses of their family members from the Six
                    Day War and I always found that touching. But they felt pretty much that they
                    were able to handle themselves very well in the Middle East. It was my job, and
                    it was not an easy job, to go around and try to convince them in innumerable
                    weekend visits around the country speaking in large and small groups that they
                    would have to figure out a way of making their existence in that part of the
                    country more palatable to the surrounding countries and societies. It was hard
                    work. I loved my stay there and certainly it was one of the most stimulating
                    experiences of my life dealing with the Israelis. I had some touching personal
                    relationships with people with whom I was more at home speaking Russian than
                    English. I learned pretty good Hebrew. I was able to do my business in Hebrew
                    and read the newspapers before I left. There was some military tension, but not
                    a great deal. I will say this, I made quite a contribution, I think, to the
                    positive development of the Israeli-American Fulbright exchanges program. That
                    was one of the high points of my contribution there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you study Hebrew before you went?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: No, I did not. I knew nothing about that country besides reading a few
                    reports when I arrived in Tel Aviv on a hot August afternoon in 1968. I had to
                    start from scratch. However, I don't think I ever worked harder on a language
                    because I felt right from the beginning that I could not simply go around that
                    country and rely on English or Russian or German or whatever else, I had to
                    speak the language to the best of my ability. So the weekends when I was not
                    doing my work was spent on that language.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a tutor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: I had a tutor, a very good tutor. I ended up with a 3+ speaking
                    knowledge and a 2+ reading knowledge. The reading knowledge would allow me to
                    get through the newspaper, but I must say I was never able really to read
                    literature.</p>

                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Well, we had an enormous amount of press work to do because of the
                    intense relationship between the two governments. Due to innumerable visits by
                    congressmen, senators, State Department representatives, the Secretary of State
                    was in and out quite a bit, we had an active relationship with the Israeli and
                    the foreign press. I did a lot of that myself. The other aspect which was
                    important to me was the academic exchanges program. I guess I had three things:
                    the press to handle; the academic exchanges program; and then I had the
                    explanation of American foreign policy as regards Israel, to try to explain it
                    to the Israelis. That was in the period of the so-called Rogers plan, Secretary
                    Rogers. I don't remember the details of it anymore but essentially it asked that
                    the Israelis withdraw from the West Bank, the same things we are asking these
                    days. I had a pretty rough go.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: No, but the Israelis were always very suspicious of our attempts to
                    get them to consider withdrawing, obviously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You never had any trouble selling the American story
                        except as far as the policy was concerned when it impinged on its particular
                        interest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: That is right. They were very friendly and I think from a quality
                    point of view the academic exchanges program was the best one I ever saw. We had
                    really good people going back and forth between the two countries.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Very sophisticated society. A society which seemed to me at any rate
                    to know what it wanted to do and how to do it. Of course the development of the
                    country itself, the infrastructure and everything, was staggering for me. I was

                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Yes, that's right. In those days we had no program in East Germany,
                    but we did have RIAS, Radio In American Sector, and that was part of my
                    portfolio. I was called the senior deputy PAO, the country PAO was located in
                    Bonn and I was his senior deputy because of the importance then of Berlin to the
                    effort.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your primary concerns in Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: We had the four power talks which led to the Berlin Agreement and they
                    took up about a year and a half of my time there. Once again I spent most of my
                    time engaged in briefing, or trying to convince, the Western press about our
                    aims in those talks. I represented the American negotiator, Ambassador Kenneth
                    Rush. It was again lots of press work. I did not have as much cultural work then
                    as I had had when I was in Israel or previously in the Soviet Union. It was
                    pretty much hardline political work.</p>
                <p>After the conclusion of the Berlin Agreement we began to go to the East Germans
                    and negotiate what eventually was the establishment of diplomatic relations with
                    East Germany. My job was to talk with the East Germans about their treatment of
                    the Western, specifically American, press. In other words I had to defend the
                    First Amendment in a communist country. I would go over from West Berlin to East
                    Berlin and talk with those people and try to get their agreement to a relatively
                    relaxed arrangement for American newspapers to cover Eastern Germany. I didn't
                    succeed very well, but at least the attempt was made and was made persistently.
                    So for the last six months of my stay there I did that, not exclusively, but a
                    preponderant part of my job was precisely that, dealing with the East
                    Germans.Virulent Anti-Americanism Especially From Students In This Era</p>

                        great deal to do with the things that were transpiring there at that time.

                        others of that ilk?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Let me put it this way. When I arrived in Berlin in November, 1970,
                    the Amerika House, our cultural center in downtown Berlin, did not have one
                    window left. Every window had been shattered. This was a tremendous cultural
                    shock for me. I had left Germany in 1955 with the feeling that we, the
                    Americans, had helped the Germans reestablish a viable society; we integrated
                    them into the Western community; we got them into our security apparatus; they
                    were developing a good firm democracy. I came back in 1970, fifteen years later,
                    to find the students on the streets on rampages against the Americans.
                    Essentially at that period because of the Cambodian campaign. The run up had, of
                    course, been Vietnam earlier. So I had that atmosphere in Berlin. Berlin was a
                    specific place anyway—a special place in Germany because young men who did not
                    want to be drafted came to Berlin where there was no draft. There could not be a
                    draft because it was still under occupation law—Four Power Occupation Law. So we
                    got a lot of people up there, of course, who were against the military anyway
                    and who certainly were against us. So we lived through many mass demonstrations.
                    Some of them reasonably threatening, although to my knowledge, none of us ever
                    got hurt, it looked as if we might. It was tough dealing with the Berlin
                    students from the Free University, the university that we had been instrumental
                    in founding and had put millions of dollars into in the late ''40s. The Free
                    University and the Technical University turned into hotbeds of student
                    disenchantment with the United States. As a matter of fact, the Lutheran student
                    home where Red Rudy Duschke lived in Berlin was right behind my private house in
                    Berlin. I use to watch the students storm out of there and jump into their VWs
                    with their red banners flying on the way to these demonstrations with some
                    amusement. For one thing they had cars and I never thought of the workers
                    movement in communist terms as going to demonstrations in their own cars. But,
                    secondly, there they were right behind me, all around me, as a matter of fact. I
                    lived right in the area where the Free University was located and I never once
                    had an ugly, unpleasant encounter with those students on a personal basis. I had
                    many of them when I tried to explain American foreign policy in meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask you to what extent did you and others
                        in the staff attempt to communicate with the students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: We communicated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you get anywhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>CATHERMAN: We got nowhere at all. They were very emotional and reason was not the
                    way to handle them. As a matter of fact, I don't see any way we could have
                    handled them. I remember getting many, many turndowns. I would volunteer to come
                    over to speak to groups and they would send notes back saying we don't deal with
                    the CIA and things like that. So it was a charged political atmosphere as far as
                    the students were concerned. But the city administration, of course, was SPD,
                    firmly pro-western, Klaus Schutz was the governing mayor, and we had very good
                    relations with them. We had excellent relations with the cultural establishment,
                    the administrations of the universities and so on. So it was bifurcated, really.
                    As long as we did not get entangled in anti-American mass student demonstrations
                    we could live a pretty comfortable and satisfying life in Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This prompts a couple of questions. Was there any segment
                        of the student population that was not taken up almost completely in this
                        radicalization? And the other question is: I have heard it said that the
                        students gained so much power, particularly in the Free University that they
                        practically dictated the appointment of professors and even administration
                        and practically ruined the value of the Free University. I would like to get
                        your view point on both of those questions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Frankly I don't have readily in my mind the number of students who
                    were engaged in this political activism. It was a minority, it was not the
                    majority by any means. Although they could turn out big demonstrations. They
                    could turn out 30 to 50,000 with no problem at all. They were a minority. You
                    are absolutely right, the self-administration that they perpetrated on the
                    universities, and not only the Free University in Berlin, were dangerous. The
                    open university simply became a gathering place for masses of young people, many
                    of whom had indifferent academic interests but it seemed to be the place to be
                    for many for 7 or 8 years. Some of them were very serious about their studies
                    and others were not. They did have an enormous influence on the way German
                    universities were governed and administered. You are right that the rectors and
                    later on the presidents of the universities lost their power to control what was
                    going on in the universities. They had a collegial system where the cleaning
                    personnel had as much of a voice as did the professors in appointments in
                    faculties. And of course the students had a big role in these appointments too.
                    So the tendency was, obviously, to bring in professors who were radical, and who
                    were not too exacting in their standards. Saying that, there were faculty who
                    remained rock solid throughout all this. The physical sciences remained
                    typically German in their disciplined approach, and although the self-governing
                    apparatus applied to them too they managed to keep their professorial
                    appointments pretty much on an academic basis. The social scientists and
                    humanities were the ones that were really rent by all this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any opportunity to talk to the larger segment of
                        the student population which was not involved in this radicalization or was
                        that pretty much foreclosed to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>CATHERMAN: It was not foreclosed, nothing was foreclosed, it was an open society.
                    They were not very interested. The engineers had their own things that they
                    wanted to do so I didn't find much enthusiasm for hearing about why Americans
                    should be in Vietnam or Cambodia. They were really not interested in hearing
                    from me about why we had Watergate and those things. Those were the events that
                    were on everybody's mind, it seemed to be everybody's mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the standpoint of other than physical destruction,
                        what did this mean to the America House and its attendance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Well, actually we had reasonably good attendance during those days.
                    More for cultural events than the political events. The popularity of the
                    Americans as purveyors of political information in Germany had already waned
                    considerably. We were not looked upon as a creditable political source. But the
                    culture still went on unabated, and it still does today. The American cultural
                    offerings in Germany are as popular now as they were in the early ''50s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I will get to this a little later when you get to your
                        last tour over there, but do you think that this loss of credibility, as far
                        as America being a source of political sophistication and interest, has
                        remained in Germany? Have we pretty well lost it permanently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: That is the big question. I don't really feel that I can give a
                    creditable answer to that. My feeling is that we lost a lot because of Vietnam.
                    We lost a lot because of Watergate. Before those two phenomena, the United
                    States was considered more or less the paragon in West Germany. Of course, there
                    had been American brutality in World War II and we carpet bombed cities (and the
                    argument was raised whether that was necessary or not) but essentially we were
                    the paragon. We came in there with our democratic ideas. After the
                    de-nazification period people were free to go where they pleased. The economy
                    flourished, etc. And then along came those events. They were followed by the
                    great debates about missiles. The answer to the SS-20s and the debate about the
                    emplacement of the Pershings on German soil and cruise missiles with atomic
                    warheads, etc. That brought out all of these young people who had been nurtured
                    on the anti-Americanism of Vietnam and Watergate onto the streets with the
                    question of why was America doing this to us. We want to be left out of this, we
                    have other things we want to do. Those were the three big phenomena that tipped
                    a lot of Germans thinking about the United States away from that euphoria that
                    we had in the immediate post-war World War II era; during the high point of the
                    cold war when we were the defender of liberty and all of that and rescued Berlin
                    from Stalin.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which probably accounts for the opinion recently that some
                        75-80% of the Germans disapprove of the US action in the Gulf.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Well, yes. But of course a lot of it stems from our immediate post-war
                    approach to the Germans. They lost a war and shouldn't be running around the
                    world creating all that trouble. There is a lot to be said there. I want to
                    qualify what I said about German attitudes about the United States. Invariably
                    when Germans come into physical contact with American society they have a
                    positive impression. They get a very positive impression. That applies today as
                    well as previously. If a German comes to this country as a tourist or as a
                    participant in one of our exchanges programs he comes back to Germany with a
                    positive impression. It practically never fails, although it has in a couple of
                    instances. It failed with Oskar La Fontaine; that didn't work with him, although
                    he certainly is not an enemy of the United States. He is sort of sour about what
                    he saw here. But in most cases that is not true. So I cannot as an individual
                    give you a direct answer to your question. It is the dilemma as far as German
                    attitudes about Americans are concerned.</p>
                <p>May, 1974: Country Public Affairs Officer, Yugoslavia</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lets go on to...Where did you go from Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: While I was in Berlin I was assigned as PAO to Yugoslavia and Dottie
                    and I had the great privilege of studying Serbo-Croatian in Berlin. The Minister
                    in Berlin, Dave Klein, found an apartment for us to use for the four months that
                    we studied Serbo-Croatian and we had a very good course at Berlitz in Berlin. In
                    May, 1974 we went to Yugoslavia able to conduct our affairs in Serbo-Croatian
                    and it was really a nice experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your immediate predecessor there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Pic Littell. Pic Littell was another guy I followed around.</p>
                <p>We spent 5 1/2 years there. The Yugoslav experience was different than any other
                    one I had in that we were in a society overwhelmingly pro-American and
                    overwhelmingly open to people who were interested in the arts and intellectual
                    activities. Dottie's an artist and I was interested in the performing arts as
                    well as the creative arts. Within the matter of a few weeks we established
                    life-long friendships with the best writers, the artists, the poets and some of
                    the journalists. It was not as interesting for me to be with the journalists who
                    were under a great deal of pressure, as it was with the creative arts, the
                    performing artists. It was a very positive experience.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the essential parts of your program while you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: We had five branch offices in Yugoslavia. Our Embassy was located in
                    Belgrade, but we also had information and cultural centers, and Americans
                    running them, in the five provincial capitals. So we ran a full-blown USIS
                    program across the board. There was a quite large academic exchanges program. We
                    had full access to the media, so we had an information program. Although the
                    government didn't by any means agree with what we said, we had access to the
                    press. We had unparalleled personal contact opportunities and I think that was
                    my big contribution. I simply went with the writers and the creative
                    intellectuals of that country for 5 1/2 years and that was the big thing I
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice any intensity in the ethnic differences
                        within the country which has now flared into unfortunately civil war
                        proportions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: They were always there. I didn't notice that it was intensified with
                    the single exception of the Kosovo. The Albanians in the Kosovo area were
                    becoming a bigger problem and there were disturbances down there toward the end
                    of my tour. In 1979 there were some killings down there. The Yugoslav army moved
                    in. Things were degrading there, no doubt about it. As far as Croatia and
                    Slovenia were concerned the relations were not good but I did not feel they were
                    degrading while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have the intense blow-ups that are now taking

                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: No, because Tito was still alive. You know the old story about
                    Yugoslavia being a country of five nationalities, four languages, three
                    religions, two alphabets, and one Yugoslav. And that was Tito.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the Catholic Church treated in Yugoslavia? Was it
                        pretty free to operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Croatia was Roman Catholic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, I know they were Roman Catholic, but there was a lot
                        of Muslim influence in the country, too.</hi>

                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>CATHERMAN: The Muslim influence was essentially in the Kosovo area and in
                    Bosnia—its capital is Sarajevo. Yeah, you had Muslims down there. Actually
                    Muslims were able to practice their religion throughout the country. The Roman
                    Catholic Church was most active in the north—Slovenia and Croatia. It was
                    tolerated in Serbia, but the Serbian Orthodox Church was essentially the church
                    of choice among the Christians in Serbia. And that applied also to Montenegro
                    and Macedonia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is not necessarily connected with your professional

                </p>
                <p>Will Yugoslavia Fly Apart?</p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: I think it will, yeah. The Serbs will try to pull the Slovenians back
                    and will probably succeed applying a lot of force. The Yugoslav army is
                    officered essentially by Serbs and there is going to be some violence. I'm not
                    clairvoyant, I don't know how this will spin out. The Slovenians obviously want
                    to become part of Western Europe. They want to get away from the albatross
                    around their neck, the rest of Yugoslavia, since they contribute their lion
                    share of the economic sustenance for Yugoslavia as such. So I think it is going
                    to be very difficult.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your are right, I am afraid that country is going to fly

                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Yeah. We have one major difference now and that is the cold war is
                    over and the Soviet threat is not as powerful as it used to be. So if it does
                    fly apart, from our point of view, it probably would not mean the end of the
                    world. It would have been extremely dangerous for us, the Americans, back in the
                    ''60s and ''70s when I was there and the Soviets were still considered the
                    enemy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One final question before we leave Yugoslavia. At the time
                        that I was at the War College we visited Yugoslavia as well as the Soviet
                        Union. At that time I found that the army was probably the most vocal in
                        their condemnation of, and contempt for the Soviet government. Was that
                        universally true, did you find any of that when you were there? Much more so
                        than the civilian population who tended to keep their feelings more quiet in
                        that respect.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>CATHERMAN: That is a tough question. The Yugoslavs, including the army, were very
                    careful while I was there not to irritate the Soviets overly. As long as the
                    Soviets in Yugoslavia behaved, the Yugoslavs would rather have tolerated them
                    and not create or allow tension to develop. I didn't have all that much
                    experience with the army, but I did meet a lot of officers. Certainly from the
                    civilian component the attempt was not to play up the tensions between the
                    Soviets and the Yugoslavs. The tensions were certainly there, but we tended to
                    hear of them from intelligence sources rather than from on-the-street
                    conversations. Of course, we knew what the Soviets were trying to do. They were
                    certainly, I would say, brutal in their treatment of the Yugoslavs. They were
                    doing what they could to subvert the economy and the society and I think in some
                    respects they were somewhat successful.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose the reason why the military were as outspoken as
                        they were was because we were the War College group and they didn't
                        necessarily distinguish between those of us who were officers in the
                        military and those of us who were civilians. They thought they were dealing
                        with essentially an American military oriented group, and I suppose that was
                        the reason they were more vocal.</hi>

                <p>CATHERMAN: You were there in an earlier and much tougher time, during the cold

                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Right, exactly. That was a tough period. It was a period when the
                    Yugoslavs had not firmly established that they had pulled away from the Soviet
                    Union. They were still working on it. By the mid ''70s, when I went there, that
                    was pretty well established. Not that the Soviets were not trying to subvert the
                    Yugoslavs, but they did not pose the massive threat that they had posed when you
                    were there in 1960.</p>

                <p>I remember in an anecdotal way taking Mr. Wick on his first trip abroad as

                    Director</p>
                <p>Toward the end of that first year and a half in Washington, the Poles began their
                    clamp down. USIA responded, as did the US Government, of course, with
                    approbation, and the Poles began jamming the Voice and I was sent down to the
                    Voice of America as Deputy Director in a period when the Voice was once again
                    beginning to occupy center stage because in that crisis people were looking to
                    the Voice as a source of information, and as a source of broadcasting official
                    commentaries on world affairs. So it was exciting.</p>
                <p>The Voice is always in a turmoil. It is right now. We are in another crisis
                    here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, a little later I would like to get your thoughts on
                        the most recent attempt on the part of the Agency to pull the Voice's
                        personnel and their budgeting back into the central office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Yes, I was, of course, in the Voice of America when Mr. Wick gave VOA
                    autonomy over the conduct of its personnel and administrative offices. And now I
                    am back at the Voice, working as a retiree, when the opposite move is being
                    made. So I have seen it go both ways. If I may comment right now on that, I
                    think Mr. Wick was very wise to do what he did because he won the loyalty of the
                    directors of VOA in giving VOA some autonomy in conducting its personnel
                    affairs. USIA had never done a very good job of administering VOA. For one thing
                    USIA has other interests and VOA has only one and that is broadcasting. So, USIA
                    tended to apply different criteria in its hiring policies than VOA wanted to
                    apply. VOA needed broadcasters. USIA needed foreign service officers, writers, a
                    variety of people, cultural affairs specialists, etc. and did not concentrate
                    adequately on getting broadcasters for VOA. So I think that was a very wise move
                    on Mr. Wick's part. In return he had very good relations with the directors of
                    VOA. In a way I thought they felt they were beholden to him for that move.
                    Another thing that Mr. Wick did in that period when I was here was commence an
                    enormous rebuilding of the VOA broadcasting infrastructure. There was a time
                    when people were talking in terms of putting upwards of a billion dollars alone
                    in VOA construction. That has since eroded.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was pretty much brought up sharp about four or five

                <p>Right Wing Ideologues Brought Into Voice Cause Dissension</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>CATHERMAN: But those were heady days down here. They were ideologically fraught.
                    I came down here at the same time that some very extremely right wing ideologues
                    also arrived in the Voice of America. The editorials they tried to write I
                    thought were so full of anti-Soviet invective that they did not properly
                    represent official American attitude towards the Soviet Union, nor were they
                    proper content for VOA broadcasts. I had quite a struggle on that one. As a
                    matter of fact, I think eventually I was eased out of the Voice because of my
                    obstreperousness in protecting the VOA news service from that kind of influence
                    and in trying to temper the political content.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your observation of the feeling of the rank and
                        file of the VOA personnel at that time? Were they also disturbed by this
                        heavy orientation towards the extreme right wing.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Well, they were outraged. That is an element of VOA was outraged.
                    Another element of VOA was outraged that we were not harder. That is endemic to
                    VOA. VOA has elements that will be outraged at whatever happens. It is a huge
                    amorphous group of people. There are all kinds of elements down here as there
                    must be because we are an international broadcaster. We have all these language
                    services and we also have a determined core of American journalists who consider
                    themselves journalists and are going to defend the First Amendment, as any right
                    thinking journalist would do. All kinds of people down here encompassing the
                    political spectrum.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you still have bad feeling between the English language
                        broadcasts and the other language services?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still as tough as it ever was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: I think that that sort of back biting here in the Voice has subsided
                    somewhat, but it has not disappeared. It is not as rampant as it seemed to me it
                    was when I was here 10 years ago. I think part of that is the soft touch of the
                    administration of the Voice right now. The people who are running the Voice are
                    very attuned to the various tensions here and pay attention to them, and don't
                    fan the flames. Which has been done in the past.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I headed, at the request of then Director Jim Keogh, a
                        study group that came down here in '74 and it was rampant at that time. The
                        battle of the English language broadcasting which felt it was riding high
                        was the principal element of the Voice and the opposition, the language
                        services which was terribly intense at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>CATHERMAN: This came to the fore again, of course, just recently when Mr. Gelb
                    came over here and insisted on appearing before the employees of VOA together
                    with Mr. Carlson. In the process it seemed to me at any rate, some sores in VOA
                    were reopened. It is not merely that VOA has an intense relationship with the
                    mother agency, but it also has all of these things going on within VOA. All of
                    those lesions were opened again. So the tension is bigger than it was, let's say
                    four or five weeks ago. But it still is not as big as it was in those days when
                    the Poles were jamming and a new administration was trying to figure out what to
                    do with the VOA and there were all those political uncertainties. We do not have
                    those political uncertainties here in the Voice right now. We know where we
                    stand and we know how to deal with it.</p>
                <p>1985: Return To Germany As PAO/Director Of USIS</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lets go on. What were your observations during your last
                        tour? How do you think the German-American relationship had progressed by
                        that time and where were we from your stand point as USIS head at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: When I came back to Germany in 1985, I had two years in France before
                    coming to Germany. I was in Paris from '83-'85. That was quite an experience
                    too. I arrived in Germany at the time the debate about short range nuclear
                    weapons was at its height. It was an anti-American debate. One can characterize
                    it differently, but I don't. I characterize it as a debate against the placement
                    of American Pershing II and cruise missiles on German soil. They just didn't
                    want us. We could go through the whole business that the Soviets had SS-20s
                    capable of destroying Germany and all of that, but it made no dent on these
                    young people who did not want on West German soil atomic weaponry capable of
                    striking the Soviet Union. That was the atmosphere I encountered when I came
                    back to Germany for my final tour. The Ambassador was Rick Burt, a young, I
                    think about 40 at that time, intellectual, a strategic arms expert who had
                    things that he wanted to tell the Germans. He had been a New York Times
                    correspondent and knew exactly what the media were doing. He wanted in on that.
                    So I found that USIS on the press side, the information side, was sucked
                    completely into this debate. Our job was to support the Ambassador, to write his
                    speeches, to get the widest possible coverage of those speeches, to get him into
                    the right fora, and to keep moving on the short range nuclear weaponry—to keep
                    it going. We worked very hard on it. I was in on it. I had to learn a hell of a
                    lot, some of which I had either forgotten or never known, about that form of
                    weaponry. I had to encounter tens of thousands of mostly young people around the
                    country who were dead set against that.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>However, at the same time we had several other things going which functioned
                    reasonably well. The heyday of the Amerika Haus was past. It was past 20 years
                    previously. We still, however, did have those installations and they were still
                    open, lending books, having conferences and seminars and American speakers
                    talking about subjects, including nuclear missilery and so on. So there was a
                    program going to which the Germans paid attention. I never had an unpleasant
                    personal encounter of my own during those five years I spent in the concluding
                    time of my career with the Germans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the audience for the programs of this nature that
                        were carried out by the Amerika Ha�ser?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: They tried to get young people, but youth didn't really have much time
                    for it. It was professional people, mature people, although I don't want to sell
                    the attempts to get young people engaged short. Because there were young people
                    there. I think it was a pretty good mix. It was not big, but there were people
                    who were willing to talk with Americans, and in that respect I noticed a
                    difference from that period of my intense combat in Berlin. I had no problem
                    ever talking with people. I remember one memorable evening when Rick Burt
                    invited the entire Green representation from the Bundestag to his house for
                    dinner. Lo and behold they came. I don't think anybody turned that invitation
                    down. We had a great evening with those people. Although I don't want to sell
                    the fervor of that anti-short range nuclear weaponry debate short, we were able
                    to do business. We had a fine leaders program, the international visitors
                    program, the biggest in the world. We had a wonderful academic exchanges
                    program; I think that was the best work I did, with those academics. Charlie
                    Wick came along and installed a television station at RIAS in Berlin and I
                    worked on that tirelessly, still am working on it.</p>
                <p>The Interest In And Devotion To USA-German Relations Has Waned Among USIA
                    Officers Today</p>
                <p>So I think USIS functioned as well as it could given a couple of factors. The
                    people who work for USIS today are not the same type of people who were working
                    for USIS in the 1950s. You don't have those really prominent scholars, people
                    engaged in the women's movement, who came into the USIS foreign service. Why
                    should they? We don't have that kind of mission anymore. So, we are dealing with
                    a foreign service officer who spent some time in Germany, but he or she also
                    spends a lot of time in the Third World or other countries, and who does not
                    have that intense loyalty to the German-American relationship, let's say that I
                    do. I spent a total of 12 years in that country.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>With the result that as the fruits of my initial work with the Germans began to
                    ripen, as the German nation unified, I felt in many respects that my work had
                    borne some fruit. That we had in the Germans a democratic society, we were
                    working on that. We now have a unified Germany which was one of our goals. A
                    unified, democratic Germany, a prosperous Germany. I can look back to a speech
                    that Jimmy Byrnes delivered in September 1946, four years before I came to
                    Germany but which set, even in those early days after World War II, the tone for
                    American attitudes towards Germany. He concluded that speech by saying the
                    American people want a prosperous, unified, democratic people and we will help
                    you achieve that. In December 1989, Jim Baker in Berlin said that he was proud
                    to be a representative of the Americans who had stood by the Germans as they
                    democratized and united. I can only echo both of those statements and they more
                    or less encompass my life in the USIA foreign service.</p>

                    Unification</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This may not be a fair question, but what do you think the
                        unification of Germany is going to do to that feeling, inasmuch as the East
                        Germans now are having their own difficulties with the West Germans and vice
                        versa, coming from a completely different 40 years of political and economic
                        background? They have very little, I would guess, feeling of what the
                        Americans did to democratize the country after World War II. Do you think it
                        is going to dilute whatever feeling is left among the Germans of favoritism
                        towards the US?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: I would like to deflect that question, if I could. I don't think, for
                    me at any rate, that that is a germane question. The way I look at the Germans
                    is that those differences between East and West will be taken care of very
                    quickly with generous application of what the German characterize—discipline,
                    working together. The East German attitudes towards the United States that I was
                    able to observe before I returned home were not at all negative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wouldn't think so much negative as perhaps just
                        apathetic.</hi>

                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Or uninformed. But we are going to make up for that. Chancellor Kohl
                    wants to emphasize East Germany in our exchanges program. He is very concerned
                    that East Germans have a good picture of the United States as quickly as they
                    can get it. And I think we will cooperate with him in doing that. He put some
                    German money on the line to take care of that. I don't look upon that as a big
                    problem. What I see, however, is a burgeoning democratic power, Germany, sitting
                    in the middle of Europe. I would be foolish not to say that we are going to have
                    enough problems with that democratic Germany as it evolves and takes its place
                    as the most powerful country in Europe, and I mean Europe East and West. I guess
                    the final proof will be how Germans and Americans interrelate as the Germans
                    look upon us completely as equals. We will see whether these decades that we
                    stayed with the Germans pay off for us. I am an optimist about that. I think we
                    will get along with them reasonably well, but there is not going to be any free
                    lunch. By no means.</p>

                        mitigated somewhat and we may not see the built in antipathy that existed
                        for a time with the youth as they were growing up, or do you anticipate any
                        difficulty in reference to our German relationships as a result of

                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: No I don't see any great difficulty although if we keep getting into
                    wars that the young Germans don't like, they are certainly going to go to the
                    street, and they are in the streets right now and they will be tomorrow which is
                    a big demonstration day, the 26th of January—a big day of anti-war and
                    anti-American demonstrations in Germany. But the relationship between the two
                    governments is not too adversely affected by those demonstrations. The
                    relationship between the two governments will be put under stress as the Germans
                    reassume what they feel is their rightful posture in Eastern Europe and as they
                    intensify their relationship with the Soviet Union at a time when, perhaps, we
                    can not for a variety of reasons. Ideological as well as economic.</p>

                        will be absorbed. It will be absorbed in that part of the world and not in
                        the Persian Gulf. That is a fact of life I think.</hi>

                    Pro-American</p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: Well, I was surprised at the pro-Americanism that I found among the
                    French. I had been led to believe that the French were cynical about the
                    Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think they were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: And I came there ill prepared. Next to Israel France was the country I
                    was least prepared to cope with on arrival. I was sent to Paris because the
                    deputy to Charlie Wick, Gil Robinson, wanted me out of the Voice. I was creating
                    trouble for him down here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was soon out of the Agency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: He was soon out of the Agency but he wasn't out of the Agency then. He
                    wanted to get me out of there but he knew he had to handle it in a way that I
                    would not create great trouble. He gave me a major PAO-ship, which I had trouble
                    refusing and I went, but I was not prepared. I spent several months learning
                    French, but by that time my hearing was going and I really had some problems
                    with the language, although I had a conversational ability and I used French. I
                    was not prepared for the enthusiastic reception on the part of the French and
                    that started from the day I arrived and was still going on when I left France to
                    go to Bonn.</p>
                <p>I never felt as confident in my French as I did in Russian, Serbo-Croatian or
                    German so that tempered the way I went about handling my affairs there. But the
                    response from the French to me and to Americans was overwhelmingly positive. It
                    was an overwhelmingly positive era in French-American relations. I arrived just
                    in time for some celebrations of the 200 anniversary of the conclusion of our
                    Revolutionary War. The town was full of Americans in colonial clothing and the
                    French loved that sort of pageantry. We had some wonderful ceremonies and
                    dinners at Versailles. They went on all night. I was overwhelmed with all of
                    this. I had a good time with the French and I think, again, my best contribution
                    was in bringing some better order into the academic exchanges program.
                    Continuing the very fruitful university relationships that were in effect all
                    over the country. And dealing with political affairs, mostly again centering
                    around nuclear weaponry. But I will admit, that from my professional point of
                    view, those two years in France were the least satisfying because I had never
                    dealt with a romance language. My languages had been Germanic with the exception
                    of Hebrew or Slavic. It just took too much of my time trying to cope with the
                    language. That is a lesson I hope USIA has learned, not to send senior officers
                    who are not qualified in a language to major posts. It happened with me and it
                    caused a great deal of stress for me, more than I want to talk about.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you undoubtedly know there was a lot of feeling over
                        many years that the Western European program had been inbred and that
                        officers had tended to make a career out of it and resisted being anywhere
                        else except Western Europe. No where was this more evident than the case of
                        the French program. I think some of it was justified. The people who were in
                        USIS almost invariably tended to look down upon anyone who came out there to
                        participate in the USIS program if they were not Francophiles and if they
                        were not French language specialists. An attempt was made to clear out that
                        kind of ingrained French immersion. By the time you got there had that been
                        fairly well adjusted or was there still a good deal of that attitude on the
                        part of the American staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: I don't remember that there was any of that. Most of the Americans, if
                    not all of them, had come from African posts where they had learned that version
                    of French and with one or two exceptions they were all having their own little
                    problems. They were better off in the language than I was, but they were by no
                    means perfect. There were one or two people who spoke perfect, bilingual French.
                    But out of 20 Americans their linguistic abilities were not top class, although
                    they did a good job, we had a good staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think that was a result of a concentrated effort
                        to move people out of the French program and bring in people with other
                        viewpoints and experiences.</hi>

                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>CATHERMAN: That is important too. You raise, in certain aspects, an ideological
                    question. It might not be a bad time to address this. This sort of back biting
                    that goes on in USIA, even more so than in the State Department, about
                    assignments to Western Europe or to Europe as a whole versus all those posts in
                    the Third World or other continents. My approach is something like this. We
                    obviously have to serve all posts and that involves also not working in Western
                    Europe. There is a danger, however, that USIA feels that it cannot measure up to
                    mounting full-blown information and cultural efforts in Western Europe. There is
                    a danger that USIA officers will go for the quick fix that they can get in a
                    Third World country where their success is assured. I rebel against that. I
                    think it is every bit as important that the United States Government have
                    fruitful, cultural and information relationships with the West Europeans as it
                    is with Africans, or any other representatives of the Third World. It requires a
                    different type of approach. You obviously are not going to go into Western
                    Europe with an assured success. On the other hand, the chances that you will get
                    killed probably are less. But we should not neglect, let's say, the Germans
                    because we are dealing with a democratic society. We should not neglect the
                    Germans. The Germans are going to pose great problems for the Americans in the
                    future. If we can keep Germans coming our way, paying attention to what we
                    Americans are thinking and doing, we are going to be able to deal with the
                    Germans much better than if we decide that since they are now democratized and
                    united we do not have to deal with them. We must deal with them. We must keep
                    showing them what we have on our minds and what we are doing. We must keep using
                    the resources that have been successful with the Germans in the past, in the
                    future. And that applies to the other West Europeans also. We cannot take them
                    for granted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you are entirely right. Congress has a lot to do
                        with this too. When I was still active in trying to justify our programs and
                        resources on the Hill, a majority of Congress had come to the conclusion
                        that we had done our job in Western Europe. They are all our friends now so
                        why are we wasting money on the European programs, lets get it on elsewhere.
                        There was, I think, particularly in the Kennedy years, a feeling on the part
                        of some people in USIA, Tom Sorensen and one of two others, who felt that
                        Europe ought to be decimated and haul all those stuffed shirts out of there
                        and put them in other countries where it was perhaps more difficult and see
                        whether they could work in an environment which was different from Western
                        Europe. Therefore about the time I was getting ready to leave the Agency,
                        there was a wholesale cutting back in the European program. I think a lot of
                        that was the feeling that had come over from the Sorensen days and that
                        resulted in a lot of changes in the personnel in Western Europe.I couldn't
                        agree with you more and I don't know what Congress feels now. I haven't had
                        any contact with them. What do you think?</hi>

                <p>Before we conclude do you have any other general comments you would like to make,
                    any reminisces or observations on your career that you would like to express?
                    Where do you think the USIA is going in light of the current argument that
                    exists to the effect that we should be broken up and assigned to different
                    jurisdictions of the US Government?</p>
                <p>Final Observations About Role And Value Of Public Diplomacy And Of USIA As An
                    Entity</p>
                <p>CATHERMAN: I think the function of public diplomacy (maybe we could use better
                    terminology, but public diplomacy is what we are using right now) is very
                    important and is fast becoming the most important function of diplomacy. When I
                    think of the changes that have taken place in the ambassadors' approach to the
                    media since I have been in this business it is astonishing. I probably spent as
                    much time with Ambassador Walters in Germany over that last year of my career as
                    did anybody in the Embassy. Essentially working with him to put in a public
                    affairs context what he wanted to say to Germans above and beyond what he said
                    to the Chancellor or the Foreign Minister. The same thing applied even more so
                    with Rick Burt who is a media person. He spent the majority of his time dealing
                    with the media. So the function has become increasingly important. I am not a
                    big fan of USIA as an entity. I can see VOA as an entity. I am not totally
                    convinced that having a separate arm of American diplomacy for the public aspect
                    separate from the rest of diplomacy is the way to go at it. On the other hand, I
                    don't believe that so firmly that I am going to do battle about it. I just have
                    my doubts that USIA is very important whereas the function is crucial. We cannot
                    exist in the diplomatic life of the United States without dealing with the media
                    in a big way any more. We can not do that. That involves the Ambassador and
                    everyone else in the Embassy who is dealing with the public, and that is
                    practically everybody. So the function is very important. My impression about
                    USIA is that it doesn't play a very big role in that. The organization does not,
                    people in it do. The people in it are vital. But I don't see the organization
                    playing a big role. The result is we get a succession of discontented directors
                    to come in with a lot of energy and end up thoroughly frustrated and frankly
                    tend to create problems for the professionals who have to conduct this public
                    diplomacy. So I am not thoroughly convinced of that. But I am thoroughly
                    convinced that public diplomacy is as important, if not more important, than
                    anything else that embassies do or this government does.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just one comment. The trouble is that if we found
                        Presidents more concerned with putting people in as head of USIA who know
                        and will do something about public diplomacy or something more about media
                        treatment we probably wouldn't have the difficulties we have had. I think
                        that is largely the problem. I think you are right also that somehow or
                        other USIA doesn't quite have the standing it ought to have. Whether a
                        return to the State Department is the answer, I don't know. I grew up in the
                        program in the days when being in the State Department was suffocating. You
                        often just simply couldn't do anything and the ambassadors abroad wouldn't
                        let you do anything. I know it has all changed now.</hi>
