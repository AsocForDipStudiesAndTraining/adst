                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 20th of March 2004, this is an interview with
                        James F. Mack. This is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training and I am Charles Stewart Kennedy. You go by
                        Jim?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh Right! Well to begin with when and where were you
                        born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well I was born in 1941 in Norwalk, Connecticut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell me a little about your father's side of the
                        family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well, my father actually was born in Washington, DC and he graduated from a
                    High School in Washington and went off to Cornell to study Mechanical
                    Engineering. He graduated in 1929, not a good year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not a good year!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Not a good year. He graduated 3 months before the stock market crash of
                    1929 and the onset of the Great Depression. He worked a year as an engineer in a
                    silk mill in Connecticut. Then, like all the other newly hired, he was first
                    fired. So, he went back to Washington, lived with his parents and went to law
                    school at night at George Washington University and worked in a law office by
                    day. He became a patent lawyer and moved back up to Norwalk, Connecticut, where
                    he went into practice, met my mother who was a “Yankee”, and got married in
                    1937. My sister was born in 1940 and I in 1941. Shortly after I was born, my
                    family moved to Rye, New York, where I grew up.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was life like for you in Rye? What was Rye like for
                        you in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: It was a good place to grow up. Rye is a small town in Westchester County
                    on Long Island Sound about 25 miles from Times Square. You can see the New York
                    skyline. While Rye is close to New York, it has a small town atmosphere, good
                    public schools, a public golf course, a public marina, and a public beach,
                    nature preserves etc. So it remains a very nice place to grow up, a really, safe
                    environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The schools, you went through the public school
                        system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I went through the 10th grade in the public school system. Then I went away
                    to boarding school for Williston Academy in East Hampton, Massachusetts for 11th
                    and 12th grades.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lets stick to the Rye thing. What sort of thing in
                        elementary school interested you, reading, extra-curriculum things,
                        particular studies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Elementary goes way back. Of course, I was a kid, so I liked sports,
                    especially football.. I played the tuba in the school band. I was always
                    interested in geography and those kinds of things. By 5th and 6th grade I was
                    interested in international affairs.</p>
                <p>I can't remember how young I was, but I still remember watching a bright young
                    political science professor from Colombia or NYU who appeared frequently on
                    television talking about the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. His name was
                    Zbigniew Brzezinski. So, I always had this kind of fascination with
                    international affairs issues as a kid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you got to High School were you able to do
                        anything with International Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Not really. I was a pretty normal kid. I played in the band then
                    football.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in Rye did you ever get in to New York to
                        the UN or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Oh sure! I mean as a kid living in the suburbs we went into New York for
                    one thing or another; and, of course, we did the standard, “let's go see the UN”
                    kind of tour. And I do remember following major developments at the UN. I
                    remember listening to the Israeli Ambassador to the UN Abba Eban make his
                    elegant speeches in British English.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did you go to Williston?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: My 10th grade was a little bit dramatic. In the Fall I had my jaw broken in
                    two places during football practice. During my recuperation, with my jaw wired
                    shut, I lost 20 pounds in a month because I could only take liquids. And I was
                    not overweight to begin with. And I wasn't really doing that well in school.
                    Half way through the school year my father said “Well Jim, maybe you would want
                    to go away to school for your last two years of high school. Since I was off the
                    football team and kind of out of it for a long time, I was willing to do that.
                    Ironically, I played football during my two years at boarding school. To get
                    into Williston, I had to go to its summer school to improve my writing skills. I
                    had an absolutely marvelous English teacher who really excited me in writing.
                    Certain teachers have tremendous effects on you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: His last name was Robinson. We called him Mr. Robinson. He was very
                    enthusiastic about his subject, would stand on his desk and quote poetry.
                    Actually I really learned how to write in the Foreign Service, but of course
                    that is a different form of writing. But Williston gave me the basics and had a
                    big impact. Not that I particularly liked being there. In fact, for many years
                    thereafter, my best friends remained those I grew up with in Rye. But Williston
                    gave me a good academic base, taught me how to study, and I was able to get into
                    Cornell University. I majored in Political Science there, which at Cornell is
                    known as “ Government”. We had absolutely superb professors in that particular
                    field, Cornell, and that experience also whetted my appetite for international
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Cornell from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: 1959 to 1963.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why Cornell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well! My father had gone to Cornell. We did look at a few other schools but
                    I visited the Cornell campus, liked it and actually applied nowhere else. I
                    can't imagine doing that today. But Cornell advised Williston that if I applied
                    I would be accepted. It was a very simple process. That is why I went to
                    Cornell. It could have gone someplace else but Cornell just made sense to
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say that Cornell at that time had a pretty
                        diverse student body that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MACK: It was diverse in terms of international students, but in terms of U.S.
                    citizens it was overwhelmingly white.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took courses mainly in Political Science?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes, mostly Political Science, History that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cornell at one point had quite a reputation for its
                        courses in Southeast Asia and Indonesia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes, they had an excellent Southeast Asia Study Program. I did actually
                    take a couple of courses of Southeast Asia in History or Politics, also on Mao
                    Zedong's China and the Cultural Revolution. I almost became a Southeast Asian
                    person as opposed to a Latin American person.</p>
                <p>But let me tell you, when I was at Cornell there was a campus organization called
                    Cornell United Religious Work, funded by the University, that had International
                    Summer Programs for students. One of them was a summer program in Honduras. Few
                    people knew about Honduras. The program sounded interesting to me. I had been
                    studying Spanish, so in the summer between my junior and senior year, I joined a
                    group of about six of seven other students and lived in a little house in a
                    little mountain town called Valle de Angeles, outside the capital. Honduras was
                    quite a eye opener for me, both the Caribbean coast side, where we spend a few
                    days when we first arrived, and the little mountain town where we spent about 6
                    weeks.</p>
                <p>As I said, Honduras came as quite a shock to me, a kid from the suburbs of New
                    York City. There was so much poverty. We arrived on Honduras north coast city of
                    San Pedro Sula at a time when thousands of kids were sickened by gastro
                    enteritis caused by contaminated water. But I found the whole scene fascinating.
                    By the time I returned to the US I spoke half decent Spanish. Actually when I
                    finished the Honduras program, I traveled though Nicaragua to Costa Rica on the
                    basic transportation at the time, which was a “bus” consisting of a wooden
                    superstructure built on to a truck chassis. In Costa Rica, I stayed with the
                    family of Carlos Manuel Rojas, a Sigma Chi fraternity brother, which was a
                    wonderful experience. His family owned a big cattle ranch on the northern coast
                    of the country. This was something that I had never experienced before,
                    including riding horses.</p>
                <p>Shortly after returning to the US, I took the Foreign Service Test. I was only
                    twenty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was about 1962 or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>MACK: Yes, in September, 1962 when I came back to the US. I forgot one thing.
                    While I was living in this little Honduran mountain village, we were visited by
                    the labor attache of he US embassy in Tegucigalpa. He had been a labor organizer
                    for the AFL-CIO. He was one of many labor union activists brought into the
                    Foreign Service at the start of the Cold War to support the democratic labor
                    movement overseas in their battles with the Communist labor movement supported
                    by the Soviet Union. In any event, he came up and talked to us about what he
                    did. And that really turned me on, particularly to the Foreign Service although
                    I had previously planned to take the test. But that really excited me. I took
                    the written test before the start of my senior year.</p>
                <p>I took the orals in Washington in late May of 1963, the week before I graduated.
                    Frankly, I never expected to pass the written exam, much less the orals. So here
                    I was. I hadn't yet received my college diploma, I was 21, and I had a big
                    decision to make.</p>
                <p>I had been accepted in the Peace Corps and but had this chance to go into the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>I should back track a bit here to tell you something else. I am quite hard of
                    hearing, always have been. In fact I wear two hearing aids today. I did not when
                    I was a student although if the technology had existed at the time, I should
                    have.</p>
                <p>Like many university students facing the military draft in those days, I elected
                    to go into ROTC, the Reserve Officers Training Program, offered at Cornell. This
                    is a four year program, that includes summer boot camp before the junior and
                    senior year. Upon graduation, students are commissioned as second lieutenants
                    and do 2 years active duty. I completed the first two years of the program. At
                    that point, before entering the “advanced” program, that is after the first two
                    years, cadets are subjected to a major physical exam. I flunked the hearing test
                    royally. So my post college plans of doing two years as junior officer in Army
                    intelligence went up in smoke. So I had to hustle for something else to do.</p>
                <p>And the result was that I took the Foreign Service Test and, in my senior year,
                    also applied to Peace Corps. The Peace Corps had already accepted my before I
                    took my Foreign Service orals in late May . So after I was told I had passed the
                    orals, I asked one of the examiners what I should do. He told me I was a young
                    guy; hadn't even graduated from college yet; that while I could come into the
                    Foreign Service, I really should go into the Peace Corps first. The Foreign
                    Service, he said, would hold the commission for me until I completed my Peace
                    Corps Service. He said that when I got out, I would be older, more mature, speak
                    really good Spanish, and be much more useful to the Foreign Service. That made
                    sense to me so I said, “fine”! It turned be to be great advice and that is what
                    I did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I must say that one of the things that often hurts kids
                        starting out is a lack of maturity. There is no point in having to go
                        through maturation process after you enter the Foreign Service. Do you
                        recall any of the questions that were asked of you in the oral-exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I remember one, but I don't remember the answer I gave. The question was if
                    you were stranded on a desert island in the South Pacific somewhere and you
                    could have only three books, which three would you choose — things like that. I
                    can't recall the other questions. There were questions basically that would make
                    you think a little bit or catch you off guard or make you sweato see how you
                    responded. The oral exam was a nerve-wracking experience. Here I am a twenty-one
                    old kid and I am answering questions from fairly senior people in the Nation's
                    Capital. I was pretty nervous, tingling the whole time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well tell me, when you were at Cornell did the idea of
                        public service come up. Did you get caught up in the Kennedy Phenomena?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Oh well, let me tell you what actual happened. Yes, there was a lot of
                    that. I applied to the Peace Corps because that was one of Kennedy's big
                    initiatives. And, like most people in the Foreign Service, I do believe in
                    national service; and I do believe in giving back. Obviously, I had a very
                    privileged background. I had an excellent education and I had two wonderful
                    parents who loved me and took care of me and encouraged and supported me all the
                    time. And I felt I owed something to my society. When I was not able to go into
                    the military and Kennedy came along and talked about the Peace Corps, I was very
                    moved. The Peace Corps had only been around a year or so when I applied. The
                    Peace Corps started in 1961. Some of the first returned volunteers where
                    involved in our training when I joined in August 1963 when I joined. So it was a
                    pretty exciting time. So the answer was absolutely, yes. Kennedy had a major
                    impact. So like all other Americans including yourself probably, you know
                    exactly where you were when he was assassinated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yeah!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I was in a little town in northern New Mexico in a Peace Corps training
                    program when I found out. So we were all doubly motivated to carry on. So guess
                    where they sent me? Honduras!!!. I had been hoping they would send me somewhere
                    else. I wanted to go to a Spanish speaking country obviously because I spoke
                    some Spanish, but a different one. But the great powers in the Peace Corps must
                    have looked at my resume thought I should go back to Honduras. However, I did
                    not go back to the little town where I had lived the previous summer. I was
                    assigned a town located a hundred miles away. I had an absolutely fabulous two
                    years in the Peace Corps.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get a feel for the Peace Corps of that time, it
                        was really very new. Did you have the feeling that you were on the cutting
                        edge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Oh Yeah! The first volunteers (nurses and public health people) to serve in
                    Honduras had only arrived one year before and still had one year to go in their
                    tour. My group was sent to work in what they called “Community Development”.
                    Understand that we are talking about a Cornell political science major from
                    suburban New York working in Community Development. I also worked in
                    agriculture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the major Agricultural Schools of the United
                        States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Cornell yes, but I did not study at the ag school. I had no experience in
                    agriculture at all. But with the help of a North Carolina-trained UN/FAO ag
                    engineer from Bolivia assigned to Honduras named Hector Lizarraga, and, of
                    course, the campesinos I worked with, I was able to learn the things I needed to
                    know. One of my projects was to introduce improved varieties of corn and beans,
                    plus chemical fertilizer, in the little villages around the town I lived in. My
                    town, a municipal center, had only 6,000 people at the time, no paved roads, no
                    banks, and electricity only two hours a night. I also worked in a literacy
                    program and set up a Savings and Loan Co-operative for School Teachers. I was
                    really busy. And I loved it. It was the happiest, most satisfying two years of
                    my young life up to that point. As a matter of fact, I stayed on a little longer
                    than I was supposed to because I felt I had to complete some projects. I was
                    well received by the Hondurans and I have nothing but good memories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have been the first time they had been up
                        against a Community Development type person.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Right!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how does one arrive in almost a piping voice and say,
                        “Here I am”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes, “Here I am.” Exactly! Basically that was it. The Deputy Director of
                    the Peace Corps dropped me off at a boarding house in Siguatepeque after a 5
                    hour jeep ride over a winding dusty “highway” that looked like photos of the
                    Burma Road during World War II. Siguatepeque had a delightful climate, cool. It
                    was 3,600 above sea level, set in a valley surrounded by pine forested
                    mountains.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>The boarding house, which was my first home in Siguatepeque, was run by a
                    formidable woman. Do�a Margarita Raucher was her name. She was Honduran, married
                    to a German whom I think had been raised in Guatemala.. In addition to running
                    the boarding house, she was a community organizer, and the real power in the
                    family. For example, she had organized a youth group which had a basketball
                    team. And not only that, with Do�a Margarita's encouragement, the team was in
                    the process of improving a vacant dirt lot that served as our basketball court,
                    putting up the backboards and stringing light bulbs around the court for
                    illumination, and I mean regular light bulbs, not floodlights. But hey!
                    Everybody was very excited about this. That was when I showed up. At that time,
                    Hondurans assumed that all “Gringos” were a great basketball players. Well, I
                    was a normal American kid, in good physical shape who knew how to play
                    basketball; but that did not make me a great basketball player. But given what I
                    was competing against, I was considered a solid member of the team. So basically
                    my introduction to my Peace Corps community was as a member of the los Pinares
                    basketball team playing against their arch rivals from a town called Comayagua
                    30 miles away. We lost but played a good game and everyone was very excited. All
                    of a sudden everyone in town knew who Jim Mack was. That introduced me to the
                    community and expanded my contacts in town very quickly.</p>
                <p>The rural villages around Siguatepeque were a totally different issue. However,
                    it turned out that the priest in Siguatepeque, Father Antonio Juarez, one of the
                    relatively few Honduran-born priests in the entire country, had studied in
                    Vermont and Montreal. He was a very bright guy, fluent in French and English. He
                    was also a recovering alcoholic. He told me that his return to Honduras after
                    years of seminary in North America had been a shock. He had been assigned to
                    Siguatepeque where he had almost no intellectual peers, and started drinking. He
                    told me that he had just about killed himself drinking, but several years before
                    I arrived had become sober and started a local chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous.
                    Father Juarez became my best friend. We even went on trips around Honduras
                    together in his jeep. He was a wonderful guy. A great friend,. He took upon
                    himself to instruct me in local Spanish slang and local history and so I really
                    learned a lot from him. Interestingly, I also was befriended by a US evangelical
                    missionary couple living in Siguatepeque, Ralph and Mary Keep, who happened to
                    be very good friends of Padre Juarez.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What religious background you come out of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I came out of a Presbyterian background.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>But the point you asked me is how I gained access to the rural communities in the
                    mountains around Siguatepeque. Well, Padre Juarez also served 45 little villages
                    in the mountains that that surrounded the town. Get thiof the total of 25,000
                    people living in his parish, only 6,000 lived in town. The rest were scattered
                    around the mountains, and I am talking about serious mountains. His job was
                    basically to hit the patron saint (feast ) day of each of the 45 villages. That
                    is about all he could do. He could not say mass out there regularly. There were
                    too many villages. He had another priest working with him, but serving 25,000
                    people was quite a daunting task, really impossible.</p>
                <p>But, he knew everybody because every little village had a parish representative,
                    a lay person who would come in and visit with Padre Juarez regularly,
                    participate in his catechism class and that sort of thing. So Padre was the one
                    who opened the door for me to all these people, to tell them that “this guy Mack
                    was okay, and this is what he wants to do in your village. When he comes to
                    visit, show him around and work with him.” So all of a sudden, thanks to Padre
                    Juarez, the doors opened all over the mountains.</p>
                <p>Here is a funny story. Once I ventured beyond the mountainous boundaries of Padre
                    Juarez's extended Parish to a very remote village, almost completely indigenous,
                    a very difficult 6 hours walk away by trail. I had gone to find out if the
                    people would be interested in my setting up a radio (literacy) school as part of
                    a program run the Catholic Church over its radio station, called “Radio
                    Catolica”. The idea was that we would select a literate person in a village who
                    would serve as the tutor to the illiterate students, following instructions from
                    the radio announcer. For example, the announcer would instruct the tutor to draw
                    the letter “o” on the blackboard and the tutor would do so, helping the others
                    to copy it. I had set up this program in a number of villages within Padre
                    Juarez' Parish with his support.</p>
                <p>Well, I thought my exploratory visit had been successful since I was well
                    received, and in fact spent the night in a house in the village. So on my next
                    visit, I took along my Peace Corps partner, Mary Wazeter, a Wellesley graduate
                    from Dobbs Ferry, NY and a herself Catholic, to actually bring in the required
                    materials, train up the tutor and start the program. Anyway, to get there I had
                    to lug on my back a blackboard plus a big old fashioned battery-powered radio 15
                    miles over the mountains.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, I had not “cleared” the program with the priests of the distant
                    parish to which the village belonged. Big mistake!! Unbeknownst to me, the
                    villagers had traveled to priests of their parish, American Dominicans as it
                    turned out, to ask if they should cooperate with the “gringos”. Something must
                    have gotten lost in the translation, but the Dominican suspected that I was a
                    protestant missionary, and instructed the villagers not to cooperate.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>After spending the night with the same friendly family which has hosted me on my
                    previous visit, Mary Wazeter and I awoke to a house surrounded by 200 very
                    unfriendly-looking Indians who escorted us en masse out of the village. Only
                    months later did we realize what had happened after a chance encounter with the
                    American priests in the town they lived in. We all had a good laugh, and they
                    sent word back to the village that we were oso we finally set up the literacy
                    school.</p>
                <p>But in Father Juarez's extended parish, I had basically a free pass and as a
                    result I was able to carry out both my literacy and corn and bean projects.
                    Regarding the latter, what I would do, with the help of the local campesino, was
                    plant my improved corn and bean seed using different combinations and amounts of
                    chemical fertilizer, which the UN supplied. We also planted the local corn and
                    bean seed with and without fertilizer as a comparison. At the end of the growing
                    season we would weigh the results and see who had produced more. .</p>
                <p>As I said, I was taught to do this by a Bolivian Agricultural Engineer named
                    Hector Lizarraga, a North Carolina State grad, who was working for the Food and
                    Agricultural Organization (FAO ) of the UN. My ag project was not very
                    complicated. But Lizarraga needed people to help him who had strong legs and
                    liked to hike in the mountains which I did and still do, and was willing to go
                    out on the countryside and make contact with the farmers. I put experimental
                    plots in, dozens of them, all over the countryside. And the door was opened for
                    me by my good friend, Padre Antonio Juarez, the local priest.. I followed up
                    with the literacy program that I described to you. We did this for two
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your improved corn and beans prove better than the
                        local corn and beans, which are indigenous to Central America? Were the
                        results a lot better?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>MACK: Well actually they were. The first year my corn was astoundingly better. We
                    planted my corn and theirs in identical sized plots next to each other. My corn
                    grew tall and strong and the ears were heavy with corn kernels. We weighed both
                    types. It was marvelously successful. Our corn produced triple the local
                    variety. At the end of the year, I remember I was on top of a mountain with one
                    family, indigenous, very nice people, very warm people, humble, dirt floor poor
                    people. Poorer you couldn't get. But these were really good people. If you took
                    their kids and raised them in the U.S. they would be very successful people.
                    That is one thing I found out. In any event, The guys name was “Don” Domingo. In
                    Central America every adult male has the honorific “Don” before his given name.
                    As I said my corn produced at least triple what his did, growing right next to
                    his. I was all excited and said to Don Domingo. “Do you know what that means?
                    Even deducting the cost of fertilizer and improved seed, by planting my corn you
                    would end up with double the income from the same amount of land.” . He looked
                    at me and said, “yes that is true but you know, if I planted your corn and
                    fertilizer on just half the area, I could produce as much corn as I did before
                    and work only half as much.” That day I learned a very good cultural lesson;
                    that while we “gringos” think that producing more with the same effort is best,
                    Honduran farmers at the time were not at that time terribly interested in
                    producing more, but the same with less effort. Remember, they planted corn, one
                    seed at a time, with a wooden stick with a metal tip. They did not plow. And
                    they weeded by hand with at hoe. No Round Up. People had been farming this way
                    for a thousand years. That is how primitive it was. One reason they did not
                    think in terms of increasing production was they thought they had enough to live
                    on. They ate chicken from time to time, and occasionally eggs, but what they ate
                    all the time was corn tortillas and beans, which they grew for themselves. There
                    was not much to buy. Remember cheap transistor radios were only beginning to
                    appear at that time. There were no roads near their homes, only steep trails, so
                    a bicycle or a motorcycle was useless. There was no electricity so electrical
                    devices would have been useless. There was only a main road from the Capital to
                    the coast, which was unpaved. It was not going to do a whole lot of good for
                    someone who lived an hour and an half hike up the mountain. So these people
                    really felt they did not have much to buy. That has all changed now. When the
                    small transistor radio came in, as opposed to the larger battery-powered radio,
                    that brought about a revolutionary change in Central America.</p>
                <p>I had wanted to go to grad school after the Peace Corps and write a thesis on the
                    “Impact of the Introduction of Transistor Radios on Cultural Patterns of Rural
                    Farmers in Central Honduras.” I applied to the University of Texas Latin
                    American Studies Program, but was rejected. I guess in 1965 I had a lot of
                    competition from people trying to avoid the draft. In fact, I noted that some of
                    volunteers who came to replace us in 1965 had joined up to avoid going to
                    Vietnam. That was not the motivation of our group at all back in 1963.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there also a question of who was going to supply the
                        fertilizer, who was going to supply the seed? Because in a way this made the
                        farmers more dependent on somebody else?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>MACK: Absolutely. Fertilizer was only used primarily by larger farmers of which
                    there were not many. But most people in that part of the country were small
                    farmers, “campesinos” My expectation was that over-time that the private sector
                    would respond to this need and simply begin to sell fertilizer to small farmers.
                    That is exactly what has happened. Keep in mind that where I was living there
                    were no vast expansive flatlands you can run a tractor over. The terrain was
                    very mountainous, and often the soil very acidic that had to be adjusted with
                    lime to be productive, although citrus grew well. And if you are going to spend
                    all that money to adjust your soil you probably should very higher value product
                    than corn and beans, such as vegetables. That is what farmers are doing in
                    Siguatepeque today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about land ownership? What were you observing sort of
                        the sociapolitical social guide?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: This was a very interesting situation. Some of the farmers in certain parts
                    of the area “owned” their little piece of land. I don't mean they had a formal
                    title, but everybody knew who “owned” what land. However, without a formal
                    title, it was impossible to get a loan.</p>
                <p>However, there was one huge tract of land that was owned by a large absentee
                    landowner, who did not reside in my municipality. He resided in a municipality
                    (like a county) at a much lower altitude over the mountain and so his overseers
                    accessed it from another direction. Actually it was near where the American
                    priests lived who thought I was an evangelical missionary. It was a huge tract
                    of land by Honduran mountain standards, probably a square mile of land. It
                    actually was the inside of an ancient crater. Some of the campesino farmers I
                    worked with rented this land, which was flat and quite good. I felt very
                    strongly that these guys ought to be able to buy the land. They wanted to buy
                    the land. I remember going down to this other municipality, which was quite a
                    haul, several hours by bus. I walked there once. Took me two days.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I went to see this the lawyer for the owner and I asked him if he would
                    be willing to sell. There were about 600 farmers working the land there, or some
                    large number like that up there and, like I said, the land was actually quite
                    good. He was totally unwilling to sell. I was most disappointed. I was very
                    upset. But there was really nothing I could do about it. I guess my social
                    activist side began to show its head there because I just felt that these people
                    really ought to be able to buy the land they were working.</p>
                <p>It is very clear to me when people own their own land they invest in improving
                    the land. They plant high value, permanent crops. Citrus would have grown very
                    well there. Coffee would have grown very well there. Those are crops in those
                    days fetched quite good prices. Coffee in particular could be transported out
                    easily by mule. So, I thought the people could significantly improve their lives
                    by owning the land they worked rather than planting corns and beans, which is
                    what they were doing. That was my take on it. But my efforts did not succeed.
                    That was one of my failures.</p>

                <p>MACK: Padre Juarez was not a revolutionary, but he certainly believed in social
                    justice. He had come from very humble origins. His father was a carpenter and he
                    was very dark-skinned, of mixed raced and clearly had a sense of wanting people
                    on the bottom to have a chance to move up. But he was not a practitioner of
                    liberation theology. I happened to get quite involved in that issue in El
                    Salvador after I had joined the Foreign Service.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We will pick that up later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: At the time liberation theology did not loom very large in my thinking.
                    Ironically, I did once meet a priest friend of Padre Juarez who was an American.
                    His name was Father Carney. His parish was in United Fruit's the banana
                    producing area near the Caribbean coast of Honduras. Years later I learned that
                    Father Carney had joined a Honduran Marxist Leninist Guerrilla group.
                    Apparently, he had become radicalized, had gone to Nicaragua, I think in the
                    early 80s, then under control of the Sandinistas and trained there with a group
                    of Honduran revolutionaries. He reentered Honduras with this group across the
                    mountains. The area is difficult and he was no kid at that point. He must have
                    been in his fifties by then. And apparently, as I understand it, he just
                    couldn't keep up with his comrades as they were being tracked by the Honduran
                    army. He had a bad leg, and at one point he just told them he could not continue
                    and so they left him. He probably died there. Later it was alleged they the
                    Honduran Army had captured an tortured him to death but I do not believe that
                    was the case. He probably died of exposure and dehydration. That was very rough
                    country.</p>
                <p>But at the time that I met him Father Carry. He just seemed to be a normal
                    priest. Happened to be an American, a friendly guy. I had no impression at all
                    that he was radicalized. When I went back to Central America in the early 80s as
                    a Foreign Service officer, I did have substantial contacts with Spanish Jesuit
                    liberation theology priests in El Salvador, several of whom were latter murdered
                    by the members of the Salvadoran army. .</p>

                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>MACK: Sure! Honduras was and remains one of the three poorest countries in the
                    Americas. Back in the 60's, the vast majority of the population lived in rural
                    areas. With the exception of San Pedro Sula in the north coast and the capital,
                    Tegucigalpa, Honduras was a mostly collection of small towns and villages. The
                    road network was very, very, very limited. Only on the coast and particularly
                    where the foreign-owned banana plantations were located was the infrastructure
                    any good with paved roads, electricity and that sort of thing. But the mountain
                    interior was very, very, backwards. Except for a few roads, things moved on
                    people's backs and on the backs of horses and burros. So we are talking about a
                    very primitive social-economic life style which probably hadn't changed a whole
                    lot, for hundreds of years.</p>
                <p>All the problems with corruption and inefficiency and lack of education permeated
                    Honduras at that time. You had underpaid, under trained officials, who along
                    with teachers were often paid months late. In fact, the reason one of my
                    projects was to set up a savings and loan cooperative for the teachers was
                    precisely because they were forced to obtain loans from local merchants while
                    they waited for their late pay checks to arrive. The merchants charged 10%
                    interest for each month they check had not arrived. Our cooperative charged 1% a
                    month.</p>
                <p>But, there were islands of development in places such San Pedro Sula, which is
                    the largest city in the country and it is near the north coast. But, where I
                    was, we are talking about very basic places. And at that time, Honduras was not
                    terribly over-populated. It only had 2 million people in an area the size of New
                    York State. Today it has over 7 million, over triple the population in forty
                    years. Think about that? And that is in spite of out migration. But now they
                    have terrific environmental problems. They have chopped down most of their
                    beautiful pine forests. There has been mass rural to urban migration of people
                    not prepared to live successfully in an urban environment, and tremendous social
                    dislocation. The family structure was never very strong in Honduras.
                    Illegitimacy must have been 80 percent. When most lived in rural areas this was
                    not such a big problem. But in urban areas social controls have broken down.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>When I was there in the Peace Corps, the President was a army colonel named Lopez
                    Arellano who had staged a coup against the left of center president elect just
                    before our Peace Crops group arrived. In fact, for a while during our training,
                    we thought the Peace Corps might even cancel our assignments in protest. But we
                    were eventually sent. There were elections while I was there, and they were not
                    terribly free. In those days, there were two major political parties, and
                    interestingly enough, the rural people were split almost down almost right down
                    the middle in their party loyalties. So I worked with campesinos who supported
                    both sides. The party in power, and on whose ticket Col Lopez ran, was the so
                    called, the “Nationalist” Party, which was the conservative Party. On election
                    day the parties would rent trucks to bring their rural voters to the polls in
                    Siguatepeque. The Army stopped truckloads of farmers who were coming to vote for
                    the other party opposition party and took way their “cedulas”, their national ID
                    cards, so they could not vote. How do I know this? Because I worked with these
                    guys. After they were taken down from the trucks and had their cards seized or
                    destroyed, they came to see me to complain. I had been working projects with
                    people from both sides. Both groups were poor. The farmers simply voted for the
                    party their fathers had voted for. They asked me if I could do something about
                    it the coercion and fraud. Of course, I couldn't do anything about it other than
                    commiserate with them. But, it certainly bothered me greatly. I was really
                    outraged that this kind of thing happened. But! That was the nature of the
                    society in which I was operating.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: Not to the degree that El Salvador had the famous fourteen families. No.
                    Because it was a more diffuse society. It was a more traditional society with a
                    lot of poor people living all over the mountainside in little communities
                    farming small plots of land. There may have been richer or smaller farmers but
                    no much of the huge “terrateniente” (huge landowners of a type) you would see in
                    El Salvador at that time.</p>

                    people of mixed European/Indian ancestry, but a great number are of largely
                    Indian ancestry. The Indian cultural influence remained very strong in many
                    ways, in the food, for example, as well as in many of the beliefs, customs and
                    physical gestures. Many of he words for many basic things like cooking
                    implements, certain foods, tools, building materials, the corn planting cycles
                    were of Indian origin.</p>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>MACK: Some of them were peripheral Maya people. But most of Honduras lay outside
                    Maya Empire. However, there is a major Mayan center site near the Guatemalan
                    border in a place called Copan. Even in my town of Siguatepeque, people
                    occasionally found Mayan-style pottery, although not as sophisticated as that
                    found in the Maya heartland. In fact, I have some in my house. Those particular
                    pieces were discovered when a bulldozer that was leveling dirt street in town
                    unearthed it. It was chipped by the bulldozer. And somebody said “oh look at
                    that”. I heard about it, went to see the person and offered to buy it.. I bought
                    a couple of pieces and chards and have been carrying them with me ever since.
                    Obviously locked up because they are pretty fragile.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: No. As I said, the first two groups served in Honduras before the Vietnam
                    war was an issue. Those volunteers were idealistic, largely motivated by desire
                    to serve and by patriotism. That changed somewhat as the Vietnam war heated up
                    and the Peace Corps began to attracted some guys who, as I said, were seeking to
                    avoid military service. That is why so many people went to grad School to get a
                    deferment. But when I was there, that was not the case at all.</p>

                    thirty-some odd people in my Peace Corps group. I should note that when I was in
                    Honduras, there were maybe forty or fifty volunteers in the whole country. Later
                    the Honduras program became huge, with four or five hundred volunteers. It
                    seemed every town had one. I was the first ever volunteer in my town. Then after
                    about a year I was joined by a young woman (I mentioned above), who had trained
                    in my group, but had been sent somewhere else until she had medical problem.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>MACK: Well, what happened a month later was that I joined the Foreign Service.
                    Six months before at the end of my tour with the Peace Corps I received a
                    telegram, an old fashion Morse code telegram. That is how people communicated in
                    Honduras, via telegrams send to the telegraph office. The phones were the crank
                    type, almost impossible to hear, especially for me.</p>
                <p>Of course the telegraph operator in Siguatepeque knew everything that was going
                    on. I received a telegram that said I had been accepted into the Foreign Service
                    to start in the class in January of 1966, and my starting salary would be
                    $7,200. And by the way, I had been brought in at a higher level because they had
                    given me credit for the Peace Corps. Well, within a half a day the whole town
                    knew this, and that I was going to be making $7,200 a year. That was a huge
                    amount of money for Siguatepeque. I was very embarrassed because my Peace Corps
                    salary I think was $75 a month, which is what a high school teacher made and
                    quite adequate for my simple life style. I actually saved $25 a month of that.
                    One reason was I that I almost never drank beer. If you drank beer you went
                    through you pay pretty fast. But I didn't and I was able to rent my little
                    two-room house and eat, buy clothes and shoes and do everything else I needed to
                    do on $50 a month. My rent was $16 a month.</p>
                <p>So, I was embarrassed that people in Siguatepeque knew I was would be making so
                    much money in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>Then all of a sudden, “gee”, Mack was going to have a salary of $7200. Well
                    anyway I left Honduras in December 2005, spent Christmas with my family in Rye
                    and then sometime in January I went down to Washington and joined the Foreign
                    Service A-100 course for new FSOs. I should tell you a funny story. One day I
                    was driving to FSI which then located was located in Arlington Towers in
                    Rosslyn. Basically it was a garage at that complex turned into classrooms. I
                    don't know if you remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Yes. I remember even being evacuated from there at
                        one-point because the carbon dioxide level got too high.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I was living, get this, in Georgetown in a small apartment, actually what I
                    was told were renovated former slave quarters, just off “M” Street that cost me
                    $125 a month furnished, including utilities. One day I was commuting to work
                    along M street to Key Bridge and happened to find my self behind a DC Transit
                    Bus, Washington's privately owned bus company that preceded Metro. On the back
                    of the bus there was a sign that said, “Wanted, DC Transit Bus Drivers, Starting
                    salary $9,900 a year”. Then it really hit me. $7,200 really wasn't that much
                    money in the US. I thought that was very, very funny. I wasn't making a lot of
                    money and even back then $7,200 didn't go very far.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>So I joined the Foreign Service and assumed I would be sent back to Latin
                    America. But early on in the A-100 course (the basic course for incoming FSOs) I
                    had a meeting with my Personnel Officer to tell her that prior to leaving the
                    Peace Corps I had been offered a Peace Corps management job by Frank Mankiewicz,
                    then Deputy Director of the Peace Corps to the famous Sergeant Shriver. The job
                    offer come from Mankiewicz when he stopped by my little Peace Corps town for a
                    few hours on a visit to volunteers in Honduras. Apparently I made a good
                    impression on him and he asked if I would like to be the Deputy Peace Corp
                    Director in Costa Rica. I was thinking this would be great. I would postpone my
                    Foreign Service career and be a Deputy Peace Corps Director in Costa Rica, which
                    for guys in the Peace Corps was considered a really neat place to be. The girls
                    are beautiful, just a paradise. Anyway I told the Foreign Service Personnel
                    officer I wanted to take leave right away from the Foreign Service and go to
                    Costa Rica as a Deputy Peace Corps Director. She responded to me firmly, in a
                    deep southern accent, “Mr. Mack have you joined the Foreign Service or are you
                    still in the Peace Corps?” I said, “Well, Mime I guess I am in the Foreign
                    Service.” She then said, “well I guess that is that.” Then she asked me if I
                    would be willing to serve in South Vietnam? I said, “yes”. At that point I did
                    not think much more of the Vietnam part of the conversation.. In those early
                    days of the war, not many Foreign Service Officers were being assigned to
                    Vietnam to positions other than in the US Embassy itself. They were not being
                    assigned to the provinces in the “CORDS” program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about 1966, early '66?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: We are talking about early 1966. Then came the fateful day in April in the
                    famous A-100 Course, when the first assignments are announced.. You remember the
                    big day?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh Yeah!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: They were reading off the assignments. Mary to Rome, Harry to Madrid, Joe
                    to London, Mike to Stockholm, Jane to Paris, George to Buenos Aires, all these
                    great places. Each time a big cheer. And then they called my name. “Jim Mack,
                    Saigon, South Vietnam.” Silence. I was the only one in my A-100 class to be
                    assigned to Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to quickly add, that I talked a little about
                        the A-100 course. What was its composition and what was your impression of
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Interestingly enough of the 30 or so people in my class, about 4 or 5 of us
                    were former Peace Corps volunteers. That remained true for a number of
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was with the Board of Examiners at one point and we
                        looked long and hard at Peace Corps volunteers because of what they had been
                        through.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: You knew they could certainly live successfully outside the United States.
                    There were certainly some very, very talented people. There also were also 4 or
                    5 women out of 30. It wasn't half, obviously. It was smaller numbers in those
                    days. I don't recall any minorities in our class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was still a group that was still not really focused
                        on in Vietnam. I mean insofar as it might impact them.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Correct. By the way, everybody wasn't an Ivy League grad. The myth that all
                    FSOs had gone to Ivy League colleges had persisted for years. But it was simply
                    not true. Obviously, you are dealing with very smart people. And a fair number
                    did go to prestigious schools, but I'd say that far less than a third went to
                    Ivy League Schools. So that myth wasn't even true forty years ago. It may have
                    been true sixty or eighty years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it might have been before the war but after the
                        war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Are you talking about after the Second World War?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I am still talking about World War II. The GI Bill
                        changed the whole thing. And even those who went to the Ivy League Schools,
                        these were farm boys or something who got the GI Bill and who said, hey,
                        this Harvard sounds good, I will go there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Exactly! Exactly! The number of people who came from blue blood families
                    wasn't that high. I am sure there were some, but nobody was talking about his
                    gene pool.. It really wasn't like that at all. They were just a bunch of smart,
                    “with it”, very nice people. And we had a great time in the A-100 course. By the
                    way one of my classmates, a Mary Ryan rose to be the Assistant Secretary of the
                    Consular Bureau. She was the most successful person in my class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anyway you got assigned to Saigon. How did you feel about
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>MACK: Well, I guess I would say somewhere between stunned and thrilled. I
                    certainly trembled a little bit when I heard I was going to Vietnam. But! I had
                    said I was willing to go. I never thought they would send me. I figured, they
                    would say “hey! MACK is an excellent Spanish speaker. Why not send him to some
                    place in Latin America”. But, they sent me to Vietnam. I was a excited and
                    facing the assignment with some trepidation but I certainly was willing to do
                    it. I went to Vietnamese language training at the same Arlington Towers for 5
                    months. In those days when you were a Junior Officer, the system would not send
                    you to the full eleven-month hard language language course. So I only got five
                    or six months, which for Vietnamese is not enough. So I arrived in Saigon not
                    speaking very good Vietnamese. I became a very good speaker because I was there
                    for a total of three and a half years and I worked on it all the time. But since
                    I did not take the full course, I think I tested only at a 2/2 when I had
                    finished the course, which is not saying much if you are a political officer.
                    Which is what I was. So it was pretty tough at first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your deafness hurt. I think you tone the
                        language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: My deafness obviously hurt but I do happen to have a fairly good musical
                    ear even though I don't play any instrument. Mother and my sister are both
                    musical, so I inherited that. I inherited a good ear to learn languages, even
                    though I just can't hear very well. Hearing tones Vietnamese “tones” was not a
                    big problem, as long as I listened hard. Some people have excellent hearing but
                    can't “hear” the tones of a tonal language like Vietnamese. So I tested out
                    fairly decent in my MLAT aptitude test which is why they were willing to teach
                    me Vietnamese I guess. Whatever my score was, it was sufficient to teach me a
                    hard language. I don't mean to say I was a genius but I like to learn languages
                    and I like to work hard on them. I was certainly enthusiastic about learning
                    Vietnamese. And one of the best teachers I ever had for any subject was Mr.
                    Quang, one of our Vietnamese teachers. He lived and breathed what he did and we
                    were all very excited about learning.</p>
                <p>John Negroponte by the way, preceded me to Vietnam, I guess a year or two. He was
                    still there when I arrived. John spoke French rather than Vietnamese. But there
                    were some superb Vietnamese speakers in th political section who had gone
                    through full the course.</p>
                <p>One of them ended up being a translator during the Paris Peace talks. So we
                    newcomers really looked up to these guys, the same way I looked up to the first
                    generation of Peace Corps volunteers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you get there, was it '67?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I think it was December of 1966.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation like there.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: The war was all over the place. I was assigned as a Provincial Reporting
                    Officer, working out of the Embassy in Saigon but traveling frequently to the
                    Mekong Delta where the war was very, very close at hand. And I remember deep in
                    the Delta near the U Minh forest flying on a mission with a newly promoted
                    Lieutenant Colonel who was a FAC, a forward air controller, a pilot who guides
                    in air strikes. He had offered to take me up in his plane, a little single prop
                    one, like a little Cessna, when I was on a visit. He sat in the front seat, and
                    I sat in the back. And watching him mark the Viet Cong positions with smoke
                    rockets was pretty exciting. Each time he fired one, the little plane jumped. I
                    also have to admit I was very scared, In fact, the VC fired up at us too. We
                    even took a round in the wing. But I felt it was something I ought to do since
                    it was part of what was going on in the provinces I was covering. I did it only
                    once, but this guy did it every day.</p>
                <p>After two months working the Delta, a position opened up in II Corps in Central
                    Vietnam and I was sent to live in Nha Trang, a coastal city, and cover the
                    surrounding provinces from there. Nha Trang had been a French resort town.
                    Nicely laid out; very beautiful scenery. The beaches, islands and mountains
                    looked like Rio de Janeiro without the skyline. And there I worked as a
                    political advisor to the senior US official in the region, the head of what was
                    called “CORDS”, I recall one's last name was Madison. My job was to travel
                    regularly among the five coastal provinces of II Corps writing reports about
                    what was really going on in the war, and meeting with local religious (Catholic
                    and Buddhist), political, and military leaders (both US and Vietnamese) and
                    learning and writing about their attitudes towards the war. I would write what
                    we called “air-grams”, really dispatches prepared on a manual typewriter and
                    physically sent to the embassy. Air-Grams and things like no longer exist in the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>Henry Cabot Lodge was the US ambassador when I first got there, but Ambassador
                    Bunker replaced him shortly thereafter and was there for the rest of my time.
                    That is what I did and then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little bit about the Delta. Where were you
                        located in the Delta?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: When I worked the Delta, I was based of the US Embassy in Saigon. I did not
                    live in the Delta. I traveled there, would spend a few days in a province, and
                    then write a report on what I found. However, when I was transferred to II
                    Corps, I actually lived in Nha Trang. In fact, all told, I lived in four cities
                    during my 3 � years in Vietnam (Saigon, Nha Trang, Danang and Qui Nhon), and I
                    think visited all 43 or so provinces. So I got to know Vietnam quite well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go up in the Central Highlands too?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>MACK: Yes I did go up into the Central Highlands. But, I was not the primary
                    reporting officer there. Another officer handled that region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: His name was David G. Brown, not to be confused with David E. Brown. who
                    also served in Vietnam at the same time and also worked as a provincial
                    reporting officer for the political section and covering the provinces in III
                    Corps, the area around Saigon. In fact, for a time the two David Browns shared a
                    house in Saigon. Both are now long retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The South Koreans were in Vietnam too weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes, the Koreans were assigned to both parts of central Vietnam that I
                    operated in, in fact to the two provinces I lived in. One division was assigned
                    to Binh Dinh Province north of Qui Nhon city, and the other to a province just
                    south Danang.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were they doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well, they were very, very tough guys. Very effective in Binh Dinh. They
                    were feared by the Vietcong, and managed to clear out the area where they
                    operated. They were quite ruthless. Very effective tactics. They would send out
                    people who could basically dig themselves into foxholes at night all over the
                    place. When the Vietcong would come though, these guys would pop out and blow
                    away the Vietcong. They did this over a large area. They were fully quite
                    successful, cutting down infiltration by the Vietcong.</p>
                <p>Another South Korean Division was deployed was in the province that surrounded
                    the city of Danang. By the time I was assigned to Danang to head up the branch
                    consular office and also serve as political advisor to the US Commander of I
                    Corps, a Marine 3 star named Lt Gen. Cushman who later become number # 2 at the
                    CIA, the Koreans had become much less aggressive. Apparently, the Korean
                    government was under pressure to cut casualties so the Koreans had barricaded
                    themselves behind huge Maginot line of sandbags.</p>
                <p>While the Vietcong did not go through their area, the Koreans did awful things to
                    the people of the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>MACK: It was basically a Korean My Lai where they executed a whole lot people in
                    a village. At the time it was not politically correct to cast aspersion on our
                    allies. But I decided to do a little work on it. I happen to come in possession
                    of a whole lot of photographs and interviewed people who were witnesses and
                    wrote a report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened as a result of your report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I can't tell you what happened. I know the US Embassy got my report,
                    including the photographs. It was really up to the South Koreans. I don't recall
                    anything happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the war going? You were basically in II Corps and
                        then I Corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: It was both in that order. I spent 18 months in II Corps working out of Nha
                    Trang, and a year in I Corps working out of Danang. Then I spent my last six
                    months in Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the war going when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well, I was there during the huge build up of the American Forces from a
                    relatively modest number to 500,000. Then in 1969 Nixon came into office and the
                    started the “Vietnamization” program. In February 1968, during the Tet
                    offensive, I was living in Nha Trang when the city was overrun by two battalions
                    of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops.</p>
                <p>By then, the war had become less a guerilla war and more of an old fashion large
                    unit type of war. A war of mobile battalions. A lot of people today believe the
                    Tet offensive was the greatest defeat ever suffered by the U.S. It is true that
                    Tet was a great political success for the Communists which led to the decision
                    to start to withdraw US troops. However, it was, in fact, a huge military defeat
                    for the Viet Cong. To carry out the attack, the Viet Cong ordered their
                    undercover VC agents to surface and join their troops as they converged on
                    provincial capitals all over the country. But they in fact lost over 50,000 men
                    in a matter or weeks, including much of their “infrastructure”, their secret
                    cadre.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>The security situation actually improved rather dramatically after Tet 1968
                    because there were not as many Vietcong running around. What North Vietnam did
                    to compensate for the huge losses sustained by the Viet Cong was to increase the
                    pace in which they were moving regular North Vietnamese troops to the south.
                    They had been coming South as early as '1965, but the pace quickened. However,
                    they did not have as many local folks to guide them around as they had before.
                    So in one sense, things were more secure. That is not to say they were secure. I
                    mean I still had to travel between provinces mostly by air, although within the
                    provinces I could move by road. I also traveled by military helicopter dozens of
                    times as well. I left Vietnam at the end of 1969.</p>
                <p>At that point I was assigned back to the Department of State to the Bureau of
                    Intelligence and Research as an analyst on South Vietnam. A junior officer would
                    never be assigned to that job today after having spent 3 years in the same
                    country. Believe me. I didn't want it, tried to fight it, but then had no choice
                    but to take it.</p>
                <p>But you asked about security in Vietnam. In early 1973 when I was back in Qui
                    Nhon on 6 months TDY to report on the implementation of the Paris Peace Accords,
                    my wife and I drove literally all over the country alone in our sometimes not so
                    trusty International Scout. From Binh Dinh all the way up to Quang Tri on the
                    border with North Vietnam, all through the Central Highlands, and all the way
                    south to Saigon and Can Tho in the heart of the My Cong delta. I never would
                    have done this during the war. That is how things had changed. But it was the
                    lull before the storm. By that time the US Congress had pulled the plug on
                    support. US air and logistical support had dried up. When the North Vietnamese
                    launched their final offensive 2 years later in 1975, the South just
                    collapsed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The first time when you were there what was your
                        impression of the situation in villages and the central government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well first of all there was a speckled pattern of government control. By
                    that I mean some villages firmly in the government camp, some were contested,
                    and some were under Viet Cong control. Often where the Vietcong were active, a
                    lot people left and moved into the cities. Huge numbers of refugees built their
                    little houses along the road. The government was not particularly popular on one
                    hand. On the other hand, I don't think the communists were popular at all. I say
                    that as a person who traveled around unarmed, alone and very frequently.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>In Nha Trang I had a Vespa motor scooter for a while and later a white jeep. I
                    didn't drive my jeep outside of town, but I did drive my motor scooter into the
                    countryside. And I often met people who would invite me into their homes. They
                    would talk to me. I was a young guy, unarmed and in civilian clothes and I guess
                    not considered hostile or threatening. I got to meet people in virtually every
                    walk of life. It was amazing how the Vietnamese would pick you up on the street.
                    I would be going to the Buddhist Temple or something and walking around and they
                    would say, “Oh you speak Vietnamese.” All of a sudden, I would have an
                    invitation to dinner, it was absolutely amazing. I never, I won't say never, I
                    almost never felt a security threat. I can remember going to some, somewhat
                    dicey areas in the countryside and have people come up to my little motor
                    scooter and motion with their hands with a finger like this; basically what they
                    were saying was don't go that way and I turned around. That did happen. I felt
                    nearly zero hostility. I had a wonderful experience with the Vietnamese people
                    at every level of society.</p>
                <p>There were some things that outraged me, for example, the corruption in some
                    parts of the government. Some province chiefs were very, very corrupt.
                    Occasionally the government would send in someone who was really clean and I
                    would write a dispatch about him or about someone who was dirty. People were
                    skeptical about the government but those who supported the Vietcong or
                    Communists were definitely in a small minority.</p>
                <p>I really traveled everywhere, to every province in the country. I have been in
                    numerous numbers of the districts but I did not go into areas that were red on
                    the map. I did not go there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happen to you during the Tet Offensive in '68?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well, I was living in Nha Trang and sharing a regular Vietnamese house with
                    another young American civilian. It was not in an American Compound. I did not
                    live in a compound. I didn't want to live in a compound. The night before Tet
                    (The Chinese New Year) I went to sleep late at night because it very noisy, like
                    the 4th of July in the US, or New Year's eve in Latin America. Both sides had
                    agreed on a cease fire for Tet, as they had done for years. So people stayed up
                    late having a good time and drinking, eating, shooting off fire works, shooting
                    their weapons in the air, and generally making merry. And along about one
                    o'clock I went to bed with my air-conditioner on. In the early morning hours I
                    was awakened to the sound of low flying helicopters. My first reaction was to
                    think that insensitive Americans were buzzing the town when people were trying
                    to sober up from the previous night. “Gee, what the hell are they flying the
                    helicopters low over town for?” That was my first reaction. So I rolled out of
                    bed, went out my door and looked down the end of the street which is two houses
                    away, sixty feet away, and saw a jeep, a Vietnamese police jeep with water
                    leaking out of holes in the radiator. Standing with his foot on the fender was
                    an American Public Safety Advisor, German born, a real character, a cop from New
                    Jersey. I went out and asked him what the heck was going on, I said to him. He
                    answered “what the “deleted” is going on here?”. “There are two battalions of
                    North Vietnamese troops in town and they shot out my jeep.”</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>What happened was that when the North Vietnamese troops came into town under
                    cover of the truce, fireworks and general merrymaking, some units became
                    disoriented by the layout of the city and never found their targets. It so
                    happens that Nha Trang is laid out in a checkerboard pattern except that at one
                    point the streets of one part of the checkerboard intersect each other on an
                    angle. So while one section of town was logically, north, south, east, west, the
                    other section was at a slightly different orientation. And so where the roads of
                    each section intersected the North Vietnamese got totally and hopelessly lost.
                    So while one North Vietnamese unit was able to take over the lightly defended
                    provincial headquarters, dig in, others were left wandering around looking for
                    their objectives.</p>
                <p>And they were facing limited opposition because most troops were on leave for
                    Tet. One North Vietnamese unit, probably without realizing what they were
                    facing, attacked a serious of houses which formed a Korean army compound that
                    sat right next to the CORDS compound. In taking on the Koreans they made a big
                    mistake and paid for it with their lives. Other North Vietnamese soldiers
                    entered private houses and hunkered down. Then the local people started pointing
                    out their locations to the Vietnamese, Korean and US special forces troops in
                    the area. The North Vietnamese, reduced to operating in small groups, were
                    picked off one by one, their bodies scarfed up and dumped in a central part of
                    town. Over a period of several days, they had lost six or seven hundred people.
                    I don't know how many got out of town alive. But, most did not. It was a
                    disaster for them.</p>
                <p>Later on that first day, I drove around and saw all the damage and all the blown
                    up buildings, bodies of the North Vietnamese, and things. That evening, the
                    CORDs leadership instructed all the Americans associated with the CORDS program,
                    civilian and military, to come to the CORDS compound to spend the night for
                    their own protection. Since many of these folks, including military, had not
                    been in combat much, I really had no desire to spend the night with this them. I
                    thought I would be better off somewhere else. So I went to spend the night at a
                    top floor apartment in another part of town. And late that evening when I was
                    there, I remember looking at the CORDS compound in the distance seeing what
                    appeared to be a huge firefight going on.</p>
                <p>The next morning when I went back to the compound I learned that many of the
                    bullets (all outgoing) had impacted half way up a tree across from the compound
                    where someone had thought he had seen somebody. We thereafter referred the
                    purported intruder as “the ten foot tall Vietcong.” Unfortunately, the tree sat
                    immediately next to the Office of the Bishop of the Nha Trang Diocese. The
                    Bishop's personal bedroom was pierced by numerous bullets. He was not hurt,
                    fortunately. But guess who was deputized to go over to apologize to him. Me.
                    There was no Vietcong. Our people were nervous because after all there had been
                    plenty of action the previous night, including right next door. But the night
                    after Tet there were no North Vietnamese around so it fell to me to go over and
                    apologize to the Bishop of the Diocese of Nha Trang.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>But I just did not want to be a part of all these armed and nervous people. I
                    asked myself what I could contribute to protecting the compound if I spent the
                    night there. The answer was not much. If there had been a real threat, believe
                    me I would have been in that compound. I thought there wasn't. That was my sense
                    as a political officer. I thought I had a pretty good sense of what was going
                    on. So, I wanted to be somewhere else. There were just too many guns.</p>
                <p>I must tell you I did not carry a weapon in my travels. Someone did gave me a
                    very nice souvenir folding stock Kalashnikov automatic rifle and several ammo
                    clips. But I never took it out of my house, except once to test fire it. My view
                    was this. Before I went somewhere, I ought to get an intel brief and generally
                    try to figure out what was going on there. I did not worry about being
                    assassinated by some guy running up to me and shooting me in the head because
                    basically the Vietcong did not operate that way with the small fish that I was.
                    I basically operated alone. My concern was that I might run into a Vietcong
                    patrol crossing a road or something. On the other hand, how was I going to
                    defend myself against and get away from twenty guys or a company of one hundred
                    guys with just a pistol or rifle. I was going to be dead for sure. So I just
                    made a decision not to carry a weapon. I was given one once when we were in a
                    convoy in the Delta where we learned a Viet Cong unit had just passed. But that
                    was about it. If I had been really accomplished with weapons, maybe I would have
                    carried one regularly. Also I worried about losing it. A weapon is heavy. I was
                    going be meeting and talking with people, and I felt I couldn't do that if I
                    packed heat. I have nothing against weapons. I believe Americans who are
                    properly trained and tested should be able to own weapons, but in my case, I
                    just didn't think that was a smart way to go.</p>

                        your bosses in Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I had excellent bosses. Really great team of people, mentors. Officers who
                    were far more talented in drafting than I was when I got there, and who worked
                    with me and encouraged me. Dick Teare was one of them, Henry Dunlap was another.
                    It was a very positive and demanding experience. I must say I had never had to
                    write so much and so fast as I did in Vietnam. There was an insatiable appetite
                    for information. This was particularly true my last six months in Vietnam (in
                    1969) when I was brought back to Saigon from Danang to work in the political
                    section. Galen Stone was with the DCM, and the political section had 20 some odd
                    people. It was huge. Like an Embassy. There was an external unit affairs,
                    internal affairs unit, and a provincial reporting unit.</p>
                <p>When I was brought back to the political section, one of my jobs was to draft
                    what was called the “war and peace-a-gram”. It went out every week, every Monday
                    and covered Vietnamese attitudes toward the war and the internal political
                    situation. And it had to be huge. Remember this was before the era of the
                    word-processor which was maybe the greatest invention since sliced bread.
                    Particularly for someone who was a sloppy typist like me.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also a bad speller, thank god for spell-check.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: In those days you would type little pieces on your typewriter and then you
                    would literally cut and paste and that sort of thing. I had to put this thing
                    together every week. It was due in the early afternoon each Monday. Now I knew
                    there was no way I could produce a twenty-five page cable in six hours. So what
                    I had to do was to come in every Sunday right after lunch start the cable. This
                    way I had 24 hours instead of 6 to produce this report. So for six months the
                    only time I had off was Sunday mornings. That was the only time I had off. I
                    would work on this thing Sundays and then other people would give me more
                    material. It'd put it all together and then pass it on to Harry Dunlap. Remember
                    Harry! A really good guy who was head of our Internal Reporting Unit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Harry and I took Surfing lessons together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Really! Okay. So Dick Teare was the head of the Provincial Reporting Unit
                    for the first year and half or so that I was there. I can't recall if he was
                    there in my last year. But Harry Dunlap would edit it and we would get the
                    sucker out. And then I would report on the status of the constitution the
                    Vietnamese were drafting. This was '69. My beat was the National Assembly so I
                    would have a lot of contact with people who had been elected to the National
                    Assembly. And, of course, the caring and feeding of US congressional visitors
                    like Houston Congressman George Herbert Walker Bush. We would brief them. But, I
                    was really fully occupied. We just worked all through dinners and lunches.
                    Richard Nixon came to that was a story in itself. May I tell you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Richard Nixon paid a surprise visit to Saigon. I can't tell you exactly
                    when it was. It would have been in the Fall of '69. Early in the morning, I
                    received a call at home before I left for the Embassy. It was Martin Hertz, the
                    Political Counselor. He said the President of the United States is arriving in
                    three hours and you can't tell anybody. And we have selected you to do the
                    consecutive interpreting for his address to the Vietnamese Press.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Think about this. I was a quite a good Vietnamese speaker at the time. But what
                    happened was Nixon was a superb extemporaneous speaker. At the end of Nixon's
                    meeting with President Thieu, I was sitting in the side room of the national
                    palace waiting for Nixon to address the huge assembled press corps, both foreign
                    and Vietnamese. I was nervous as hell! You can imagine. There were bleachers set
                    up for the press, the Vietnamese and Foreign Press. I was suppose to do a
                    consecutive translation from English to Vietnamese. In theory that mean
                    President Nixon would speak a sentence or two, and I would translate.</p>
                <p>Well, finally the bilateral meeting with President Thieu ended and he and Nixon
                    emerged and began to speak. Unlike President Thieu who spoke first from a
                    written text which I had been able to read in advance, Nixon spoke
                    extemporaneously without stopping for at least ten or fifteen minutes. Now think
                    about this. I am not a professional interpreter. I am not a consecutive
                    interpreter. I twenty-seven years old and I am nervous as hell. The President of
                    the United States is there and hundreds of people are waiting. And the President
                    doesn't stop. So I am feverishly taking notes and after about ten minutes of
                    this was desperate. I happened to be standing next to the very professional,
                    very experienced, very smooth Chief Press Officer for the Vietnamese Government,
                    who spoke fluent English. At one point I turned to him and said “I can not do
                    this.” “There is no way I can make sense out my garbled notes on Nixon's fifteen
                    minute uninterrupted extemporaneous speech and translate it into Vietnamese. I
                    just can't do it.” I was wringing my hands. To my immense relief, he said “I
                    will take care of it”. He went out there and spoke about two minutes, supposedly
                    summarizing what the President had said. So I never did interpret for Nixon.
                    Thank God! It was a task that I was not equipped to do.</p>
                <p>I gained enormous respect for people who work in the interpreting business. And I
                    learned that interpreting is a skill, not to be confused with being able to
                    speak a foreign language well. Not to be confused in any way. And, of course, I
                    was being set up in a sense. It was not like interpreting in a small meeting for
                    visiting US Congressmen, which I did frequently. I could always stop a
                    congressman who went on too long and say, “excuse me, let me translate what you
                    just said since I can't remember a whole paragraph.”. I could control the
                    conversation. But I had absolutely no control over Nixon's monologue. I was way
                    out of my depth. I was never more relieved in my life when this elderly
                    Vietnamese gentleman (who was what my age is now said) said he would do it for
                    me. He was in charge of Press Relations for the Vietnamese Presidency. He was
                    very accomplished at it. He basically made it up. Ha! Ha! But he was speaking
                    his own language, so he was able to wing it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I left in early December of 1969. I had been there years. I arrived in
                    December of '66 and I left in December '69.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you left, did you, what were you getting from
                        your contacts. Was there a feeling of confidence or a feeling of unease?
                        What I am talking about is the Vietnamese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well! There were some war worries obviously. I think there was a feeling
                    among the Vietnamese that as long as the Americans were they were going to be
                    able to keep going. There was always a question of whether the “Vietnamization”
                    policy would work. But things were getting better. The things in the My Cong
                    Delta were definitely improving. The Vietnamese Government had begun its land
                    reform program, with US money paying for the land that was redistributed. And
                    the land there was extremely rich. Electrification was going on there.
                    Particularly when I went back in '73. Things were really going well. There
                    weren't any Vietcong running around in the Delta in '73. They really weren't.
                    Most had been exposed during the 1968 Tet offensive and over time they had
                    “attrited” was the word they use to use (or weeded out) and there were not many
                    left. The Delta was quite secure in 1973. But when I left Vietnam for the first
                    time in 1969, there were still huge numbers of American troops there. So, as
                    long as the Americans were there, the situation would be manageable. When I
                    returned in early 1973, the ceasefire had been in place for little over a month,
                    and by then the US military had already drawn down most of its troops. In fact,
                    shortly after I arrived, I personally saw off the last GIs off from II Corps out
                    of Qui Nhon harbor. They were the last 3 US divisions in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>So by February of '73 the Vietnamese were feeling very much alone, although the
                    countryside was quite secure. I told you I traveled by vehicle, unarmed with my
                    wife (my bride) through a large portion of the country. This is something I
                    never would have thought of doing when I was there between '66 and '69. But you
                    could see the North Vietnamese in some places building roads in the mountains.
                    And the South Vietnamese military were short on everything. They were short on
                    ammunition. They were short on gasoline and replacement parts. And it was a big
                    problem. They could not fire their artillery as much as they wanted. They could
                    not move their vehicles around as much as they could before. So they were
                    getting worried.</p>
                <p>We really were pulling out and they were very much alone 1973, in my last six
                    months there. They had no US military advisors to lean on. There were only a few
                    American civilians involved developmental type activities. I did get out into
                    the countryside a fair amount. I remember spending the night in a fortified
                    hamlet with my wife, being entertained by the local people. An unbelievable
                    experience. I had been well treated the first time I was in Vietnam, but even
                    better the second time. People obviously looked at an American with his wife
                    differently than a single male.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>But the South Vietnamese were worried at the time. They were very frank about it.
                    The military officers that I knew were very happy to see me around. They
                    welcomed me with opened arms. I would show up in a district mostly unannounced,
                    driving my International Scout. But I did always check the Intelligence Reports
                    before I would go anywhere to be sure the roads were open and there were no
                    problems. Folks were very happy to see us. The North Vietnamese Army had not yet
                    brought its full power to bear in most parts of the country. There was kind of a
                    Kabuki' Theatre show. In Binh Dinh Province where I lived, the South Vietnamese
                    military sometimes would take back some populated areas controlled by the
                    Vietcong and the VC would react. But it was basically a waiting period. Both
                    sides kept the fighting within bounds and limited. Clearly, the North Vietnamese
                    were waiting, building and rebuilding roads, resupplying, waiting for the big
                    moment. In hindsight that was what was happening. But at the time in early 1973
                    the environment was amazingly secure in comparison to the Vietnam that I
                    experienced between 1966-1969.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you were in Saigon up to December of '69 did
                        you feel there was pressure from the White House to put out favorable
                        reports?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I did not feel it at all. I understand things may have changed by the end
                    of 1974 and early 1975, under Ambassador Martin?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was Graham Martin.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>MACK: Yes, He was there and I understand some people felt that. I never did. I
                    never, ever felt that. I felt I could say anything that I wanted. And I did. If
                    I detected abuse, I reported it. I told you about the case of abuse by the
                    Koreans that I reported in 1969. If I learned about corruption involving the
                    Americans, like I did in 1968 at the US military huge supply base at Cam Ranh
                    Bay, where a small group of American NCOs in a supply unit were selling lighter
                    flints, batteries and other equipment to Vietcong agents, I reported it. This
                    stuff was used by the VC to manufacture explosive devices. People concerned
                    about these things, both Vietnamese and Americans, came to see me as someone who
                    would get the word up to the right places but outside the chain of command when,
                    for what ever reason, they could not. I remember an Army CID (Criminal
                    Investigative Division) guy from Cam Ranh telling showing me photographs of what
                    was going on. Apparently there was a Commanding General there who didn't want to
                    accept that this was going on in his command. So the CID guy felt stonewalled.
                    When I met with him he said, “look at this”. So I asked to give me the
                    photographs. He said, “yes, yes, I will give you the photographs.” He gave them
                    to me and I wrote a pretty graphic report like the other one with photographs to
                    prove it. Photographs showing the sergeants handing the stuff over the barbwire,
                    rather remarkable. Something was done about it and action was taken. I think the
                    General may have been removed. Now we are talking almost 40 years after the
                    event, but my recollection is that I did not feel as if I were writing under a
                    great big censor. My biggest challenge was to write to the very high standard
                    set by some very, very able Foreign Service Officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Martin Hertz was a scary guy. He could take dictation

                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes, he could take dictation and without changing a word. But that requires
                    a extraordinary high level of intelligence and focus. So it was really
                    inhibiting to work with somebody that good. And when you got a little
                    complementary note from him, with his signature that looked like a tiny flower,

                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes. This was the worst job I ever had and did. After three years in
                    Vietnam, I returned to Washington to take a job that probably would have been an
                    illegal assignment today for a junior officer. That is to assign a Junior
                    Officer, an untenured Junior Officer, to work on the same country on which he
                    had been working in the field for the three previous years. I was assigned to
                    INR to be an intelligence analyst for South Vietnam. This involved among other
                    things preparing a daily morning brief for the Assistant Secretary of East Asia
                    Affairs, it was Ambassador Sullivan. And also to write intelligence reports on
                    how I saw the internal political situation in South Vietnam at the time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am interviewing Terry Tull now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Terry Tull is an esteemed colleague and served at the same time that I did
                    as a matter of fact, in Vietnam. She worked in the Embassy political section.
                    Keep in mind what I was coming from. I had been in the field. I was a Provincial
                    Reporting Officer in Vietnam, one of the best jobs I ever had or did. So any way
                    I come back to the Department of State after three years in Vietnam to a
                    suffocating bureaucracy and without the freedom I had to move around and write
                    reports and interact with people there. In the Bureau of Intelligence and
                    Research (INR) there were six or seven layers between me and getting a paper
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this particularly because Vietnam was obviously hot.
                        Was the subject a tendency to put more people on to it. As I mentioned, Iraq
                        probably today has the same thing. I mean you throw people at the job which
                        usually doesn't make for a better product.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well, there is probably something to that. There were certainly quite a few
                    people. There must have been, I don't know, four or five people working on South
                    Vietnam at the time. Well, they were all good folks. My boss was a good guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>MACK: His name was Lou Sarris. But just getting something through Lou was very
                    difficult and it was quite a culture shock coming back to Washington, frankly. I
                    mean this in a personal sense and in a professional sense. In INR there was much
                    more time to get reports “out”, but we'd have to go through ten drafts, as
                    opposed to Vietnam where we had to get reports out very, very, quickly. I also
                    hungered for the contact with the local people that I had in Vietnam every day.
                    That was the excitement of it. In INR worked in my little windowless cubical
                    with no contact with the people whose country I was supposed to analyze.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know the feelings.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: It was socially difficult and professionally not very inspiring.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, do you recall how things were going in 70 and 71?
                        What was happening in South Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well yes. In 1971 there was a major North Vietnamese Offensive into South
                    Vietnam. The North Vietnamese Army came straight down the highway number one,
                    right on down the coastal highway in a traditional WW II type tank attack. There
                    was nothing “guerrilla” about it at all. And they managed to push the South
                    Vietnamese Army totally out of Quang Tri Province, which the northern most
                    province in South Vietnam. So the Vietnamese were quite battered. It was a
                    difficult time for them since we had already pulled all the US troops out of
                    that part of the country. So the Vietnamese had to do it themselves. And they
                    did finally did halt the North Vietnamese offensive with the help of with the
                    help of U.S. B-52's. But it was a very, very, difficult time for the
                    Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this kind of discouraging to you that the South
                        Vietnamese were unable to push back the North Vietnamese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well yes, It was discouraging and I will talk to you about that a little
                    later about what happened because I did go back to Vietnam. But it was not an
                    encouraging time. Obviously, Nixon clearly had realized that he had to get us
                    out. So US military peaked out in personnel strength there somewhere in '69.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>MACK: By 1972, US force levels had wound down considerably and the North
                    Vietnamese felt bold enough to undertake a major attack, a frontal attack on the
                    South. The North Vietnamese were never really guerrillas anyway. The South
                    Vietnamese Communists, the Viet Cong) were the guerillas. The North Vietnamese
                    were a conventional army. They fought very much like most soldiers do in the
                    world with artillery, rockets, tanks, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How you were working. Were you finding the material that
                        you came up and evaluating it or was it more a cosmetic of changing of the
                        verbiage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Obviously some of both. There also was a lot of war gaming and devils
                    advocating going on. Keep in mind, my reporting, my analysis, was not on the
                    war. It was on the internal South Vietnam Political Situation. I was not a
                    military expert. There were other people who did that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It has been said that South Vietnamese corruption and
                        political maneuvering played a major role in the collapse of South Vietnam.
                        At the time do you feel that this was part of the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Corruption definitely was an issue. I never believed that the South
                    Vietnamese people supported communism. My personal experience showed me
                    otherwise. And I believed very much that the communists could not have won a
                    free election in South Vietnam. They absolutely could not have an election.
                    People were frustrated with the corruption and getting tired of the war. Once
                    our military presence, along with our logistical support, wound down, we began
                    to see a sapping of the morale of the Vietnamese. But I really have to come back
                    to that in a later chapter. Because, there is an interlude here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: The interlude is that in late '71, I was offered an assignment as
                    Political/Labor Officer in San Jose, Costa Rica. Since I wanted to get back to
                    Latin-America, I welcomed that assignment. I got married just before I left. My
                    wife Sheila and I drove from Washington to San Jose, a wonderful trip which,
                    including stops and a visit to my old Peace Corps town in Honduras, took about 3
                    weeks. Costa Rica was an open, democratic country, a delightful place, and it
                    was easy to work there as a political/labor officer. I had been a post about a
                    year when, at the end of 1972, I think around Christmas, when the Paris Peace
                    Accords were signed.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Just a few days later, I was called to the ambassador's office. Viron Vaky was
                    Ambassador at the time. He said, “Jim, I just received a cable. You have been
                    selected as part of a group of Foreign Services Officers with Vietnam experience
                    to return to South Vietnam within a month to start a 6 month unaccompanied tour
                    to report on the progress of implementation of the Paris Peace Accords,
                    including the cease fire.” The spouses of returning officers were supposed to
                    remain in place at whatever post they were current at during this period, which
                    in Sheila's case, meant San Jose, Costa Rica. According to the Peace Accords,
                    the agreement was to be monitored by a four party International Control
                    Commission consisting of two communist states (Poland and Hungary) and two
                    non-communist states (Canada and I think Indonesia).</p>
                <p>I was ready to do my duty, and frankly rather excited about the chance to go back
                    to South Vietnam. However, as I mentioned before, my wife Sheila and I were
                    newly married. When I broke the news to her that evening, she was not happy at
                    all about my going without her. She told me flatly that she would be going too
                    and was not about to be deterred by a decision by the State Department that my
                    TDY tour was to be unaccompanied. She found my arguments that it might be
                    dangerous unconvincing. She also very quickly persuaded me to try to obtain a
                    waiver from Director General of the Foreign Service. So with the support of
                    Ambassador Vaky, I sent in an appeal. As the days ticked by with no response, I
                    decided I would try to take her no matter what. My idea was to just show up in
                    Saigon with her.</p>
                <p>With only a couple of days until departure, we finally got a cable from the
                    Director General who said I could take Sheila, but would have to pay her travel
                    costs, which were $2,500, about � of my yearly pay. Furthermore, I was told that
                    since my wife would be accompanying me, I would be required to live in a secure
                    area. We accepted that. We also left without visas since there was no South
                    Vietnamese Embassy in Costa Rica. We left San Jose at the end of January for Los
                    Angeles, and hop scotched across the Pacific — Hawaii, where we spent a couple
                    of days, Guam, Wake Island.</p>
                <p>In Honolulu, the Pan Am Ground Chief did not want to let Sheila board the plane
                    because he thought the Vietnamese would fine his company if she arrived in
                    Saigon without a proper visa. Always persuasive, Sheila prevailed upon him to
                    let her board. She had to convince the Pan Am representatives in Guam and Wake
                    Island as well. When we finally arrived in Vietnam, Lo and Behold I was able to
                    bring her into the country. Ha! Ha! We were initially going to be assigned to
                    Can Tho to work at the Consulate General.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, down in the Delta region.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>MACK: Right, and, this is really off the record. I met the guy who was going to
                    be heading up the Consulate General and realized very quickly that we were not
                    going to get along. Plus the Delta was the area with which I was least familiar.
                    I did know the Delta somewhat, but I had really operated in Central Vietnam and
                    not in the Delta. So I asked to be transferred to a Consulate General in Nha
                    Trang. My wish was granted because there happened to be another fellow officer
                    who had gone back with me who had been assigned to Nha Trang, but in fact wanted
                    to go back to Can Tho where he had once served. So it was a perfect switch.
                    Everybody was happy. However, when I got to Nha Trang, I quickly came to the
                    conclusion that I did not want to be part of the huge bureaucracy there. I also
                    knew they wanted to fill positions in the surrounding provinces and not just the
                    Consulate General. It turned out that the Political Officer in charge of the
                    Consulate General in Nha Trang, who also had been sent back for a 6 month TDY
                    was an old friend of mine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Dick Teare, who during my first tour, had been in charge of the provincial
                    reporting unit, and my first boss. Dick helped me get assigned to Qui Nhon city
                    in Binh Dinh province farther up the coast. I knew the town well and was quite
                    happy to be assigned there. I was assigned to a CORDs Office there. The
                    provincial senior advisor, a retired US Army Major, whose name I will not
                    mention, was clearly not happy to have new guy bringing his wife, and instead of
                    been given space in the little prefab homes where most personnel were housed, we
                    were given an old French Army Trailer equipped with a very narrow single bed,
                    and a closet full of hand grenades left over from who knows when. This senior
                    advisor was a very arbitrary person, with an explosive temper and often
                    threatened his local Vietnamese staff, who feared him. It was clear we were not
                    going to get along very well. However, my wife was a really good trooper. She
                    had been a VISTA volunteer in northern Arizona on the Navajo Reservation, and
                    determined not to complain. She also did not complain that her orders from the
                    moment we arrived in Vietnam had been that for security reasons, she was never
                    to travel by land out of town. It turned out we both did many times.</p>
                <p>But returning to the provincial senior advisor, his abuse of his staff was really
                    terrible. He was an alcoholic. It was a pretty serious situation. I called back
                    to Dick Teare at the Consulate General in Nha Trang and said the CG really
                    needed to take a look at the situation. Very shortly thereafter the Binh Dinh
                    provincial senior advisor was removed. I really think I had done a good deed,
                    but my real job was to report on the war which continued at a more restricted
                    level during the cease-fire, and on the political situation and the morale of
                    the people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Qui Nhon?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>MACK: Yes, I was at Qui Nhon which was the capital of Binh Dinh Province, a large
                    province in Central Vietnam. And within a month or two of my arrival, I
                    literally put the last GI on the last boat to leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is Qui Nhon a port?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes Qui Nhon is a big port. It serves as the port for the highland city of
                    Pleiku, for example. So within a month or two all U.S. Forces, all, were gone.
                    And the Vietnamese were very lonely with no Americans around. So since I was
                    there with my wife, all the doors were open to us. There were only a handful of
                    American civilians left, carrying out civilian functions.</p>
                <p>Since, in those days, I was a Vietnamese speaker and knew the area, I was
                    considered an old hand at the ripe old age of 30. I couldn't have had more
                    access than I did. And Sheila and I took advantage of that access and traveled
                    around a lot. The cease-fire had funny rules. The war took place in certain
                    areas but not in other areas. It was fairly predictable. The result was we could
                    get out and around. When we had a day or two off, my wife and I would drive to
                    different place around the country. For example, we drove in our International
                    Scout all the way from Qui Nhon the North Vietnamese border in Quang Tri
                    Province; also from Qui Nhon up to Pleiku and Kon Tum. From Qui Nhon through the
                    mountain vacation town of Da Lat down to Saigon and on to My Tho on the Me Cong
                    River. I would never have attempted this during the war.</p>
                <p>I would get intelligence reports before we would go. I never carried a weapon. My
                    view was for what? What good would that do. And just tried to play it smart when
                    we were on the road. We never had an incident.</p>
                <p>Anyway for my reports on the ceasefire, politics, and attitudes, I would type out
                    my dispatches in my messy style. We did not have word-processor in those days.
                    My wife, who was my unpaid assistant, would then retype them nicely. A plane
                    would come by every afternoon to pick up my “dispatch” and take it to the
                    Consulate General in Nha Trang and the Embassy in Saigon. Just like in the old
                    Foreign Service days, except instead of a ship it was a plane.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>I reported on what I had heard and seen. Whatever skirmish had taken place. How
                    the International Control Commission, which was set up under the Paris Peace
                    Accords to monitor its implementation, was getting along since they had an
                    office in the town. If the North Vietnamese were building roads in the mountains
                    in eyesight of where I was, I could report on that. If there was a prisoner of
                    war exchange, I could report on that. In fact, Sheila and I went to a South
                    Vietnamese/Viet Cong prisoner of war exchange. We probably shouldn't have but
                    did. This is how it happened. At a party, a South Vietnamese Air Force Base
                    commander, at Sheila's prompting, offered to fly us in his Huey helo up to the
                    headquarters of the northernmost district in Binh Dinh. We took him up on his
                    offered and he came through. He flew us up to that town, where he commandeered a
                    jeep, ripped off his name tags so he couldn't' be identified by the VC, and
                    drove us to the exchange site in the middle of nowhere. To get there we had to
                    drive way west of the last outpost of the South Vietnamese Army. It was a very
                    exciting time, probably my best ever six months in the Foreign Service.</p>

                <p>MACK: No! I just covered Qui Nhon, I mean Binh Dinh which was a lowland province.
                    It did contain some mountains, but I just covered the lowland areas. I did drive
                    to other areas, including the highlands, to visit colleagues who had been

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>MACK: Yes. Yes, the final offensive began against the highland provinces. Even in
                    1973 when I was in Binh Dinh the impression was that the North Vietnamese were
                    logistically building up to do something. You could see the roads they were
                    carving out on the mountainside, literally. And in addition, we were cutting
                    back on our logistical support to the South Vietnamese Army. That meant, for
                    example, that a Vietnamese Unit would have a limited amount of gasoline to use
                    in their vehicles. So they were restricted how often they could drive. They were
                    running short on ammunition. They couldn't fire H&amp;I (Harassment and )
                    Interdiction fire as they always had before. They were much more careful about
                    how much ammo they expended. They knew their source of supply was severely
                    reduced. While I was there in 1973, we knew the North Vietnamese were building
                    up, but the South Vietnamese were not expending resources to counter it. It was
                    a very strange situation. Yet in this limbo period, we could move around to many
                    areas freely. These were areas that in my first tour I never would have gone
                    into on the ground or without being accompanied by armed military force. It was
                    kind of a shadow war or a phony war, a kind of a surreal situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your Vietnamese contacts in your area saying?
                        Were they all saying that when something happens will you get me out or that
                        sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: No! No! They were not really saying that. But the Vietnamese military was
                    plainly worried about the drop in US logistical support. When the Americans
                    pulled out, they left their air bases and all the equipment and all the
                    buildings, but clearly the Vietnamese did not have the resources to maintain
                    them. They were restricted in the weapons and the munitions they had available
                    as they were in fuel and parts for vehicles and that sort of thing. They could
                    feel the pinch and I just have to believe that they were feeling lonely and
                    probably wondering if the Americans would come back if the North attacked.</p>
                <p>At the same time, they were extremely warm toward me and to my wife who was
                    teaching English in a normal school in Qui Nhon. They were very, very happy to
                    see Americans. I think they took some comfort in that and the fact that I would
                    be there with my spouse.</p>

                <p>MACK: Maybe you are thinking about the 1972 North Vietnamese frontal assault, the
                    so called “Easter Offensive” down Highway I into the South. I can tell you that
                    Quang Tri City, the first provincial capital they came to, was reduced to
                    rumble. My wife and I visited it in 1973. There were no buildings standing above
                    my height. Literally the whole town was wiped out.</p>

                <p>MACK: During my time, they were not flying out of South Vietnam. They may have
                    been flying out of Thailand. Frankly, I just don't recall.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: My colleagues in the highlands were a little more nervous, I remember, and
                    rightly so. I remember driving up to Kon Tum via Pleiku with my wife unescorted
                    in our not so trusty International Harvester Scout. The first leg of the trip,
                    from Qhi Nhon to Pleiku, was uneventful. That stretch was at one time known as
                    the “the highway of death”. It had been made famous in Bernard Fall's book “
                    Street without Joy” about destruction of the French Army's “Force Mobile” by the
                    Communists during the French Indochina war in the early 50s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Street Without Joy, yeah!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: But in any event, while we were on the highway from Pleiku to Kon Tum we
                    witnessed a series of air strikes about three miles away. We just stopped the
                    car and stood on our own hood and watched. And then that night in Kon Tum the
                    local forces were constantly shelling with artillery North Vietnamese Army
                    targets about ten or fifteen miles from town.. According to my colleague Richard
                    Mueller who was there, that was not an unusual occurrence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were these? Where these to keep people from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: They were North Vietnamese units in the jungles around Kon Tum. The area
                    was not heavily populated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Was South Vietnamese Government corruption a big issue
                        where you were here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Of course. Not in every province, not all the time. Because from time to
                    time you did have honest people who really wanted to clean house and attempted
                    to. But you did have a tradition of corruption and you also had by virtue of the
                    huge U.S. presence a big potential target for local corruption. Qui Nhon City in
                    Binh Dinh Province in II Corps was a major logistical hub. Three divisions — two
                    U.S. and one South Korean — were supported out of the port of Qui Nhon. The
                    opportunity for diversion, whether of fuel, other logistical material or other
                    things like commissary items, was huge. And, therefore, the temptation was
                    enormous. I suppose there was a lot of the same in Europe during World War
                    II..</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I was in Vietnam I ran across someone who had files
                        that went back to World War II that showed there was diversion of gasoline
                        that came through France for our armies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Right. And it was huge in Vietnam too. But while I was there in 1973, the
                    allied forces withdrew and opportunities for graft declined. For example, the
                    gasoline pipeline was not full anymore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But also I was wondering whether you got involved in
                        consular activities? Because when I was Consul General in Saigon we had some

                </p>
                <p>MACK: Oh Gee! I was the head of the Branch Consulate in Da Nang in 1969 but
                    another junior officer handled those issues, and I don't recall any specific
                    incidents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the background of your wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well, she comes from a small town called Pleasantville, which is near my
                    hometown of Rye, New York in Westchester County. I didn't know her growing up. I
                    met her in Washington actually when I was going through Foreign Service A-100
                    course for junior officers in 1966. She was then a Geography teacher at Langley
                    High School in McLean, Virginia. We didn't get married until five years later in
                    1971. From Langley High School, Sheila had gone off to be a VISTA Volunteer on
                    the Navajo Reservation in Arizona. I shipped out to South Vietnam. We got back
                    together 5 years later when I heard she still wasn't married. She was the kind
                    of gal that's good in any kind of situation, obviously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What a wonderful introduction to the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well she probably enjoyed Vietnam as much as any place we have ever been
                    since. Never complained at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you were there six months, how did you feel about the
                        Peace Accords when you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: You are asking me thirty-four years after the event and after all sorts of
                    things have happened which will cloud my memory of what happened and when. I was
                    never convinced that the Paris Peace Accords agreement would lead to elections
                    under conditions acceptable to the North. Real free elections in the North would
                    have been impossible in any event. In the south, the Communists would have lost.
                    But clearly the communists never planned on getting to that point. They were
                    simply waiting for the Americans to leave so that could take South Vietnam by
                    military force. Which, of course they did.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: People get confused. I left there in August of 1973. South Vietnam fell in
                    April or May of '75. There were almost two years between my departure and the
                    fall. So, I'm not one of the guys who were plucked from the roof of the Embassy
                    in that dramatic photograph.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The end came rather quickly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: It came rather quickly but it came in context of the continued reduction of
                    U.S. logistical support and, contrary to the North Vietnamese offensive in 1971,
                    no US air support either. To my knowledge, we provided no air support in final
                    battles in 1975. And by then the South Vietnamese military had been bled down
                    and knew that the Americans were not going to help them this time around. So I
                    think it sapped their will to fight. Some units actually fought very, very well
                    but were simply overwhelmed. But others, particularly in Central Vietnam,
                    crumbled. The fall of the provincial capitals in the highlands turned into rout
                    in the coastal cities as well. People just panicked. Once it started, things
                    collapsed like a house of cards.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: I went back and finished my tour in Costa Rica. And after I finished there
                    I had the opportunity to serve in Brazil. I had always wanted to serve in a
                    Portuguese speaking country so I requested an assignment in Brazil. After
                    Portuguese language training, I was assigned as a Labor Officer at the Consulate
                    General in Sao Paulo.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Costa Rica is always held up as being the golden country
                        of Central America. How did you find it there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well Costa Rica really was an island of democracy, in a sea of
                    dictatorship. It was really an open society. As a political/labor officer I had
                    total assess to almost everybody. And it was a great assignment and a delightful
                    place to live. The climate was ideal in San Jose up on the Meseta Central. Warm
                    in the day and cool at night. There were a lot of things to do on weekends. We
                    liked to hike and did a lot of backpacking. At that point, we had no children so
                    we were basically free to do whatever we wanted.</p>
                <p>That said, the Costa Ricans for years very successfully milked their democratic
                    status with the US. As a result they received economic assistance for much
                    longer and in far greater quantities than their relatively advanced economic
                    level of development justified.</p>

                <p>MACK: Fine! I had just gone through the labor officer training short course,
                    which included orientation sessions at AFL-CIO headquarters in Washington. The
                    AFL-CIO (AIFLD) officer in Costa Rica named Russo was a good guy and we got
                    along very well. He worked with Costa Rica's democratic labor organizations and
                    we really did not have any problems. Remember I was a Junior Officer. I was not
                    making and shaping U.S. policy. Not that we had to make and shape anything in
                    Costa Rica.</p>

                <p>MACK: Yes. United Fruit had a plantation on the Pacific coast and Standard Fruit
                    Company had two on the Caribbean side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the banana workers organized?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes, they were well organized, and if I remember correctly were democratic
                    unions, strong, strong unions. I can't remember any horrible labor strife in the
                    banana zone while I was there. My memory may fail me but the workers there on
                    the average were much more handsomely paid and much better taken carried of then
                    than average rural worker in Costa Rica. I found that was the case in Honduras
                    too by the way. But the United Fruit Company was always a political punching bag
                    because it had gotten involved in local politics in the old days and represented
                    an important part of region's exports. But in Costa Rica in the 70s, they really
                    did not occupy the lions share of the economy. They were not insignificant, but
                    at that time, in addition to bananas, Costa Rica produced coffee, cattle and
                    sugar. Also, bananas were grown on the coasts, not in the central highlands
                    where most the population lived. So, it was not a hostile environment.</p>

                <p>MACK: I left in mid '75, took four or five months of Portuguese language training
                    and at the end of the year went to Sao Paulo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now Sao Paulo, of course is a huge city.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Indeed and the industrial center of Brazil. This was during the military
                    government period. At that point, Gen. Geisel was President. He proved to be a
                    more open-minded leader than some had expected. The Labor movement was
                    ostensibly under government control. But believe me, underneath their control a
                    lot of things were going on. And in any event, basically my job was to maintain
                    relations with the Sao Paulo labor movement, which I did. I spent a lot of time
                    with the labor union leaders and sent a few off to study at the AIL-CIO's
                    “George Meany Institute” outside Washington, etc. I also reported on how the
                    government kept union leaders under control. They had systems for doing this. I
                    won't bore you, but it was very interesting. One of my union contacts was a guy
                    named Ignacio “Lula” da Silva, now president of Brazil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh Yeah!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: While I was in Sao Paulo, Lula had become head of the Metallurgical Workers
                    Union that covered the three satellite cities around Sao Paulo where Brazil's
                    automobile and truck manufacturers were located. Lula's union was probably the
                    strongest and richest in Brazil. We became really pretty good friends. I liked
                    him a lot. I recognized that his union had some strong leftist influence
                    particularly among the lawyers who at that time were often the powers behind the
                    throne of Brazilian unions. And some were members of the Communist Party of
                    Brazil. But Lula was a bright young guy, honest and forward looking. He also was
                    fairly open minded, though obviously being schooled by some of the advisors that
                    I just spoke to you about. Lula and his wife were guests in our home. I also
                    invited Lula to attend the George Meany Institute for a month's training. He had
                    never been out of Brazil and was very excited to have this opportunity. He
                    really could not wait to do this. But a couple of weeks before he was to leave
                    for the US, he phoned me and said, “Jim, I am sorry I just can't make the trip;
                    I have other commitments”. At that point it was clear to me his advisors had
                    told him not to go the United States. Perfectly clear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like these advisors were sort othey represent
                        the left wing intellectuals hanging around. Not really workers but —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Right, they were labor lawyers. But in Brazil, union leaders typically had
                    lawyers to advise them, to write speeches for them etc.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes. So anyway Lula did not go and the rest is history. He became a very
                    successful Labor Leader and then ran for President, I guess twice before winning
                    his third time. And he is turning out to be a very, very attractive pragmatic
                    leader of the left. The US has developed a good relationship with him despite
                    the ideological differences; he has shown his pragmatic side, which was pretty
                    obvious even way back then.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: But he turned out not to be that way at all. Though he is socially very
                    progressive. And he is intent on righting some of the social wrongs in Brazil.
                    And definitely wants to improve the lives of the workers. He also recognized
                    that he couldn't do that by destroying the economy. He needed the support from
                    the industrialists and foreign investors to keep the economy moving. He is
                    acting in a very, very responsible way.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: Sure, but I also was there for a year and a half under Jimmy Carter. I am

                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes there was a little bit of tension there. On the one hand we wanted a
                    return to democracy and an end to Brazil's nuclear program. But on the other
                    hand the labor movement believed that the US had been supportive of the coup
                    d'etat in Brazil in the '60's. So yeah, the union leaders on the left, and some
                    democratic labor leaders would bring that up. On the other hand, some of the
                    unions were sympathetic to the military government would not have been concerned
                    about it. Obviously, students would have been concerned about it and
                    intellectuals. While things were calm on the surface, there were a lot of
                    problems under the surface.</p>

                        the manufacturers as opposed to the workers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>MACK: What the General Geisel wanted was labor peace. And the military had
                    designed a system to keep labor peace. Basically if a labor leader got out of
                    line, he was arrested. The government also controlled the unions by controlling
                    their money. The government imposed a “check off” system by which all workers
                    had union dues automatically deducted form their pay checks. But the money first
                    went to the Government which then turned it back to the unions. So the Unions
                    were quite prosperous. They had nice offices and they had a lot of services for
                    their members but they were totally dependent on the Government for their funds.
                    In most cases the Government was successful in using this approach.</p>
                <p>But some unions, like Lula's metallurgical workers unions, represented workers
                    with a higher level of education and who drew pretty good salaries and good
                    benefits because they worked for multi-national automobile manufacturers like
                    Volkswagen, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors.</p>
                <p>These unions were more assertive but I don't recall any strikes. So, yes, I think
                    the Government basically wanted economic development and social peace and labor
                    peace. And some labor leaders were bought off by the government one way or
                    another. Some were given positions of theoretical influence. Some got out of
                    line and were arrested. Others lost their political rights, they called it
                    casacao. I knew one labor leader who was a democrat, in fact, and a true fighter
                    for labor rights. He was banished to a farm in Paran� State.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: It was an old fashion Communist Party. But this was a clandestine party.
                    The communist party was illegal. Nobody ever said he or she was a communist.
                    These people operated behind the scenes. They whispered and organized but they
                    did not fly the communist flag. They were trying to survive and many I am sure
                    were jailed during that period. They were basically went underground. And some
                    of them were involved with the unions labor lawyers. A couple actually were in
                    Congress. But they were careful.</p>

                        much working your own territory?</hi>

                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>MACK: Well, there was clearly a division of labor but there was no question as to
                    who the boss was. It was John Hugh Crimmins, the Ambassador. Clearly anything
                    dealing with the Federal Government was in the province of our Embassy in
                    Brasilia. The Consulate General in Sao Paulo, under Fred Chapin, a very, very
                    capable and senior officer, was able to report on commercial economic or labor
                    activity in Sao Paulo State, which is saying a lot since Sao Paulo generated a
                    huge proportion of Brazil's economic activity in Brazil. But Embassy clearance
                    was required in some cases. I remember we did prepare a series of cables on the
                    coffee freeze when much of Brazil's coffee trees died causing a tripling of
                    world prices, and producing a windfall for Brazil because it had such huge
                    stocks of coffee, but also produced a lot of unemployment. I also think those
                    coffee freeze cables had to be cleared through the Embassy since in those days
                    coffee was so dominant in the Brazilian economy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: Criminality existed but not on the scale that I understand exists today. I
                    never really felt threatened there when my wife and I went out at night. I do
                    recall that there started to be some armed holdups in homes of people we knew.
                    But it wasn't something that made people not dare walk down the street. I jogged
                    every day, and I walked a lot. Sometimes I walked to work. I never was
                    threatened and I don't think I was ever robbed. Obviously things got a lot

                    was an AFL-CIO representative anywhere in Brazil. It would have been unlikely
                    during the military regime. However, the Embassy Labor Attache, Jim Shea was
                    formerly with the Amalgamated Meat Packers Union and had the complete confidence
                    of the AFL-CIO. Jim was very close to the unions with which the AFL-CIO had
                    historic ties. Of course Jim was not there to organize. However, he would have
                    sent labor leaders to the US for training, as I tried to do with Lula.</p>

                    Keep in mind the military put a lid on a lot of overt labor organization
                    activities. I mean the unions had quite good physical infrastructure - buildings

                        Leaders do well by themselves and not as much for the rank and files.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I told you the military government had put a lid on the labor movement. The
                    structure was all there. The physical structure was definitely there. The
                    Government saw to it that the unions had money and could provide certain kinds
                    of services for their members. Union leaders who played the game could live
                    comfortably. But I don't remember their living in absolute luxury.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I went to the Azores Islands, a semi-autonomous region of Portugal as
                    consul. I had wanted to be assigned to another Portuguese speaking country, and
                    after all these years in the Foreign Service, I wanted to run something myself.
                    The US Foreign Service is not the US Army. There are not many opportunities to
                    be the equivalent of a platoon leader in your earlier years. I actually applied
                    for various autonomous consular posts. Not many exist any more. But I was
                    accepted and assigned as consul to the US Consulate in Ponta Delgada on the
                    island of Sao Miguel, with responsibilities for the entire archipelago. It was a
                    two officer post. Myself and a Junior Officer, plus 14 Foreign Service National
                    Employees. We were basically an immigrant visa issuing post. And most of our
                    clients ended up in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. It was a delightful respite
                    from the real world, poor but breathtakingly beautiful. A fairyland . On the
                    other hand, you don't go to the Azores to go to the beach. While it never
                    freezes at sea level, there are a lot of Atlantic storms. A few amateur sailors
                    come through, and the occasional naval vessel and cruise ship.</p>

                <p>MACK: I was there from '77 to '79.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the base negotiations with the Portuguese go. I
                        mean our whole Portuguese policy revolves around the Azores?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well, it did in the cold war days, definitely. We ran our anti-Soviet
                    submarine detection operations our of the Lajes base on Terceira island. Also,
                    during the 1973 mid-east war, we sent our military resupply flights to Israel
                    through Lajes, where we had base rights, since the Europeans would not allow us
                    to refuel on the continent.</p>
                <p>There also was a fairly strong Azorean independence movement at that time. The
                    reason was at the time of the Portuguese revolution, in I think 1972, the
                    communists in mainland Portugal quickly came to dominate most of the posts in
                    the government and fully expected to win elections which took place in 1976.
                    Most of the people of the Azores were very, very conservative and wanted nothing
                    to do with communism. We are talking about islands of basically poor peasants
                    with a few rich landowners, plus poor fishermen. Most of the poor majority were
                    linked emotionally and by blood ties of their emigrant relatives to the United
                    States.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Every Azorean, and I mean every Azorean, had a close relative in the United
                    States. And most of them wanted to go to the United States. And very few of them
                    had any ties at all with men in Portugal. Only the rich did. And the rich sent
                    their children to university in Portugal where many became leftists. The poor
                    sent their children to America where they became red, white and blue Americans.
                    Ha! Ha!</p>
                <p>As Portugal was drifting far to the left, a movement grew up in the Azores
                    advocating Azorean independence and membership in NATO. You probably recall
                    there was a period when Kissinger made a decision, a U.S. Government decision,
                    to support the Portuguese Socialist party, which was democratic, against the
                    communists, rather than to give up on Portugal and let it become communist to
                    serve as a lesson for the rest of Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've interviewed Frank Carlucci.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: He was the Ambassador part of the time I was there. There had been a US
                    policy debate on whether to let Portugal go communist and go down the tubes just
                    to teach the rest of left leaning Europe a lesson. Or whether we should urge the
                    Europeans, particularly those with socialist governments like Germany, to
                    support democracy in Portugal and the Portuguese Socialist Party against the
                    communists. The Communists in Portugal made a huge strategic error, just as they
                    later did in Nicaragua, by agreeing to free elections. They were totally
                    convinced that since they controlled the streets, the labor movement, the
                    universities and the press, they would win a free election.</p>
                <p>What they did not realize was that even though they did dominate the labor
                    movement, the student movement and the media and intellectuals class, when it
                    came to counting votes, the politically conservative small property owners, the
                    small farmers in northern Portugal, would overwhelming vote against the
                    Communists. The Communists ended up winning outright only 12 % of the vote and
                    about 18% with their allied parties. It was amazing. They owned the streets of
                    Lisbon. But when the votes were counted they were blown away. So by the time I
                    got to the Azores, which was in '77, Mario Soares, a Socialist, was Prime
                    Minister, and General Eanes, a conservative was President. US policy was to
                    support the Soares socialist government. My instructions were to have nothing to
                    do with the Azorean Independence movement. But, I did have a little problem; the
                    senior FSN in my consular section was one of the leaders of the Azorean
                    independence movement. So it was an awkward situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way I would think that the Azoreans as a group didn't
                        not really think their islands had a chance of becoming an independent
                        country.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>MACK: Well, I can't answer that question. I do not know. But there are a lot of
                    smaller island states. Look at the Caribbean. They were a quarter of a million
                    of people in the Azores. There are probably eight countries in the Caribbean
                    that don't have the size or population of the Azores. There are a lot of
                    microstates that have strategic importance .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: To counteract the Azorean independence movement, the Portuguese government
                    agreed to grant the Azores a rather considerable amount of autonomy. The Azorean
                    autonomous region has an elected assembly and president. They received a large
                    proportion of the payments that the US makes for its Lajes base rights. That,
                    and the defeat of the communists on the mainland, took the wind out of the sails
                    of the independence movement. I have not been back since I left in 1979 so
                    cannot tell you how things are now, but I do think that the fires of
                    independence are long out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This Lajes base rights thing seems like a running
                        bargaining situation which has gone on forever. Either you just completed a
                        treaty and you start the new process.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I frankly have not followed this situation through years and I don't know
                    what the status of the U.S. facility is currently. We are talking really about
                    the use of a Portuguese base since Lajes is not a U.S. base per se. It is
                    Portuguese base at which we have use rights. There actually was a Portuguese
                    side of the base and an American side of the base. I have no idea how extensive
                    the US installations are now; how many Americans are still there? In my time,
                    there were probably well over a thousand uniformed US military and maybe a total
                    of three thousand Americans there if you include including families, and there
                    were a lot of families. It was not an inconsequential number. The US facility
                    was commanded an USAF Brigadier General.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it at the same Island you were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: No it was a different island.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in a way, I would think it would be a little hard to go
                        from Island to Island?</hi>

                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>MACK: Well you flew. That is how we got there. You take a commercial airplane
                    flight, which was sometimes very exciting in winter or the middle of a storm.
                    The turbo prop plane was solidly built. I had some frightening moments but I
                    never had to take a drink in the ocean. And we would fly over to the base about
                    once a month. I had an excellent relationship with the people at the base. They
                    were happy to see us and were very supportive. My wife, in fact, got a Master's
                    Degree in Public Administration through a university extension program at the
                    base. She would go over there for two weeks every three months. Anyway, we had
                    close relationship with the people at the base, including the commander of the
                    US facility. Also, I was a member of the San Miguel Island tennis team, and so I
                    organized tournaments against the American Base. They would come over to San
                    Miguel with their families and we would go over there. It was a lot of fun.
                    Everybody had a good time. It was very enjoyable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It didn't leave much chance for the troops to get in

                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well, I don't think there was a whole lot of trouble. First of all, a lot
                    of US military people were accompanied by their families. There were USAF, Navy
                    (P-3s flew out of Lajes) and a small US Army contingent. I think the military
                    favored families. They wanted a stabile environment at this isolated
                    facility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was not a fighter base or something of that
                        nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: No. It was a logistics support base that supported USAF aircraft coming
                    through, and a home base for Navy P-3s tracking Soviet nuclear submarines. Ponta
                    Delgada was a good post for a family with very young children. Our kids were
                    very young at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many children did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well we got there with two and we adopted a third while were there. So we
                    had three, all very young, all under four.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well, I, or I should say my vice consul and I were doing Consular
                    wornon-immigrant and immigrant visa work, provided support to US military ships
                    that would come in. Lots of commercial and private vessels would stop there
                    also. We would have seaman issues. Strange Americans would wash up there and we
                    would have to deal with them. I also did some political reporting and
                    representation.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a lot of Portuguese Americans coming back
                        from Massachusetts or Rhode Island?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Absolutely! Absolutely! We even had the Archbishop of Boston at the time,
                    Cardinal Medeiros, who was born in the Azores and emigrated to the US at the age
                    of fifteen.</p>
                <p>The Feast Day of Santo Cristo and the whole population turns out, many
                    participate in the procession to demonstrate their faith and make and keep
                    promises in exchange for God'. The streets become basically flowerbeds. People
                    made pave the streets as if a giant carpet in different designs made of flower
                    petals. Mostly they use azaleas of different colors (the Festa is in April) and
                    lilies, both of which grow in great profusion in the Azores. It was absolutely
                    breathtakingly beautiful. Archbishop Medeiros had been ordained as Boston's
                    first Cardinal not of Irish ancestry shortly before. So his participation in the
                    Festa do Santo Cristo made that year's event even bigger. The Azores had many
                    native sons return to visit, but never as a Cardinal.</p>

                    a big reception for him in his honor. We also had a Congresswoman from
                    Massachusetts, a Republican actually, who was there at the same time. So it was
                    quite an affair. Everybody who was anybody was there. It was just wonderful a
                    wonderful time.</p>

                <p>But the Azores were kind of a fairyland, a whole different world. We really were
                    isolated there. But, people were very good to us and we got around to see all
                    the islands and that was part of my job. People were happy to see me. There were
                    lots of consular issues to deal with because of the large number of immigrants
                    to the US, returnees to the Azores, ship visits, adoptions etc. .</p>

                <p>MACK: Immigration was pretty straightforward. The immigrants were family members
                    being called by relatives already in the US. The frauds were the marriages, like
                    a 23 year old Azorean guy marrying a fifty-five year old non-Portuguese speaking
                    American woman; that kind of thing. We also did thirty or so adoptions a year
                    including my own.</p>

                <p>MACK: You are very good at this Stu. Yes, in fact, they did but they would come
                    into mostly another island, Faial at a town called Horta which had a gorgeous
                    natural harbor. Faial was part of archipelago with three big islands Sao Jorge,
                    Faial and Pico. These islands were quite close, probably no more than 10 miles
                    apart and easily visible from one another. The sea between them was protected
                    and quite calm. It was a great place for Trans-Atlantic yachts to stop so if I
                    happened to be in Faial I would certainly go down to the harbor in Horta to see
                    what was going on. I remember I did get a ride on a yacht one time in San Miguel
                    a US yachtsman took me out for a few hours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Horta in Faial was where the Alabama came in
                        during the civil war put the guns on board or something before it started
                        its cruise under the confederate flag.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Is that right?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It came out of Liverpool without guns and all. This is
                        part of the Laird ram it was called and it was met at Faial where it took on
                        its armament. This was to try to get around the union blockade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Faial was quite a bustling place a hundred years ago. And we actually had a
                    consulate there for many years because of its importance as a whaling center.
                    The population then was much greater than now. Then they had a horrible volcanic
                    eruption in the late 1950s, I think 1957, that destroyed a large part of the
                    island. Shortly thereafter, the US Congress passed some special legislation
                    allowing any resident of Faial to immigrate to the US. About two-thirds of them
                    did. That is that main reason the population went from 30,000 to about 12,000 in
                    period of twenty years. During the late 50s and 60s, the US Consulate in Ponta
                    Delgada on Sao Miguel, which processed immigrants from all of the islands, was
                    issuing immigration visas to 12,000 Azorean immigrants a year. That meant the
                    consulate for a time was the seventh largest immigrant visa issuing post in the
                    world. Can you imagine!</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Well the result of all this out migration from the Azores was that the total
                    population in islands had dropped from about 440,000 in 1920 to about 250,000
                    when I was there from 1977-79. The number is probably less today. And the island
                    of Faial itself was a beautiful but sad place because it was half abandoned,
                    with homes boarded up and collapsing. Even in the main city of Horta which is
                    nicely laid out along a curved bay there were a lot of abandoned houses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How heavy was the hand of the Embassy in Lisbon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Not very heavy. My only explicit orders were that I was to have no truck
                    with the Azorean Independence Movement and to maintain good relations with the
                    leadership of the US military installations at Lajes airbase on Terceira Island.
                    I complied with both instructions. The first order was a bit more tricky
                    proposition because my senior local employee was active in the independence
                    movement, and an American citizen who had purchased farm there and lived here
                    with his family was connected to the movement and his wife was good friends of
                    my vice consul's wife. Sao Miguel was a small place. The second instruction was
                    easy since there were great folks at the base who treated us extremely well. I
                    think I had two or US Ambassadorial visits the whole time I was there. Every
                    four months, I would travel to Lisbon and report in to the Embassy there, but
                    really, the folks in the American Embassy in Lisbon had a lot of other more
                    important things to worry about other than the US Consulate in Sao Miguel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't they worry about the negotiations for renewal of
                        our Azorean base rights?.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes, but I was not involved in those negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was done by the lawyers of the Pentagon and the State
                        Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Right. So the bottom line was that I didn't cause problems for Ambassador
                    Frank Carlucci or Ambassador Bloomfield. I drafted and sent my dispatches to
                    them. When I was in Lisbon, Ambassador Carlucci would invite me to play tennis
                    with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it kept you reporting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well, it sure did. And I found drafting my reports a lot easier than
                    encrypting them, which I had to do when my vice consul was on leave. Sao Miguel
                    turned out to be a good post for a young family with kids below school age. It
                    was a good assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is probably a good place to stop! You put it
                        at the end here. You left there in '79 and where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: '79 I was assigned back to the Department of the State. Where I became the
                    Guatemala/Belize Desk Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Okay we will pick this up in '79 in Guatemala.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is the 12th of September 2005. Jim you are the Guatemala Desk Officer?</p>
                <p>MACK: Yes, I was the Guatemalan /Belize Desk Officer so I covered both countries.
                    The reason for this was that at the time there was, and I believe still is, is a
                    serious border dispute between the two countries. In fact, at one time Guatemala
                    claimed all of Belize, which in 1979 was still a British colony. I think the
                    Guatemalans have since reduced their claim but it is still rather substantial.
                    Anyway that was the big issue at the time I was on the desk. The British were
                    anxious to unburden themselves of Belize, which was one of the few remaining
                    British colonies in the Caribbean at that point. Also, important in their
                    thinking was the cost of maintaining defense of the colony. Because of the ever
                    present threat of a Guatemalan incursion they had to keep a couple of thousand
                    troops in Belize, including a unit of Harrier jump jets, which was an expensive
                    proposition to them. At the same time, they worried, as did the elected
                    internally self-governing Belizean government of George Price, that a grant of
                    independence without a border settlement could provoke a Guatemalan invasion. So
                    they were stuck.</p>
                <p>In any event the border issue consumed a significant amount of my time as a desk
                    officer. During this period, I worked very closely with guy named Millard Burr
                    from the State Department Office of The Geographer. Burr came up with the
                    proposal to guarantee Guatemala sovereign access to the Caribbean sea from their
                    main port of Puerto Barrios. The problem was that without an agreement, while
                    ships did enjoy physical access to Puerto Barrios in accordance with the
                    international law of the sea, it was not the sovereign access that Guatemala
                    felt it had to have for political reasons. So when we received word that the
                    Guatemalan dictator might be willing to cut a deal, Burr came up with the idea
                    of granting the Guatemalans a mile wide sovereign channel through Belizean
                    waters to Puerto Barrios. The problem we had to solve was that smack in the
                    middle of the proposed sovereign channel were several very small islets called
                    the Sapodilla keys, which belonged to Belize. We knew that George Price was
                    adamant against giving up an inch of territory, so Burr came up with the idea of
                    granting Guatemala usufruct of the islands in perpetuity which would allow
                    Guatemalan to claim it had won sovereign access to the sea.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Now usufruct is a word I had never heard before, but exists in international law,
                    It means use as if it were sovereign. For Belize that meant they would retain
                    theoretical sovereignty, but Guatemala would get to use them as if it were the
                    sovereign owner. We though this was a brilliant solution that would acceptable
                    to everybody, end the dispute, allow Belize to peacefully achieve independence
                    and win us the Nobel Peace Prize. Just kidding but we were very excited.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the problem ended up not being the Guatemalan dictator president
                    and notorious human right abuser Gen Lucas Garcia , but the democratically
                    elected Belizean Prime Minister George Price. Price was adamant that he wasn't
                    going to agree to any deal that as much as implied loss of any sovereign
                    territory even some water and a few islets. And so, Price lost the opportunity
                    to settle the deal then and there. The British were pushing Price very hard to
                    accept.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering why we were making a deal or acting as
                        though we were outside authority. Why weren't the British doing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Oh the British were very actively involved. Lord Carrington was very, very
                    involved in this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a Foreign Minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: He was the head of the FCO, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office at the
                    time. He was very, very active in the process and the British dearly wanted to
                    get out. I am sure I am missing some details twenty-six years later. But that
                    occupied a lot of time. My other important issue as desk officer was Guatemala's
                    horrendous human rights record under the military dictatorship, which was waging
                    a war without quarter with Marxist guerrilla group.</p>
                <p>Thousands of people were killed in the rural areas were the insurgency raged. In
                    the urban areas, hundreds were gunned down by Lucas Garcia's people working from
                    death lists which it was my understanding he personally approved, kind of like
                    the evil Ming the Merciless in the Buck Rogers movies. It was pretty awful. Not
                    that we could do too much about it since the US already had cut Guatemala off
                    from military assistance a long time before. Remember this was under the Carter
                    Administration. But what this also meant was with no US assistance, we could not
                    use the threat to cut it off as a lever to force greater respect for human
                    rights, although I'm not sure that Guatemalan government would have been
                    susceptible to pressure in any event. They had decided to fight the insurgency,
                    and any suspected of supporting it, their way, which was brutally. In some ways
                    they were successful. Not that they are better off today because for it. In fact
                    a lot of the lawlessness, high level corruption and impunity in Guatemala today
                    can be traced to that period.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>In any event, all this was happening in the context of Central America going down
                    the tubes. Remember, the Sandinistas come into power in '79 or '80 in Nicaragua.
                    The insurgents were rapidly gaining strength in El Salvador. The Chichoneros
                    were growing in Honduras. These were not the most happy times to work in the
                    Office of Central American Affairs. And the nights were very long. We were
                    seriously understaffed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now who were the Guatemalans dictator and his crew
                        killing. Were they basically Indians or were they people who had gotten in
                        his way, or were they unidentifiable group that was fighting him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: In the rural areas anybody who was perceived to give aid and comfort to the
                    guerrilla was a target. I didn't have much access to what was going on. The
                    Embassy could not travel to the worst areas because of security reasons. I
                    really didn't know much unless an American or a missionary living there got
                    caught up in it. In urban areas however they were going after anyone perceived
                    to opposed his regime. Those killed were not necessarily communists at all. They
                    may have been labor union leaders or democrats. I am sure there were some
                    communists among them. I had some contact with the people that the dictator was
                    going after when they would come to Washington. This included a Vinicio Cerezo
                    who later became President. But he was certainly no communist at all. He
                    survived a number of assassination attempts and so anybody who was opposed to
                    the dictator seemed to be fair game for Lucas Garcia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, this during the Carter Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes, and Carter was going full bore on the whole issue of Human Rights. So
                    here we are in 1979 in a situation in which on the one hand the leftist
                    insurgencies in Central America were rapidly gaining ground, and on the other
                    President Carter's Human Rights policies were coming on strong. The State
                    Department was kind of caught in a bind. On one hand, obviously we didn't want
                    to see all those governments in Central America be taken over by leftist
                    guerrillas. On the other hand, we wanted to carry out the Human Rights policy.
                    In the case of Guatemala, we did not have a friendly government to support. In
                    fact, they did not want anything to do with us. They were not receiving any
                    military assistance from us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they picking up any support from the Righthe Jesse
                        Helms types and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I don't recall that in case of Guatemala. I just don't recall. I can recall
                    very vividly El Salvador but I cannot recall the case of Guatemala.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, did you get caught up in the rest of that. The El
                        Salvador and Nicaragua business.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>MACK: Well we all worked in the same office. And we were all overworked in the
                    same office. Central America was staffed at a level for the sleepy old Central
                    America days. A total of seven officers covered Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras,
                    El Salvador, Guatemala and Belize. To give you an idea of the work load, after I
                    left, that office grew to nineteen. Our Deputy was Rich Brown, who passed away a
                    couple of years ago. To say Rich was a very hard working guy was an under
                    statement, and he expected the rest of us to emulate him. Just to give you an
                    idea, when someone left before seven p.m., Rich would comment wryly that that
                    person was “taking the afternoon off”. The fact is that most of us habitually
                    left work a lot later than that which put a lot of strain on those of us who
                    were married with kids, which was practically all of us. We really began to
                    worry about people there. They were wearing. A few years later, the deputy
                    office of Central America Affairs died of a heart attack.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anything happening in Belize from your
                        perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Our focus was to bring the Belizeans and Guatemalans together to resolve
                    the boundary dispute to allow Belize to become independent. That really
                    dominated everything. At that point, George Price had been Prime Minister of
                    that self governing colony for many years and he wanted to be the leader who
                    took Belize to independence. He eventually did, but independence was delayed for
                    a number of years because of the border issue . I cannot recall what year, but
                    it was several years after I left the desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have a Consulate General in Belize at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes, we had a small Consulate General and interesting people assigned
                    there. The consulate had been there for one hundred and fifty years. It was
                    located in an old wooden building that had been shipped down piece by piece from
                    New England and erected in Georgetown. It was made of pine, a pretty old
                    building. I think it had been painted so many times over the years that by 1980
                    I think the paint was thicker than what the termites had left of the wood. The
                    standard joke was that the building was being held up by one hundred coats of
                    paint. It definitely was not a secure building and it was a firetrap. I don't
                    know if they are still in it today.</p>

                <p>MACK: Frank Ortiz, he just passed away. He was in Guatemala at the time that I
                    was there. He had a very difficult job given our terrible relations with the
                    government, the human rights violations, the insurgency etc.</p>

                <p>MACK: The security was awful. And there was a lot of killing going on. The
                    leftists were active too and they were carrying out assassinations. It was a
                    very, very nasty situation.</p>

                <p>MACK: No. I mean there was certainly major change when Reagan came in but
                    remember the Republicans did not control the Congress. So the Carter Human
                    Rights legislation stayed in place. We still had to abide by the law. But the
                    Carter Political Appointees who had wielded tremendous influence, who staffed
                    the powerful Bureau of Human Rights, which had grown to wield an enormous amount
                    of power and practically had veto power of any policy initiative proposed by the
                    careerists working on Central America, were gone.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: We just couldn't do very much with Guatemala because of the human rights
                    problems. It was a very difficult place to work. The country was in the midst of
                    a very serious insurgency and a large part of the country was closed for casual
                    travel; lets put it that way. The government was organizing the rural indigenous
                    population in the highlands into local militias to defend their villages against
                    the insurgents. This turned out to be a rather effective program. But these
                    groups also carried out their own vendettas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do that for two years?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>MACK: Did that for two years. Then I changed jobs and became the Head of Labor/
                    Management Division of the Department, which meant that my job was to negotiate
                    collective bargaining agreements with the two unions representing Department of
                    State employees. One was the American Foreign Service Association for FSOs at
                    State. The other was a Local 1812 of the American Federation of Government
                    Employees (AFGE), which represented FSOs and civil servants at the then USIA.
                    AFSA was a professional organization trying to act like a union. AFGE was a real
                    union, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO. Both AFSA and AFGE had won elections
                    establishing them as representing their bargaining units. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your position was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I represented management in collective bargaining with AFSA and AFGE on how
                    the reforms of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 were to be implemented. That act
                    contained some new benefits so for the first time there was something really to
                    discuss. That is what I spent most of my time doing.</p>
                <p>Keep in mind that in the Federal Government unions cannot negotiate over wages,
                    which are the prerogative of Congress. You may recall that the Air Traffic
                    Controllers learned this the hard way in the early Reagan years. But unions
                    could negotiate over working conditions and implementation of benefits provided
                    by law. For example, the Foreign Service Act of 1980 provided that an employee
                    traveling to or leaving a post could request an advance of a certain number of
                    months pay, for example, to buy a car. We negotiated agreements covering how
                    long an employee would have to pay it back — interest free by the way. It is
                    amazing how much time people can negotiate over the side issues when they are
                    not allowed to negotiate over the main one, salaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I guess, welcome to the world of academia, I
                        guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: So that is what I did. I actually found it interesting. I had been a Labor
                    Officer before but always worked overseas and from the perspective of the union,
                    not the employer. I had never worked the issue within the Department of State. I
                    found it very interesting to do that. When you represent management, you
                    represent the bad guy in the minds of the employees. Sometimes the discussions
                    in my Department contract negotiations became rather heated. But, at any rate, I
                    did that for a couple of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the difference in culture or outlook between
                        the AFGE, which is The American Federation of Government Employees and The
                        American Foreign Service Association?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>MACK: Yes, AFGE, at least on the surface, operated like a real union, which it
                    was though they were very frustrated on the limits of what they could bargain
                    over. The young woman who was the lawyer for Local 1812 saw things in terms of
                    class warfare and comported herself accordingly. But the Foreign Service
                    Association had always seen itself as a professional organization, rather than a
                    union. They too got fairly frisky in negotiations, but my relations with them
                    were more cordial. I had been a member of AFSA until I took that job, but had to
                    resign my membership while in my position representing management. There were
                    those in ASFA who just couldn't see themselves as a labor union. They saw
                    themselves as professionals. On the other hand, AFGE had no illusions as to who
                    they were. They thought they were a serious labor union. And in those days the
                    AFL-CIO unions were losing members very quickly, except in the public sector
                    where they were organizing like crazy. Eventually AFGE came to dominate public
                    sector employees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember the argument at the time. We were suppose to
                        choose if we wanted to join AFGE , a real union affiliated to the AFL-CIO or
                        AFSA. But our problems were so different from regular labor union things,
                        you know. Housing allowances, how to ship goods and all of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Right but a housing allowance per se was not negotiable. However, the
                    procedures on how it was implemented and administered were negotiable. Some of
                    the benefits were useful. Although I am not sure they justified amount of staff
                    time and money devoted to their negotiation. It was quite a learning experience
                    for me as I had had no previous labor negotiations experience. And eventually
                    when I left, they actually went out and hired a professional labor negotiator
                    with the civil service to replace me. That made more sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your boss?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: My supervisor was Jack Collins, a wonderful guy. We are still in contact
                    with him. A very human person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find in your labor negotiations there was an
                        attitude of “let's see if we can find a solution” or was it let's hold

                </p>
                <p>MACK: On whose part?</p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: Sure, my attitude was let's work this out, let's find a solution. Obviously
                    I had some limits to what I could agree to. I didn't just free wheel.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: Right, AFGE managed to get the bargaining unit at USIA to include both
                    civil service and Foreign Service employees and defeated AFSA in a
                    representation election. When I was negotiating with both AFGE and AFSA at the
                    table, negotiations often got much more confrontational.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well, in 1983 I was asked for the second time whether I would be willing to
                    serve in El Salvador as political counselor. The first time I was asked, San
                    Salvador was a non-accompanied post and I had then three little kids at ages
                    four, three and one. As interested as I was in the job from the professional
                    point of view, I was not going to volunteer for a job that would separate me
                    from my family.</p>
                <p>The person who had asked me to go was Ted Briggs, then Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    in ARA. Nineteen months later came back to me to tell me that San Salvador was
                    being reopened for families, and asked if I would take the job. Under those
                    circumstances I could not say no. So in April 1983 my wife and I became the
                    first family with kids allowed to live in El Salvador. Our arrival at the
                    Embassy turned out to be quite an emotional experience for all of us. When we
                    walked through the door the local FSN staff was so excited to see an American
                    family with kids that they broke out in applause. They had interpreted our
                    presence as being positive sign for the outlook of the country. In fact, as I
                    soon realized, the situation in the country was still deteriorating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My God!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: The Embassy had been without families for eighteen months. Of course, in
                    that atmosphere, a kind of macho kind of culture had developed in the Embassy.
                    Everybody was single, divorced or separated. Work hard, party hard. I had seen
                    it in Vietnam. Over time more and more families came back which changed
                    things.</p>

                <p>MACK: Well Dean Hinton was the Ambassador when I arrived in April 1983. He left
                    post three months. Tom Pickering arrived in the summer of 1986.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in El Salvador when you got there
                        in '83?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: When I got there in April the situation on the ground was terrible and
                    getting worse. I remember having a kind of heart to heart talk one weekend with
                    an Agency Officer who had been there a while and whose opinion that I respected.
                    His view was that if things continued the way that they were, with the
                    government losing a battalion every month to the guerrillas, the insurgency
                    would win a military victory some time in 1984. This is a true story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it that the guerillas were that effective, or was it
                        that the army was so ineffective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Probably a combination of both. The Army as it was then constituted just
                    could not deal with the guerillas. The guerrillas were much more nimble. They
                    used hit and run tactics very, very well. They carefully chose their ground,
                    where to fight, where to attack. The Army was kind of a parade Army and they
                    just couldn't deal with guerrillas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As political counselor, what did you find was happening
                        with the populace?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>MACK: Well for one thing, right wing death squads were killing more than 800
                    people a month. The Left was killing people too but not at that rate. You may
                    recall that under Carter, the Congress of the United States had passed an
                    amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act which prohibited the provision of
                    military assistance to governments which were judged to be engaged in patterns
                    of gross violations of the human rights of their population. With respect to El
                    Salvador, that had the practical effect of severely limiting the amount of
                    military assistance we could provide. And it was very, very clear to us that
                    unless the U.S. Government could provide substantial military assistance to El
                    Salvador, like training, equipment and munitions, that the Government could not
                    sustain itself over a period of time. I told you before that, that was the
                    impression of one guy I talked to early in my tour. That became my impression in
                    those first few months. It was just bad news following bad news. Military
                    setbacks and horrendous human rights violations.</p>
                <p>Elements of the Army and their friends felt they could deal with the insurgency
                    by grabbing people in urban areas suspected of supporting the guerrillas and
                    executing them. They couldn't deal with the guerillas in the countryside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did Dean Hilton operate in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Dean was a good friend, but left post within about two or three months or
                    so of my arrival. He was a very, very strong leader, impatient with incompetence
                    and those who he perceived were not pulling their weight. He was a very, very
                    astute political observer. Had very few resources to work with because the
                    terrible state of human rights in the country made it impossible for the U.S. to
                    provide much assistance to the Salvadoran government. He was trying to help
                    Alvaro Magana the interim President, who was a basically decent man. But against
                    the background of all these death squad killings and military defeats, he was
                    very limited in what he could do in 1983.</p>
                <p>So, what happened was after several months or so at post, it was late summer,
                    about four or five us in our section got together to talk over what we could do
                    about this situation. Our judgment was that the Salvadoran Government was losing
                    the war. Yet given the terrible human rights situation with people in the
                    Salvadoran military linked to death squad activity, the U.S. Congress was not
                    going to provide any assistance. But without it, the war was lost.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>We asked ourselves what we could do to change the equation? One of my officers
                    named Felix Vargas had actually written a paper to get the folks in the
                    political section talking. The idea we came up with was for the Administration
                    to send down a very high ranking person, someone with credibility with the
                    Salvadoran military, to read the military the riot act. To tell them “look!. We
                    can help out but only if you do certain things and which included, obviously,
                    getting the death squads under control and reducing the death squad killings
                    dramatically. But we did not think that alone would be enough to justify US
                    assistance and turn things around. The Salvadorans also would have to make major
                    reforms in Army command structure as well and get rid of certain people. We
                    kicked that idea around, polished it up and a month or so after Ambassador
                    Pickering came to post, presented the proposal to him. He thanked us and we
                    didn't hear anything for awhile. I don't know if I should say this on tape?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Put it on tape and then you can always look at it
                        later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: First of all I have to tell you that I have tremendous respect for
                    Ambassador Pickering. He has been a mentor and a great friend and an awesome
                    person who served his country very well in many, many ways. I worked for him
                    twice. In any event about one month after we had made our proposal, he called me
                    up to his office and he said, “Jim!” You have betrayed me.” Those were
                    essentially his words. I was crestfallen because I idolized him. He told me that
                    someone in my section had violated a confidence. Someone had leaked the document
                    that we had given him, or at least the ideas in the document, to the press. It
                    was clear that he had taken our proposal to heart and had planned to turn it
                    into a proposal to send to Washington. I went back and to tell my troops, all
                    whom had been working like crazy, all of whom were totally loyal to Pickering,
                    what had happened. I felt quite strongly that nobody in our section would leak
                    the contents of this document since that would guarantee that nothing would come
                    of our proposal. To leak it would have undermined its impact and made the
                    Salvadorans much less likely to react in the way we wanted.</p>
                <p>Right after that episode we asked for a meeting with Pickering and told him that
                    we had not leaked the document. That was that! He just said, the proposal was
                    over. He essentially led us to believe that the proposal was dead and would not
                    go forward. We were all about ready to submit our resignations because we were
                    so upset at what happened. We felt that if we did not have the confidence of the
                    Ambassador, the section could not operate with the personnel it had on board.
                    Keep in mind ours was a very active political section. We were not just reading
                    newspapers. We were out on the street, all over the country talking to people,
                    taking the human rights message to every actor we had access to. All of us had
                    scarified a lot to take this job. American Embassy San Salvador was not your
                    casual assignment. Ambassador Pickering did not want us to resign but said no
                    more about the incident.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>About a month later as he was about to leave on a trip to Washington, he called
                    me in and asked me to ride with him to the airport. En route he handed me a
                    paper and asked me to read it. Basically it was a cable proposing what
                    essentially what we had proposed to him. His gesture was his way of saying “you
                    have regained my confidence.”</p>
                <p>About a month later, I think it was December, 1983, Vice President George Bush,
                    Sr. came to San Salvador on as head of the high level mission we had proposed
                    earlier to meet with the entire Salvadoran high command, all of the senior
                    colonels and President Magana at the President's residence. I was the notetaker.
                    Bush told them that the US wanted to help El Salvador but could not under
                    current circumstances. Congress would not allow it. He delivered the message on
                    human rights, and without accusing them directly, not scolding them, but as a
                    friend of el Salvador who wanted to help but also wanted them to understand some
                    political realities in the US and some organizational realities in their own
                    armed forces. He said that death squad killings had to end and that the military
                    command structure had to be reformed. Following his visit there was an immediate
                    and precipitous drop in death squad murders from almost 800 a month to almost
                    nothing. In fact, the drop probably started before he got there because the
                    Ambassador had told the Salvadoran high command in advance what message the Vice
                    President was bringing. So the Salvadorans were leaning forward by the time he
                    got there. And the number of death squad killing remained very low for the rest
                    of the time I was in El Salvador. That changes, plus the reforms in the
                    military, together with, I have to add, Ambassador Pickering's very persuasive
                    lobbying of Members of the US Congress during their frequent visits, convinced
                    the Congress to dramatically increase military assistance.</p>
                <p>Let me say something about CODELs. In my first 18 months at post we had 80
                    CODELs, 80. Not 80 Members, but 80 CODELs. The political section was in charge
                    of scheduling CODEL agendas and reporting on their visits. We had a guy who did
                    nothing but organize CODELs. We all shared the task of taking them to meetings
                    with Salvadorans and translating. I would say that a quarter of the Congress
                    came to El Salvador at least during my three years there. I am talking about
                    CODELs as large as 14, which is a huge number to handle. Many came on weekends
                    since it was so easy to get there from Washington, tough on us but we did have
                    an excellent opportunity to explain our case on what was happening. As an aside
                    I should tell you that we would frequently brief the CODELs an my house, which
                    means we had to feed them and their accompanying staffs. But since only
                    Americans were present for those briefings, that also meant we were not allowed
                    to claim those meals as representational expenses. Once my wife pointed this out
                    to a CODEL and the rule or law was changed.</p>
                <p>And the fact was that things began to improve in early 1984. In addition to the
                    improvement in the human rights situation, Napoleon Duarte was elected president
                    in a free election. He was a Notre Dame grad so was quite effective with the
                    members of Congress. The war also began to turn around. There were some
                    preliminary peace talks with the FMLN groups in 1986 in a little town near the
                    Honduran border called La Palma.</p>

                <p>MACK: Yes. Some were some people sidelined or sent abroad.</p>

                <p>MACK: Yes. Lt Schlafenberger. He worked with the MILGROUP in the Embassy. He had
                    a girl friend who studied at the Catholic University. He would pick her up every
                    night after class. A guerrilla sympathizer obviously spotted him told his
                    friends who set up the assassination attempt. He was sitting in an armored car
                    but the a/c was not working so he had opened the window.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: Oh yes! In fact, the Churchwomen's case was successfully prosecuted while I
                    was there. The US justice department sent down a Spanish speaking lawyer named
                    Carlos Correa to work a Salvadoran lawyer to build the case. Preparations tool
                    almost two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were convicted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: About four or five National Guardsman. Apparently, the wife of one of the
                    Guardsman was an Evangelical Protestant and I guess this guy got religion too.
                    Eventually he decided to cooperate with the prosecution. And through him they
                    were able to get information about the others who were involved in the murder.
                    The trial was in a dusty little town down near the National Airport and the
                    verdict was guilty. That was a big deal, and a big political issue, especially
                    in the US. The family of the murdered churchwoman had tremendous support in the
                    US Congress and they were not going to let this case go. The Congress wasn't
                    either. It was successfully prosecuted. Many believed the higher ups had known
                    who was responsible and were involved in a cover-up. The people who actually
                    committed the murders, apparently on their own, were nailed. There was a lot of
                    excitement, a lot of excitement in the Embassy when the guilty verdict came in.
                    By the way I had a death threat, from the far right apparently. For my last year
                    I had two armed guards with automatic weapons at my house at all times. I don't
                    know if the threat was serious, but the Embassy security officer took
                    precautions. I always traveled in an armored car.</p>

                    <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way you were feeling pressure both from the right and
                        from the left, weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Right! One thing we were trying to do wahow do I say thito civilize or
                    democratize the far Righto bring them completely within the democratic process,
                    to abandon recourse to political violence. Now the Right had a lot of public
                    support. Despite what many people think the far right was quite popular and they
                    could get the vote out. Most of the Salvadoran people were basically quite
                    conservative, at least they were in my time. The proof of that is that following
                    Duarte's presidency, the rightwing party ARENA has proceeded to win every
                    presidential election to this day. Internationally observed Free elections. So,
                    our view was, look! The Right exists, has popular support, so what we need to do
                    is bring them into the legal political process to operate like a loyal
                    opposition. Remember, while I was there, the Christian Democrats under Duarte
                    were in power. Anyway that was our objective to bring the right in to political
                    process and abandon violence. That was our message to these guys. I'm not saying
                    that all the people on the Right were involved in or supported the death squads.
                    But there was some overlap between the democratic right and the violent right,
                    no question about it. I would have been kidding myself if I said it didn't
                    exist. But we wanted to strengthen those on the democratic side of the party,
                    and to democratize the Army, if possible.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes! Yes! We had some very, very close contacts. Actually we became close

                        the delegations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Absolutely! People of all persuasions. Some people came with their minds
                    made up and left with their minds made up. But, there were others who came with
                    fairly open minds and the Embassy staff worked quite hard to educate them on
                    what really was going on on the ground. And over time the majority came to
                    support the policy because they could see the reforms and the progress.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your reading of Napoleon Duarte?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>MACK: Duarte was a democrat. As I said, he was a Notre Dame graduate and a very
                    persuasive advocate with the US Congress. About 10 years earlier he had run for
                    president but had the election stolen. He really won, but was not allowed to
                    take office. He was subsequently arrested by the military, physically abusethey
                    broke his cheekbone- and exiled to Costa Rica or Mexico. I can't remember. He
                    came back and was elected President.</p>
                <p>He was basically a good and honorable man. Obviously everyone has their weak side
                    and Achilles heel. His showed when one of his daughters was kidnapped by the
                    guerrilla arm of the Orthodox Communist Party. She was taken to the guerrilla
                    base on the slopes of the Guazapa Volcano, which was a notorious area.
                    Negotiations ensued for her release. The guerrillas were demanding the release
                    of hundreds of their people from government jails..</p>
                <p>Duarte was distraught during this period. He had a difficult time functioning as
                    President. This was in 1985. Ed Corr had become Ambassador. Ambassador Corr took
                    me to meet with Duarte 30 times during the 44 days Duarte's daughter was held
                    hostage. Duarte was so upset. He was willing to agree to virtually anything to
                    get his daughter freed. He was willing to make some concessions that probably
                    were not in the best interest of the country. In fact, he probably would have
                    been willing to go farther than the final deal in which a large number of
                    guerrillas were released in exchange for his daughter and a number of government
                    mayors who had been kidnapped. For a while, we were worried he would not insist
                    on the release of the mayors. That would have been devastating. In any event,
                    that episode substantially weakened Duarte as president. But he was a decent
                    man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to something, what was your impression of
                        George Bush Sr. when he came down as Vice President?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: This actually was the second time I had met him. The first time was in
                    Saigon, I think it was 1969, when he was a Congressman from Houston and I was a
                    political officer at the Embassy. He had come to dinner at my house to meet with
                    some Vietnamese congressmen. He is a very engaging person who makes people feel
                    very much at ease in his presence and he is not arrogant. With the Salvadorans
                    his approach was to come at the problem in a positive way, saying, “look we
                    really want to help you but we can't. Please make a change in this so we can
                    help you to win.” He was firm but respectful. He did not insult anybody. So I
                    thought the message was very effectively delivered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From our understanding he was very good in foreign

                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes, and he also knew how to deal with people. He had a knack for dealing
                    with human beings —relaxing them to make them feel comfortable so that they
                    could engage in dialogue.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that Senator Helms and particularly his staff
                        were quite strong supporters of the fairly far right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes. And they often came into the country and did not want to speak to the
                    President. Our normal practice at the Embassy was not to set up any meeting to
                    which we were not invited. So they made their own arrangements in advance and
                    came. They pretty much cut us out. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feel for what they were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: No! I am sure they were whispering support in the ears of those people. Now
                    keep in mind we in the Embassy also had very close contacts with the rightwing
                    party. We spoke with these people all the time. However, when Senator Helms'
                    people came down, they went straight to their local contacts without any Embassy
                    involvement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a sort of in a way a feel good operation for the
                        Helms crew in that we were already talking to the people they were
                        seeing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: That's a very good question. I can't answer that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there did events in Nicaragua impact on El
                        Salvador as far as you could see?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well yes! I mean supplies were coming in from the Sandinistas for the
                    guerrillas in El Salvador. Some came right up the Pan American Highway hidden in
                    trucks. Other stuff came directly across the Gulf of Fonseca in speed boats from
                    Nicaragua to El Salvador.</p>
                <p>While I was in El Salvador, I actually traveled to Nicaragua with my wife on
                    vacation. I wanted to see how the other side operated. Ambassador Bergold was
                    then US ambassador to Nicaragua and his wife and mine were friends, I think from
                    language training years before and they invited us down. So we got to see a
                    whole other world. Traveled around the country. Went to a big Sandinista rally.
                    I never felt threatened. I guess they assumed I was just another
                    internationalista who supported the Sandinistas.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>But it was clear that the revolution was not going well. The people had nothing
                    to buy. Supermarkets were bare; maybe a few Romanian Sardines or something in
                    the market but that was about it. Everything was rationed, all food was
                    rationed. I remember going to a market which actually the U.S. had built several
                    years before the Sandinistas had come to power. It was a beautiful marketplace
                    but there was virtually nothing sale. Then somebody in the market told me what
                    the deal was so I went up to a guy and I asked him if he had any beans for sale.
                    There was nothing visible on his stand. Then the guy looks around to see if the
                    secret police were there and said how much you want? I said a kilo, a kilo of
                    beans. He reaches under his counter and pulls the beans he did not have
                    displayed and I paid the black market price to see how it was. You know. But
                    clearly the people were hurting. The small time entrepreneurial class, the
                    market people, were suffering greatly. These were not rich people. There were
                    just market people. I could not even buy a guayabera (a kind of shirt for which
                    the Nicaraguans are famous). I asked why and was told they did not have
                    thread.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were famous for making beautiful guayaberas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Right! Right! They did not have any supplies for making anything. For
                    example, the price of gasoline in pesos at the at the hugely inflated official
                    dollar exchange rate was very expensive, but the black market rate we were able
                    to fill up the whole tank of the embassy van driving me around for a couple of
                    bucks. Anyway dollars were in short supply.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned term” internacionalists”. These were a lot
                        of the same kids who sang protest songs from the United States..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: There were a lot of people streaming into Nicaragua to support the
                    revolution, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess they just were not welcome in El Salvador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: There were not a lot of them, and they were not particularly welcomed by
                    the government, but some were there. One woman who was there is now in jail now
                    in Peru, convicted for helping a Peruvian terrorist group, the MRTA. Her name is
                    Lori Berenson. I understand that before she moved on to Peru, she actually
                    worked as personal secretary for one of the guerrilla leaders during the peace
                    talks with the Salvadoran government at the end of the war. Apparently, she
                    never said anything, so nobody had a clue she was an American, but she was a
                    note taker and evidently spoke Spanish well.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>I also remember that occasionally college kids would come down to El Salvador.
                    Some were real idealists. They would have some local contact slip them into
                    guerrilla territory. I remember one young woman, I think from Oberlin College,
                    who spent a month or so with them. And all the while we were being hounded by
                    certain members of congress to find this poor “disappeared” young woman, with
                    the implication that she had been a victim of right wing or military violence.
                    Then she resurfaced. I think she may have been picked up by the government
                    soldiers during a skirmish with the guerrillas, and this angelic looking little
                    twenty-one year old girl comes out of the countryside having been with the
                    guerrillas for four weeks.</p>
                <p>Then there was the case of an American priest whose name I cannot recall, but who
                    was quite far to the left. He had disappeared. Since he was on the left, it was
                    feared he had been murdered by the far right. We were bombarded by Congress in
                    this case to find him, once again with the implication he had been a victim of
                    right wing violence. A month or two later he magically reappeared. When told of
                    all the concern about his wellbeing and where he had been, his answer was that
                    he had been “on a walk with the people.” That was his answer. So, yes, they were
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the Contra Movement been developed when you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that seem to have any effect or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well apparently some things were moved to Nicaragua through El Salvador,
                    although I did not have privy to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run across Ollie North in any of his
                        shenanigans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes. He came to El Salvador several times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he work with the Embassy or basically bypass the
                        Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: He came down in his official capacity as a staffer for the National
                    Security Council to see how the war in El Salvador was going. We briefed him
                    several times. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the political section making any efforts to meet with
                        the Left, the guerrillas?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>MACK: The guerrillas no; the left yes. Late in l986 just before I left a few
                    members of the FDR, an progressive group with links to the insurgency but was
                    not violent, were allowed by President Duarte to come back. And so we felt it
                    important to have a conversation with them. I had breakfast with a medical
                    doctor named Hector Silva, who had been in exile for years and who after the war
                    was elected mayor of San Salvador on the FMLN ticket. I was able to contact him
                    through because a friend knew his sister. We spoke for one hour and a half to
                    two hours. At the end of it, I concluded that this guy was a democrat, not a
                    communist. He ended up being the Mayor of San Salvador. Years after the war,
                    when the FMLN was competing in the political area, Silva challenged Shafik
                    Handal, who was a notorious hard line orthodox Communist, for the FMLN
                    presidential nomination. Handal wanted the nomination for himself so he had
                    Silva expelled from the FMLN. Otherwise, Silva might have ended up as president.
                    Handal lost badly to the ARENA candidate, by the way.</p>
                <p>Anyway, it was clear from my breakfast conversation with Silva that we could work
                    with him. And that is how things turned out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Fidel Castro was his group there or not? Were we
                        seeing Castro agents within the guerrilla movement or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I am sure they were there. We know Cuba provided specialized training for
                    guerrillas. We also knew that guerrilla leaders would slip off to Cuba from time
                    to time. My guess is that they traveled to Nicaragua somehow and from there to
                    Cuba for R&amp;R Cuba and to meet with Castro. In addition, there were leftists
                    from all over the Americas fighting with the guerrillas. There was a lot of
                    revolutionary solidarity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about working with the CIA there? Was this a place
                        where the CIA was dominant, would you say, how did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Actually I had very good relationship with the Agency. We shared a lot of
                    thoughts and information with each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes, some post ends up, — I was in South Korea at
                        one point where the CIA was basically running things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I wouldn't say that about EL Salvador. We both had our spheres of influence
                    and obvious different ways of operating. They were in intel gathering and
                    helping the Salvadorans with intelligence planning and training and special ops
                    and that sort of thing. So, obviously we were not involved in that.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were not tripping over each other.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: No, not at all, but we did compare notes on the political and military
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a good place to stop and we will pick this up when
                        you left in '86, Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I went to Paraguay and became the DCM. That was my big promotion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stroessner was there!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Alfredo Stroessner was there and in fact was overthrown toward the end of
                    my tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Next time we will pick it up '86 and off to Heir
                        Stroessner. STOP!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is the 28th of November 2005, and we are off to Paraguay and it was '86.
                    You were there from when to when?</p>
                <p>MACK: I was there from 1986 to 1989.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the state of play in Paraguay at the time first
                        in Paraguay itself and then in American/Paraguay relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: When I arrived Stroessner was in his 33rd year in power. And his
                    relationship with the United States was very poor. Because of obviously the U.S.
                    did not take kindly to his form of one party rule, which was really a
                    dictatorship, albeit a popular one. There were continuing civil and human rights
                    violations of opponents who were still being arrested. In the electoral sense,
                    Stroessner did allow some prominent politicians from the opposition party to
                    come back to Paraguay and there was an election. And of course Stroessner
                    overwhelmingly won the election.</p>
                <p>There was a joke told in Paraguay about the how the Americans are always boasting
                    about their extraordinarily modern system for tabulating presidential votes, how
                    they did all these projections within an hour of the closing of the polls based
                    voting patterns in certain precincts, how the prognosticators could predict with
                    a high deal of accuracy who would be the next President of the United States.
                    According to the joke, when Stroessner heard about the American boasts, he
                    responded that all this was very impressive but that he was able to predict the
                    results of a presidential election in Paraguay years before it was held.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any particular issue with him other than he
                        was a dictator?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Human rights and lack of political freedom in the country. Those were the
                    major issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There are dictators and dictators. What kind of rule did
                        he have at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well, when he came to power, the country had been in the midst of a long
                    civil war. He put an end to it and put his party, the Colorado party, in power.
                    He really brought order to the country. There was no question that he enjoyed a
                    lot of popular support.</p>
                <p>The country had been in shambles due to years of chaos. Stroessner began to bring
                    order to Paraguay. He made some major infrastructure improvements over time. For
                    example, the water out of the faucet was good to drink in most Paraguayan towns.
                    This is quite an achievement for a third world country. You could drink the
                    water.</p>
                <p>Having served in Central America and been sickened with dysentery and every other
                    intestinal bug known to man, I thought that was a rather impressive
                    achievement.</p>
                <p>Over time he established a decent phone system and a fairly decent road system.
                    He negotiated an end to a border dispute with Brazil regarding where in the
                    Paran� River to draw the line, paving the way for the construction of the Itaipu
                    dam between the two counties, which at that time was the largest hydraulic dam
                    in the world. I am not sure whether the Three Gorges dam in China now is the
                    largest. But Itaipu was absolutely huge. Paraguay's half the electricity
                    produced was about 20 times the demand in Paraguay at the time so Paraguay then
                    was able to sell 95% of it so to Brazil which largely financed the project with
                    the World Bank.. So by putting an end to this dispute, essentially inundating
                    the disputed area in a huge lake behind the dam which became a bi-national
                    entity, Paraguay was able to take a gigantic step forward in terms of energy
                    independence. The project employed a lot of people, gave opportunities for a
                    large number of Paraguayan firms to get lucrative contracts. I am sure not all
                    of them were awarded based on merit. But, nonetheless a lot Paraguayans learned
                    a lot of skills in the process. And he did the same thing with Argentina down
                    stream in the construction of the Yacyreta dam which was well underway at the
                    time that I was there. So he really did bring progress to the country.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, like most dictators or authoritarian figures, he did not know
                    when to leave. If he had left five or ten years earlier he would have probably
                    gone down in Paraguayan history as a greater leader despite his strong-arm rule.
                    He basically overstayed like Marcos and Fujimori did, as did a lot of
                    others.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>The fact is that Stroessner may even have had the support of the majority of the
                    population at the time he was ousted. The Colorado Party through which he ruled
                    was very well organized right down to the grassroots. He spoke Guarani. Many
                    loved him. Many did and obviously many did not. Many left the country because of
                    him. But even people who did not support him recognized that he did a like of
                    positive things. But he stayed on too long. He had many of the same acolytes
                    with him including ministers who had been with him since almost the beginning.
                    Those running the country were almost a gerontocracy, if that's the word. The
                    average age must have been seventy or seventy-five for the ministers. And by and
                    large they were corrupt but very, very loyal to Stroessner.</p>
                <p>And that was the situation when I got there. Our ambassador was very direct in
                    dealing with Paraguayan Government on human rights issues and as a result our
                    relations with the government were very, very poor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Clyde Taylor was the Ambassador when I arrived. I remember for example that
                    Ambassador Taylor was going to be awarded some sort of certificate of
                    recognition by a group of women who were trying to support democratic change in
                    Paraguay. These were not leftists by the way. These were, I think, people who
                    really did want to see real democracy come to Paraguay. They were middle and
                    upper class women and who had invited Ambassador Taylor to an evening social
                    event at which they were gone to give him an award recognizing his support to
                    human rights and democratic change.</p>
                <p>I went with Ambassador Taylor. When we got to this development of very nice new
                    houses, we found it had been completely cordoned off by the police — the entire
                    development, I don't know, maybe twenty or twenty-five houses. No one was
                    allowed to cross the police lines. The only people who got in were the women who
                    had arrived very, very early to help set up, plus Ambassador Taylor and yours
                    truly. We were able to talk our way by the police lines, I guess they didn't
                    want to cause an incident by refusing to allow the US Ambassador to enter a
                    house.</p>
                <p>So we went inside and found maybe twenty people drinking wine and eating canap�s
                    around the pool. All of a sudden a smoking missile of some sort lands, on the
                    deck of the pool. At the time I thought it was a firecracker, but it turned out
                    to be a tear gas grenade shot at the order of the Chief of Police, an old
                    Stroessner loyalist, who had decided the festivity had gone on long enough. Had
                    been watching us very closely. Just over the wall.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>And at that point we retreated inside the house to the bedroom of the woman who
                    hosted the event. All twenty of us were crammed in there. Unfortunately, she had
                    the air-conditioning going because it was very, very hot in Asuncion. And, of
                    course the air-conditioner sucked in the pepper gas and after a few minutes it
                    became rather intolerable inside. At that point, the Ambassador called his
                    trusty driver and bodyguard and we were whisked off to safety. Of course, the
                    Ambassador filed a protest for what happened with the foreign minister.</p>
                <p>To give you an idea of the type of relationship that we had with Stroessner, the
                    Chief of Police clearly was orchestrating all this. We saw him physically
                    present outside the perimeter and clearly he gave the order to launch the tear
                    gas grenade. I am sure he would not have done that without approval from a
                    higher authority. So, this gives you an example of the kind of relationship we
                    had with the Stroessner government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Stroessner doing to his own people. Were the
                        jails full of dissidents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well I don't think that at that point after thirty-five years in power
                    Stroessner had the jails filled with dissidents. There were a few but at that
                    point most who had actively opposed the regime had simply left the country or
                    shut up. I don't think there was a huge group that were actively protesting. He
                    had the place pretty well tied down. This brings us to an event celebrating his
                    seventy-fifth birthday, which was a national holiday by the way, to which the
                    diplomatic corps and spouses were invited. At that point, I was in my third year
                    as DCM and Tim Towell had replaced Ambassador Taylor. The annual event was
                    hosted by the Presidential Escort Regiment, which was basically his Praetorian
                    Guard. At that event all the senior members of the military were there. It was a
                    big event.</p>
                <p>Then somewhat after that, not too much actually , a curious event happened.
                    Unbeknownst to the U.S. Embassy, his “consuego” General Rodrigueconsuego in this
                    case meant that Stroessner's son was married to General Rodriguez' daughter -
                    was plotting against Stroessner. Understand that the two were very close,
                    General Rodriguez was his senior general and Commander of the First Cavalry
                    Division and when I say Cavalry I literally mean literally that. I paid a major
                    in that division to teach my young son how to ride!</p>
                <p>In any event, President Stroessner kept his Presidential Escort Regiment
                    stationed very near where he lived. Gen Rodriguez' division was on the edge of
                    town. Theoretically this arrangement provided protection to Stroessner. But it
                    turned out that unbeknownst to the U.S. Embassy, the plot was beginning to
                    thicken.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>General Rodriguez apparently had become convinced that Stroessner had lost
                    confidence in him. At least this was the story that I heard later. When
                    Stroessner called Rodriquez in, Rodriguez assumed he was going to be axed so he
                    claimed he couldn't go because of a leg injury. At that point, Rodriguez' group
                    decided to strike first. A few months before, Stroessner had undergone a
                    prostate operation that did not go well. Apparently there was a lot bleeding and
                    his long recovery led to speculation that he was dying or even had died. This
                    led to some jockeying among various factions for advantage just in case
                    Stroessner did not survive. Some of Stroessner's people must of picked this up
                    and for some reason believed, maybe correctly, that Rodriguez was suspect. In
                    any event, thinking that Stroessner was moving against him, Rodriguez decided to
                    move against Stroessner.</p>
                <p>This was almost unthinkable in the context of a rule that had gone on for 35
                    years. We in the American Embassy saw some clues but never put the pieces
                    together because we could not conceive Rodriguez would overthrow Stroessner,
                    given their historical and family ties. Of course, no Paraguayan believed the US
                    did not know. In fact, since I was in South Africa at the time of the coup, they
                    thought I had been sent over to secure his exile.</p>
                <p>That was absolutely not true. I had just left for South Africa before the coup
                    but was there with my wife, three of my kids and mother in law to visit the game
                    parks. The night that the coup took place we had just arrived in Pretoria. The
                    next morning a note was passed under my door informing me that Stroessner had
                    been overthrown, and asking me to call the Embassy in Asuncion. So I called
                    Ambassador Tim Towell, who said “Jim you don't have come back but I really
                    prefer that you would”. I got the message so I left my family to complete the
                    trip to the game parks alone and took the next scheduled plane to plane to Rio,
                    which was not for two days. .</p>
                <p>When I got back, I learned that bullets had flown over the Embassy compound
                    between forces loyal to Stroessner, some of which were stationed across the
                    street at the president's home, and the forces under Rodriguez who had
                    Stroessner's Presidential Escort Regiment headquarters surrounded a few blocks
                    away. Fortunately no one at the embassy was hurt. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there casualties among the Paraguayans?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>MACK: Yes, among the military, but eventually it became clear to Stroessner's
                    forces that they could not prevail against Rodriguez' division. It was a kind of
                    Mexican standoff at this point. At the end, the commander of the Escort Regiment
                    counted his own guns and realized that further resistance was futile. Stroessner
                    was sent out of the country. He is alive today. 1989 was sixteen years ago, so
                    that would make him ninety-one years old. He is living on ranch in Brazil and
                    still alive. And there are still people in Paraguay who would like to see him
                    return. He remained fairly popular. There were a considerable number of people
                    who supported him. In fact some of his younger supporters from those days are
                    powerful in the government today. The joke going around Asuncion when I was last
                    there in 2006 was a group of Stroessner supporters went to visit the old man in
                    Brazil to tell them how well the “Stronistas” were doing. He reportedly
                    responded that “he was the only one missing”.</p>
                <p>I must say under Stroessner biggest crimes were of corruption and repression of
                    political opponents. There was virtually no violent street crime at that time.
                    The streets of Asuncion were safe. This is unique among any Latin American
                    country that I have seen. In Asuncion, young women, children of the middle
                    class, high school girls would ride public buses at night to go down town to
                    promenade around in the center of town. Can you imagine that today in any other
                    country in Latin America? It is inconceivable. That is how safe things were.
                    Yes, there were burglaries and that sort of thing. But there was, virtually, no
                    violent crime. It was said that not a leaf fluttered in Paraguay without
                    Stroessner knowing about it. That was the condition in Paraguay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of Embassy did we have there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: If you add up all the agencies there were probably two hundred and sixty
                    U.S. and local employees. There were eight U.S. Government Agencies. Defense,
                    the Agency, Peace Corps AID, State, USIA, who am I leaving out?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, this man had been going since 1954 and we were
                        tutt tutting at least or shaking our heads about his human rights thing, yet
                        we had Peace Corps, we had military connections, I mean it seems like we
                        were working both sides of the street?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I guess you might say that. Paraguay was a great Peace Corps country. Peace
                    Corps volunteers were welcomed and relative safely as well. Unlike some other
                    countries.</p>
                <p>But I must say relations grew quite testy during Clyde Taylor's Ambassadorship.
                    He was very, very strong on pushing the Government to open up and on human
                    rights side so there was constant tension with the Government.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned that Paraguay was a smuggling
                        haven?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: There wee some who said that Paraguay in those days existed to provide to
                    its neighbors, the Argentines and the Brazilians, smuggled products that were
                    heavily taxed in their own countries, the most important of which I think at the
                    time was whiskey. Apparently, Paraguay was one of the largest importers of
                    Scotch Whiskey in the worlwith 3 million people. Ha! Ha!</p>
                <p>The smuggling business was huge. Whiskey, computers, condoms - you name it.
                    Whatever was in short supply in those neighboring countries or overpriced,
                    Paraguayan smugglers were happy to provide. And the smuggling was very
                    coordinated. Stroessner's military commanders controlled much of the trade. That
                    is how they made their money. Their salaries were paltry, which is why a cavalry
                    officer taught my son how to ride on the side. Stroessner's acceptance of
                    smuggling by his commanders was just part of the deal; that was the arrangement.
                    They were allowed to do that in exchange for loyalty to the government. That
                    system worked quite well. There were a lot of wealthy senior military
                    officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were we able to make any inroads on the human rights
                        thing in conjunction with other countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I would say, yes things did open up a little bit. One of the leading
                    opponents to the government was allowed to come back and begin some political
                    activity under certain restrictions. But he was allowed to come back. The
                    largest newspaper, I think it was called ABC Color if I remember correctly, was
                    allowed to resume publishing when I was there. And they were somewhat critical
                    of his government. They couldn't be too critical but the fellow who ran it
                    definitely was not Stroessner supporter. So I think because of the gerontocracy,
                    because the leadership was aging, they were not as vigorous as they might have
                    been in stamping these kinds of things out. So the government was opening up
                    somewhat. However, Stroessner gave no sign of stepping down. He was “reelected”
                    while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you read Stroessner? Did you have much contact
                        with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I had almost no contact with him. Nor did the Ambassador.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Paraguay playing any role in Latin America that we

                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>MACK: Well, I would say not a huge role, their role was smuggling. A Paraguayan
                    city across the Paran� River from Brazil, and also close to Argentina,
                    personified this. It was then officially called “Ciudad Presidente Stroessner”.
                    That city is now called “Ciudad del Este” or City of the East, and exists to
                    supply the contraband needs of those countries. Over time it attracted a very
                    interesting element from the Middle-East that settled therand later became a hot
                    point for terrorist fundraising and perhaps was even the place from which the
                    terrorist acts against the Jewish community in Buenos Aires were orchestrated.
                    At the time I was there, these terrorist acts had yet not taken place. But
                    people who engaged in every kind of smuggling activities were there. And anybody
                    who wanted to do that kind of thing seemed to be allowed into the country by one
                    means or another. My guess is that these people had to pay heavy bribes.</p>
                <p>To give you an example of he the extent corruption in Paraguay, I remember our
                    consular officer once telling me he had in front of him an applicant for a US
                    visa with a Paraguayan diplomatic passport who could not speak Spanish. It
                    turned out the guy was from Morocco. So the point is that the Paraguayans were
                    even selling their diplomatic passports to foreigners. That was the level of
                    corruption. That was an issue between us and Paraguay. Because even then we had
                    some security concerns about people traveling, for whatever purpose, to the
                    United States.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any residue of Nazi's there at that time or

                </p>
                <p>MACK: '86 that would have been 41 years after the war. I think if it were, it was
                    very, very limited at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have Nazi hunters working in the area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I don't recall if there were Nazi hunters there. I don't recall, no. I do
                    remember that there was a very old Colonel in the Paraguayan army who was
                    Russian in origin and I think came over in the 1930s as a captain in the cavalry
                    to fight with the Paraguayans. In 1986 he was still serving Stroessner loyally.
                    Remember Stroessner was probably only a young lieutenant or captain during the
                    Chaco war.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>In the 1930s Bolivia and Paraguay had fought a really nasty protracted war for
                    several years over control over a desolate region that covers half of Paraguay
                    called the Chaco. The war was largely won by Paraguay. To help them, the
                    Paraguayans hired a number of White Russian Officers who were unemployed as a
                    result of losing the war to the Bolsheviks in the early 1920s. Paraguay hired
                    them to train and lead their Army against Bolivia. These were cavalry men
                    because in the 1930s the cavalry was much more efficient in operating the
                    trackless waste of the Chaco. Interestingly enough, Bolivia hired former German
                    officers from World War I to train their Army. These officers from Russian and
                    Germany played an important role in training, and probably leading, the
                    Paraguayan and Bolivian armies in the war of the Chaco.</p>
                <p>In fact, I think some Tartar officers, White Russians, who were particular adept
                    at cavalry tactics trained the Paraguayans. They helped them defeat the
                    Bolivians in what was really a war of “water holes”. Since much of the Chaco was
                    basically a desert most of the year, whoever controlled the very few sources of
                    fresh water controlled the battlefield. It was a very bloody war and most who
                    died likely died because of dehydration rather than being shot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we deal with the Government itself. Did we go to
                        the various Ministries and other active services?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: We would seek Foreign Ministry support on various international issues,
                    which I cannot remember at this point. We were always politely received, but as
                    I recall we were not particularly successful in pushing our brief. One big issue
                    we did have was narcotics smuggling. Paraguay was a transit point for Bolivian
                    cocaine because of the porousness of the borders, the availability of landing
                    strips all over the place. This was complicated by having a corrupt government
                    and military that was complicit in smuggling. If you could smuggle whiskey you
                    certainly as heck could smuggle cocaine or whatever you wanted to smuggle.</p>
                <p>In fact, while I was there I took it upon myself to convince the DEA to reopen
                    its office due to Paraguay's role as a narcotics transit point. So drugs were an
                    increasingly sensitive issue for us. To say that we solved any major problem at
                    the time, I would say no. Paraguay was not the location of major foreign
                    successes of the U.S. at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were a lot of Paraguayan's, young men and women going to
                        the United States to study?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Not in great numbers, no. Not at that time. But there was a very active
                    Paraguay-Kansas partnership through which every year several Paraguayans went to
                    study at the University of Kansas. So over a period of years we are talking
                    about a fair number.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any of the Brazilians or the Argentines play much of a
                        role in the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>MACK: Both had very active embassies. Brazil obviously was more influential.
                    Stroessner was very astute about playing his hand of a weak country located
                    between two very, very large countries. I think he was very successful at
                    negotiating favorable relationships with both of them.</p>
                <p>For example, Paraguay is a landlocked country, lie Bolivia. They called
                    themselves a Mediterranean country which means in the middle of land not of sea.
                    Historically Paraguay used barges to export its products down the Paraguay River
                    to Argentina for onward shipment by sea. But this put them at the mercy of the
                    Argentines. So Stroessner negotiated an agreement with Brazil that gave Paraguay
                    essentially free port privileges in a port in Brazil, Paranagua. So Paraguay
                    began exporting cotton and I guess some soybeans by truck across southern Brazil
                    to this port.</p>
                <p>So Stroessner was really quite adept at following this approach. Of course the
                    Brazilians were drawing Paraguayans into their orbit by essentially offering
                    Paraguay use of a seaport. Also there were thousands of Brazilian farmers living
                    in Paraguay; maybe five or ten percent of the population was Brazilian, mostly
                    from Southern Brazil. They bought land and planted soybeans. And they leveled
                    huge amounts of their native forest in order to do so. These were very often the
                    second or third sons of farmers in Southern Brazil who were not going to inherit
                    land. The Southern Brazilians did not want to divide their property, so the sons
                    who were not going to get it would be given money to buy land in Paraguay where
                    it was cheap .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much pressure coming from Washington to do
                        something or was this a big backwater?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Let's be realistic here. Paraguay was not the central focus of U.S. Foreign
                    Policy, even to Latin America. We had our marching letter on human rights issues
                    but other than that I don't think the Secretary of State was focused day-to-day
                    on the happenings in Paraguay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Tim Towell? The reason why I asked was that he was
                        a Foreign Service Officer who quit and became a Protocol Political
                        Appointee. He not come from a background of being an enforcer type, someone
                        who could go and straighten out Stroessner.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well, actually Tim was good to work for because he really, he recognized
                    that he needed help on the substance side on Paraguay issues. And he used his
                    people. He sought counsel when the golpe against Stroessner occurred. . And the
                    Mission came together and recommended the course to take to try to steer General
                    Rodriguez toward elections, etc. to open things up. And Rodriguez to some extent
                    did that. He ran for president and was elected, naturally. I left about six
                    months after that.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>But things began to open up at that point. Rodriguez's concern was that he be
                    able to walk the streets of Paraguay after he stepped down from the Presidency.
                    He didn't want to have go into exile like Stroessner or to have to barricade
                    himself in his residence. In fact, he served a term and then he left. And there
                    was another election. But Paraguay has had a troubled history since that time.
                    One of Rodriguez's former senior commanders named Oviedo from his Cavalry
                    division wanted to become president and enjoyed support from many in the
                    Colorado party who like strongman rule. Unfortunately, he was cut from the mold
                    of a dictator. In the end he was not allowed to run. But Paraguay was had a very
                    difficult time. Still, things are more open than they were before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Paraguay play any role or show any interest in what
                        was happening up in Central America at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: in 1979 before I arrived, Somoza had been overthrown in Nicaragua by the
                    Sandinistas and was given exile in Paraguay by Stroessner. And Somoza was
                    assassinated in Paraguay after that, also before I got there. I don't remember
                    if it was one year, two years, three years, or four years, but he was
                    assassinated. His Mercedes was attacked by an armor-piercing grenade and he was
                    killed. If I recall correctly, the people who carried it out came out of
                    Nicaragua. So they sent down a group probably aided by local leftists to
                    dispatch Somoza once and for all. So was there a Central America connection? I
                    guess you could say there was. Stroessner was a stanch anti-Communist..</p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well I went back to Washington. And I became the Director of the Office of
                    Andean Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Andean Affairs consisted of what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Of five Andean countries. Which were Venezuela, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru and
                    Bolivia. There were five. Chile was handled by South Cone Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that from '89 until?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>MACK: Until '91. The Office of Andean Affairs was a very busy place. Remember
                    Colombia was not in the best of shape. The drug cartels were very strong.
                    Shortly after I arrived, the Liberal candidate for president, Gaitan, was
                    assassinated at the behest of Pablo Escobar, one of the notorious Medellin drug
                    cartel king-pins. Colombia was in very, very bad. The Government of President
                    Virgilio Barco was really shaken by the drug cartels which were enormously
                    powerful to the point where they were electing people to Congress. In fact at
                    one point, a quarter or a third of the Colombian Congress were ineligible for US
                    visas because their links in some way to narcotics trafficking or money
                    laundering. Their power went up to the Supreme Court. It was a pretty serious
                    situation.</p>
                <p>As a result of the Gaitan assassination, President Bush (the father) and his
                    National Security Council decided we needed to take a hard look at Colombia and
                    come up with a proposal to provide a massive amount of assistance for Columbia.
                    This was almost 10 years before “Plan Colombia”. This was a reaction to the
                    assassination of Gaitan and the power of the drug cartels.</p>
                <p>Over one weekend we in the Office in Andean Affairs were asked to come up with a
                    proposal to spend several hundred million dollars in support of Colombia. And in
                    addition, we were asked to come up with something that would the attention to
                    show that the U.S. really supported the government of Colombia and the other
                    Andean countries in their war against drugs.</p>
                <p>At this point I can't recall who actually came up with the idea for all of this,
                    but the Bush Administration agreed that they would propose an Andean drug summit
                    involving President Bush, Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia, Alan Garcia of Peru and
                    Virgilio Barco from Colombia. It was to take place in February, 1990. I had come
                    on board in the fall of '89 and my office had been given the lead in preparing
                    for a summit. That's what we did for my first four months on the job. Anybody
                    who has been involved with this kind of thing knows that Heads of States don't
                    just show up. A huge amount of prior planning and inter-agency coordination is
                    involved.</p>
                <p>It also involved advanced negotiations with the other countries involved in the
                    summit. It involved the negotiation in advance of six different Agreements of
                    Cooperation with each of the four countries. And that occupied my first four
                    months as Director of Andean Affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>And actually we had finished negotiating these agreements in Cartagena itself the
                    evening before the summit. So we had very little time to put them in final form
                    for signature by the respective Foreign Ministers and Secretary of State.
                    Unfortunately, when we tried to enter the changes and print them out, we
                    realized that the computer disc on which we had brought the draft agreements was
                    not compatible with the computers we had available at the hotel. As a result , a
                    heroic US Embassy secretary, I think the wife of a MILGRP officer, stayed up all
                    night retyping them into the computer. This was a huge job. She didn't finish
                    until after the official caravan taking the staffers had left the hotel for the
                    summit site, which was the Colombian president's equivalent of a summer white
                    house. This was a highly secure location at the tip of a peninsula. You first
                    had to go through a naval base just to get to the outside walls of the
                    presidential villa. I am telling you with the presence of 4 presidents including
                    George Bush, and with worries about missile threats from Pablo Escobar, security
                    was tight!!</p>
                <p>Anyway, I missed the caravan by a half hour. By the time I got from the hotel
                    through the Naval Base, the gate through the wall to the presidential retreat
                    was closed tight, with the guards under strict orders not to allow nobody to
                    pass.</p>
                <p>I had the six agreements that were supposed to be signed the three foreign
                    ministers and secretary of state James Baker. What to do. I was able to make
                    telephonic contact with a colleague on the other side who came to his side of he
                    wall. So I threw my brief case containing the agreements over the wall to him.
                    Eventually I did get in. The agreements were signed. It was kind of funny how it
                    took place. Because security was very, very tight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did the Summit turn out?.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well it actual came off quite well. The Summit launched substantially
                    increased U.S. support for the Andean countries. It was quite a show. US Chinook
                    helicopters from the US Naval ships off the horizon, a huge protective detail
                    for Bush.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you were charged with this, doing something
                        about this, what were you looking at?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well we were looking at the protection of Colombian judges. That was one
                    thing. Judges were being assassinated by the dozens by the cartel. They were
                    afraid to hear cases involving drug trafficking and to render verdicts. So one
                    of the first things we focused on was physical protection for the judges.
                    Armored cars, secured court buildings, secure communications. The Colombians
                    also borrowed a concept of “faceless judges” from Italy by the way from Sicily
                    to protect their judges. The judges heard cases behind a screen so their faces
                    could not be seen by the defendants. That was a major area that we looked into.
                    There were other kinds of systems as well.</p>

                <p>MACK: Venezuela and Ecuador were not part of the summit. Only the three major
                    Andean drug producers: Columbia, Bolivia and Peru, plus the US. Ecuador was not
                    a serious drug producer. So, only the three that were there. They agreed on a
                    set of principles for fighting drugs, including the concept that in certain
                    circumstances their military could be involved. That was a tough one. They also
                    agreed on the concept that both the drug producing and consuming countries had a
                    shared responsibility to cooperate to deal with the drug problem . Previously
                    the three producing countries were constantly blaming U.S. drug consumption for
                    the problem. We, of course, blamed them for producing drugs. The declaration of
                    principles established that everybody was part of the problem so everybody had
                    to be a part of the solution. The time had passed for name calling, etc. We felt
                    that the militaries of these countries ought to be involved when appropriate
                    although the Latin countries had been reluctant because they saw drugs as a
                    police function and also did not want the military to become corrupted by drugs.
                    And in fact, in some cases corruption did happen, such as in Peru. But we argued
                    that the Cartel was so strong that the military had to get involved with the
                    problem. The police could not possibly handle it alone. So in Colombia, in fact,
                    the military did get involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there long enough to see the beginning of the
                        shift to change?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well, I mean you have to put it into context because the U.S. consumption
                    was rising through the mid-eighties. We had a very, very high level of
                    consumption of drugs. Consumption in the US began to drop in the late eighties
                    and early nineties in large part because the U.S. took internal measures, not
                    only law enforcement measures, but also to reduce demand . Many parental groups
                    got involved because they saw that drugs were destroying the fabric of our
                    country. We were losing a generation of young people. A series of activities and
                    programs took place that I think had the cumulative effect of dampening the
                    demand for drugs in the United States.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, as the U.S. market leveled off, the cartels began marketing
                    cocaine in Europe. Consumption there began from almost nothing in 1990 to today
                    they where consume a quarter of all the cocaine produced. The U.S. consumes
                    about half of the cocaine produced maybe a little less whereas 20 years ago we
                    consumed about 80 percent of all of it. So the Europeans have, unfortunately
                    acquired a problem, because the narcotic traffickers were good businessmen. They
                    developed another market for their product when they saw the U.S. market was not
                    expanding. Coca planting was still going up in the early nineties in all those
                    countries. It began to drop somewhat in the late nineties.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously you had to deal with the Drug Enforcement
                        Agency. How did you find that and the other enforcement agencies? Was this
                        difficult?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I didn't personally have a big problem. Obviously we had different
                    corporate cultures. But I had worked with the DEA people before and I was
                    certainly able to work with them while I was working with the Office of Andean
                    Affairs. I got along quite well with other agencies. Maybe I just didn't have
                    the cultural hang-ups that some people seem to have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was under the first Bush Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: That is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The whole drug business was quite a priority of that
                        Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: A very, very big priority. We also did a lot of high level trip
                    preparation. The Cartagena Summit. President Bush went to Caracas. Vice
                    President Quayle traveled to Bogota and then we had the Presidents of Peru,
                    Colombia and Venezuela traveling the United States during this period. And of
                    course our office in charge of papering these visits. From your experience, you
                    know what that means. All the preparation, all the scene setters, all the
                    talking points, and all the liaison with the secret service.</p>
                <p>Bush was very, very good by the way. I have to put a plug-in for the Bush the
                    father. He really appreciated the Foreign Service. Obviously, with his
                    experience with the Agency and as Ambassador to China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the U.N.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: And the United Nations. He was very good about recognizing and rewarding
                    people who knock themselves out organizing his visits. And he always made a
                    point out of inviting the Desk Officers and the Office Directors to the big
                    social event he held at the White House for presidential level visits. I think
                    that a very strong motivating factor for people was that he recognized the hard
                    work of the people in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you were there doing this until 91?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: That is correct.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then went where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well after '91 I went to Ecuador as the Deputy Chief of Mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It probably would be a good place to stop here and pick it
                        up then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Okay, today is the 16th of February 2006. Jim you are in Ecuador from when to
                    when?</p>
                <p>MACK: I was in Ecuador from 1991 to 1994.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And who was the Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: His name was Paul Lambert. He was a good friend and Yale classmate of
                    George Bush the first. I think they both played on the Yale baseball team. And
                    Lambert was a prominent estate lawyer in New York City and I think an excellent
                    fundraiser for the Republican Party in New York City. Very decent guy, a very,
                    very decent guy. He was nominated for his ambassadorship I guess about a year
                    before I got there, roughly. I had met him when he came through Andean Affairs
                    for his briefing before he was confirmed. I was then the Director of Andean
                    Affairs at the Department of State. When the position of DCM became available as
                    it did shortly after he got there, he asked me if I would like to go down there
                    and I said that I would. I arrived in the early fall of '91, in about
                    September.</p>
                <p>Two weeks before I got on the plane in September, 1991, he called me on the phone
                    from Ecuador. He had already been at post for six months. He said, “Jim I wanted
                    you to know that I have just submitted my resignation to the President effective
                    January, 1992. In other words, he said. I have given the President five months
                    to find a replacement.” I said, “Well, thanks for telling me; I haven't really
                    signed up to be Charge,” but he explained why he was leaving and I
                    understood.</p>
                <p>Prior to taking his ambassadorship, he had been at a major firm in New York for
                    years. At that point he was 62. He had a large stable of clients who used his
                    services, and when he was tapped to be ambassador he left his clients under the
                    charge of a young lawyer who they had brought into the firm. When the clients
                    who had been working with Paul Lambert for years realized that he was going to
                    be gone for a long time, and recognized that they would need his services in the
                    interim, said, “Paul, your prot�g� has just informed us that he is leaving the
                    firm. Unless you tell us that you are coming back shortly, we are going to go
                    with him to his new firm.”</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>So he really had to make a choice. As I said, he was 62 and to try to rebuild a
                    client base at that age is not a simple thing. So he elected to terminate his
                    ambassadorship and go back to his profession and his clients. He is probably
                    still working as far as I know. In any event, I got to post recognizing that he
                    would be leaving in four months later. And he did. He left in January, 2002.</p>
                <p>President Bush, the father, immediately named a friend of his from Texas, an oil
                    man, to replace Lambert. I understand he actually could speak Spanish. I never
                    met him. Can't even remember his name. Now as you may recall, the Democrats
                    thought 1992 would be their year, as it was, and they already did have control
                    of the Senate if I recall correctly. And the Senate never even gave this
                    gentleman a hearing. Which meant that I remained as Charge through the end of
                    the Bush Administration. Then Clinton came in in January 1992 Ecuador was not at
                    the top of his agenda. So by the time he did and a new ambassador was confirmed
                    it was already November 2003. I had been Charge for twenty-two months. It was a
                    very interesting time. Pete Romero was the new ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay well lets talk about when you went out there you had
                        been dealing with the bureau and all of the situations there. What was the
                        situation in Ecuador and well, politically; economically and all at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well, Ecuador as you know has a substantial amount of natural wealth. It is
                    an oil exporter, is a major banana producer; shrimp producer, gets a lot of
                    tourism and has a fairly balanced economy, but it is largely an extraction and
                    farming economy. Parts of the economy did very well. When the price of oil was
                    high in the boon times in the 70's, the country really developed very, very
                    quickly under a benign military dictatorship. When the price of oil dropped, the
                    government did not have the income it had before and the development of the
                    infrastructure slowed down. And the government in power when I got there was of
                    the democratic left, not totally committed to private enterprise and certainly
                    not supportive of foreign investment in a big way.</p>
                <p>There also were some impediments to export. Ecuador was then getting into the cut
                    flower business. Colombia had the market but Ecuador was getting in big time.
                    But there were many bureaucratic steps to export each flower shipment, which was
                    perishable and had to be processed quickly. I remember that one of the first
                    speeches I made dealt with the kind of things the government should do to cut
                    bureaucratic impediments to exports. There also were also oil issues. Texaco had
                    been there for sometime. It had discovered the oil in Ecuador in the late '60's.
                    But under their contract they were fazing out and turning their wells over to
                    the state owned oil company. Petroecuador I think it is called now. There was a
                    major lawsuit against Texaco brought by some environmental groups in the United
                    States using some indigenous groups in Ecuador as their pretext, suing Texaco
                    for billions of dollars for destruction of the environment.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>And there was another small U.S. company that discovered oil in an area inhabited
                    by some indigenous people on the Amazon side. Almost all the oil was on the
                    Amazon side of the country. This particular group, the Wai Wai, had been
                    contacted back in the '50's by some North American evangelical missionaries.
                    There was a very famous story about that. Five young male missionaries were
                    murdered by the Wai Wai in the initial contact attempt, they had landed in a
                    sandbar in a river that flowed through Wai Wai territory. After that the sister
                    of one of missionaries who was killed made it her life's work to live among
                    them. In any event, the US company did a pretty good job of protecting the
                    environment where it was working. They built no bridges over the major rivers in
                    the area to keep out squatters. The roads they built were made with a special
                    textile base minimize disturbing the environment and were built as narrow as
                    possible. Still the environmentalist movement in the US remained still pretty
                    much opposed to any further oil development in the Amazon. Later the company was
                    bought out by an Argentine firm. I have not followed it since then, but the
                    initial development was done pretty well in my view.</p>
                <p>I traveled twice to the area to see for myself. The second time was for a
                    ceremonial signing agreement between the oil company and the various
                    semi-nomadic clans that made up the tribe of then about 1500. We flew in in
                    single engine missionary planes and landed at a tiny grass strip built by the
                    missionaries years before. The president of Ecuador, Sixto Dur�n-Ball�n followed
                    in a huge Sikorsky helicopter. As the chopper taxied toward the meeting site,
                    where hundreds of Wai Wai were gathered, the strip on both sides of the strip
                    were lined by an honor guard of dozens of stone age tribesman dressed in their
                    typical Amazonian splendor, which means virtually nothing, with their 8 foot
                    long spears raised in the air. I'll show you one in my kitchen. It was quite a
                    scene!!!.</p>
                <p>Cocaine trafficking was also a big issue in Ecuador. It was coming out from
                    southern Colombia through Ecuador. Early in my tenure, a major Ecuadorian Drug
                    Cartel was taken down by an elite Ecuadorian police unit trained by us. It was a
                    rather large operation. In addition, we were able to persuade the Ecuadorian
                    Government to agree allow us mount a radar for them on a volcano on the
                    Amazonian side to detect drug flights coming up from Peru to Colombia through
                    Ecuadorian airspace. That proved quite successful. So the drug issue was very
                    important.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>Another big challenge for us internally was funding. At that time all at the
                    embassies were suffering through budget cuts. I am talking about cuts in embassy
                    operating expenses so we had to find ways to save money to meet our lower budget
                    target. And we did meet our new targets. And since the Ambassador's residence
                    was unoccupied, one of the ways we saved money was to put up TDYers and newly
                    arrived staff there, as opposed to a hotel, as long as they didn't have any
                    children. This also kept the residence staff, whose salaries we had to pay
                    anyway, on their toes. We did this for a year and a half and probably saved 60
                    or 80 thousand dollars in TDY expenses in that period. There were those who
                    probably were not too delighted with the idea, but we did not have any major
                    problems and we were able to save ourselves a lot of money from funds that came
                    out of the embassy budget.</p>

                <p>MACK: That issue did not raise its head in the fullest extent until after I
                    transferred from Ecuador to Peru. I was in Peru at the time the war broke out.
                    But having been in Ecuador before certainly gave me insights into both sides of
                    the issue.</p>

                <p>MACK: I think you are describing in an interesting way two facets of the
                    Ecuadorian mind. One was I think that was embedded in the DNA of the political
                    culture in Ecuador, an particularly that of the highlands, was a huge distrust
                    of foreign investment. The party in power at the time I got there was a
                    left-leaning and they were certainly very, very suspicious of business. You will
                    recall this was 1991. I had arrived just after the Soviet Union collapsed. And
                    so Ecuadorian government realized that, I think, that things were going to
                    change.</p>
                <p>On the other hand we are talking about leaders of one of the major parties who
                    had grown up basically on Marxian rhetoric The universities, the national
                    universities, were basically run politically leftists. So the idea of an open
                    free-market approach to development was not one that was embraced by many, many
                    people in the middle class in the highlands. Interestingly enough, these leftist
                    views were more strongly held in the highlands where the government, but not the
                    natural resources, was located, than on the coast where their half of the
                    population lives and a strong tradition of an export economy existebananas,
                    fish, shrimp and other tropical products. A very small portion of the population
                    lived in the Amazon where the oil was. There was also a very strong
                    entrepreneurial class on the coast. But regarding the other point you made,
                    there was a lot of extortion of business, both local business and foreign
                    business.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>The courts were corrupt by and large and the result was that a local business
                    partner with a foreign partner could avail himself of the courts to win a
                    dispute or to blackmail a foreign investor. I will give you an example. Not
                    infrequently, American investor, who had a partner in Ecuador, would come down
                    to settle the problem and find himself under arrest on a Friday, evening. This
                    is how that would happen. The local partner would have bribed a judge to issue
                    an order of arrest of the foreigner just before COB on Friday so the individual
                    would have to spend the weekend in jail. Since many Americans would not want to
                    endure a weekend in an Ecuadorian jail, they would settle up right away on terms
                    favorable to the Ecuadorian partner.</p>
                <p>A very, very unfortunate case involved a naturalized American from Colombia, a
                    civil engineer on a Quito water project, who had suspended his project because
                    his company was not getting paid. He was arrested and thrown into jail for the
                    weekend. It turned out he was a diabetic and had no insulin with him. He started
                    going into insulin shock and would have died if he hadn't prevailed on a
                    sympathetic guard to slip a note to the American Embassy, which is how we found
                    out. And he was going into a coma when we got to him and secured his release. If
                    we had not, he would have died. So Ecuador really was a difficult place for
                    investors to do business.</p>
                <p>Now obviously big firms like Bell South and the oil companies could fend for
                    themselves, mostly. But they had problems too. Ecuador, potentially, could be a
                    very, very prosperous country. But it definitely did not achieve a tenth of what
                    it is capable of doing. For the last ten years or so there has been a huge
                    exodus of its young people going to the U.S. and Europe because of the lack of
                    opportunity at home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with the two Ecuadorian governments you
                        worked with during your time when American businesses were having
                        problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well, both governments would hear us out, but clearly the second government
                    I had to deal with , that of Sixto Dur�n-Ball�n, was much more marketed
                    oriented. We had good access to him personally and to his ministers. But even in
                    the Dur�n-Ball�n administration, the government would find funny ways to make
                    investment difficult, for their own people as well as foreigners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the economy work fairly well with this type of
                        attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>MACK: Well, it worked fairly well because of the abundance of natural resources,
                    which could be mined. Oil provided one-half of the government's budget. So that
                    was a tremendous cushion for the Ecuadorian Government. When you have billion
                    dollars a year coming in, which at today's prices would be three billion
                    something, it pardons a lot of administrative sins. So yes, there was economic
                    activity there. Certainly life in Quito was for people who had middle-class
                    income or above was very, very good. Quito was a delightful place to live. It
                    was a clean city 9,300 feet above sea level. The climate was cool and the
                    setting spectacular, It awesomely beautiful. From where I lived you could see
                    five glacier covered volcanoes and a forest across the city. Quito was located
                    in a valley, a long narrow valley. We lived on one side and could look at the
                    other which was a volcano that was occasionally snow-covered. It was just a
                    delightful place to live.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sticking to the business-side, were there Americans
                        involved in the flower business, the cut-flower business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes. But I think at the time most of them were either Colombian or
                    Ecuadorian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The reason I asked is because there is a real problem in
                        the cut-flower business, in that usually these young women have do work in
                        an environment that is heavily chemicalized. This is not good for
                        people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well! That is certainly one side of it. The other side is that tens of
                    thousands of women found work and regular cash income outside their home for the
                    first time in their lives. I don't know whether your concerns regarding
                    chemicals are completely justified. But yes! Of course you have to spray the
                    flowers to keep the wee beasties away. Everything is done scientifically. They
                    apply exactly what the rose needs by drip irrigation. I don't know what the long
                    term impact is.</p>
                <p>Were you referring to the insecticides and fungicides?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes I remember seeing some reports about this maybe about
                        twenty or thirty years ago in Columbia</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: If there was some truth to this concern at that time, I would imagine that
                    more benign types of Herbicides and Fungicides are being used today. And keep in
                    mind as I just said, the flower industry brought about significant social change
                    in some of the rural areas in the highlands where the cut flower industry is
                    located.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>It empowered women, because about 80 percent of the workers in the flower
                    industry were, and I suppose still are, women. The men did the heavy lifting
                    kind of stuff and the women did the fine motor work like pruning, cutting and
                    packing. The flower industry provided work outside the home to large numbers of
                    rural women in the highlands for the first time. And they tended to spend it on
                    things the family really needed. So instead of the husband pissing it away on
                    liquor or something, women tended to save it and spend it on family necessities.
                    Of course, when women started working outside the home, that produced some
                    social tension for obvious reasons. I don't know how it all turned out. I have
                    been away for twelve or fifteen years now. I would be interested in reading a
                    report about how that all came out.</p>
                <p>Oh! I forgot one of the major industries in Ecuador is tourism. Ecuador, I would
                    say, square mile for square mile is the most fascinating country that I have
                    ever seen. Absolutely phenomenal! Whether you are interested in the Galapagos
                    Islands, the Coastal Forest, the Indian highlands, the Volcanoes, the
                    Glacier-covered volcanoes, the Amazonian jungle, its all there. My family did
                    all this by the way. We did a lot of backpacking. It is just phenomenal. There
                    are lots and lots of things of interest for tourists. It was just a great place.
                    I wrote a tour guide based on our adventures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems of lost Americans or Americans
                        getting in trouble as tourists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes! The problem was mostly along the Colombian border on the Amazonian
                    side where the FARC Columbian guerilla group then, and even now, was very
                    strong. While I was posted to Ecuador, several Americans were kidnapped for
                    ransom either by the FARC or by bandits, perhaps some of them ex-FARC. Some
                    victims worked for the oil companies and had a reason to be there. Others were
                    just adventurers that insisted on going to the area against Embassy warnings
                    about how dangerous the area could be. So yes, there was a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in any of the cases, trying to deal
                        with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes but not directly. Obviously, I did not do any negotiations directly. If
                    the victims worked for the oil companies, the companies would bring in their own
                    security people in, or hire expert negotiators to try to establish contact with
                    the kidnappers and negotiate the ransom. The companies did not want the
                    Ecuadorian government, or the US government for that matter, involved because
                    they did not trust its competence to deal with this type of situation, and of
                    course because the companies were prepared to pay the ransom, which is
                    something, by the way, the U. S. does not support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What role did the military play in Ecuador at this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>MACK: Well! The Ecuadorian military was quite well regarded by the populace
                    because it had controlled the government during the period of the greatest
                    economic growth probably in the history of Ecuador, which were the seventies and
                    eighties. The growth was stimulated by Texaco's discovery and exploitation of
                    large deposits of oil in the Ecuadorian Amazon. While it was in control, the
                    military tended not to apply harsh measures against the population. In fact, in
                    contrast to, for example, the Chilean and Argentine situations, the military
                    dictatorship was referred to as a “dictablanda” or soft dictatorship. In
                    addition, the Ecuadorian Army was very active in civic action type activities.
                    They were seen as agents of national development, and they saw themselves as
                    ultimate bastion of protection of the state and the welfare of the people. And
                    they were quite popular.</p>
                <p>In fact, the military was often more popular then the politicians. I mentioned
                    the oil boom that coincided with the military rule. The military considered, and
                    still does, oil as a strategic asset, and it certainly is for Ecuador. As a
                    consequence, the military deployed large numbers of troops to the oil producing
                    region to make sure there would be no interruption of the movement of oil
                    through the pipeline across the Andes over a 16,000 foot pass to the Pacific
                    ports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Were interruptions of the pipeline.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Not very often when I was there although the oil workers unions would stage
                    occasional strikes that shut things down temporarily. However, the companies
                    kept a supply of oil in holding tanks at the port so they could to load the oil
                    tankers even if there were a short shut down. Historically, the most serious
                    interruptions were caused by earthquakes. The Ecuadorian Andes are a very
                    earthquake prone zone. Prior to my coming and subsequent to my leaving there
                    were some major earthquakes that severely damaged the pipeline and interrupted
                    oil exports for a long time. These were devastating for the economy and national
                    treasury since oil was the source of half of the government's revenue at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did arms sales or potential arm sales occupy you at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Not arms per se, but military supplies yes. A major U.S. electronics
                    manufacturer, Harris Corporation out of Rochester, NY, if I recall correctly,
                    was bidding on a multi-million contract to sell a field radio communication
                    system to the Ecuadorian Army.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>There were field trials. The main competition was a between Harris and an Israeli
                    company, whose name I cannot recall. Harris alleged that the Israelis paid
                    someone off to sabotage their equipment just before the field trial and that as
                    a result, Harris did badly and lost the contract to the Israelis. The Harris
                    people were furious. And it fell to me as Charge to meet with the Commander of
                    the Ecuadorian Army to express my concern about what had happened. I cannot
                    recall how that finally came out. I don't think the Americans won the contract,
                    but they did get a hearing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the drug business, while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well I told you that cocaine was coming out of Columbia through Ecuadorian
                    ports for transport by boat to the U.S. Also precursor chemicals used to produce
                    cocaine came through Ecuador en route to Southern Columbia, as contraband. So
                    drugs were a big issue. Then there was the case of a retired Admiral in the
                    Ecuadorian Navy who had founded a bank in Ecuador and an off shore bank in the
                    Caribbean that we were fairly certain was laundering drug money. The Admiral
                    expressed outrage to me, alleging he had been falsely accused and was always
                    trying to clear his name. And a major Ecuadorian drug smuggling cartel was taken
                    down while I was there with significant help from DEA and another US agency. The
                    Reyes Torres cartel. That was a little touchy because a daughter of one of the
                    Reyes Torres clan was in my son's seventh grade class at Colegio Cotopaxi. In
                    fact, she had attended a class party at my house.</p>
                <p>So, yes, drugs were a big issue. Not as big an issue as Columbia but nonetheless
                    a serious issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see then that drug money was beginning to corrupt
                        the legal system and all of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well, I can't say that drugs were the only source of corruption in the
                    legal system. However, following Reyes Torres' arrest, it appeared to us that
                    his associates were trying to move the courts to spring him on a technicality.
                    President Borja's Minister of Government at the time showed a lot of courage in
                    trying to keep Reyes Torres behind bars, and also putting him there. Beyond
                    drugs, there was certainly a lot of corruption in the legal system, and that
                    preceded the drug problem. I am not suggesting that every judge was corrupt; I
                    don't believe that is the case. But, there was corruption. And it impacted on US
                    businessmen trying to work in Ecuador. So corruption in the legal system was a
                    great area of concern for us.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they change anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well through the elections, the government changed from Center Left under
                    Rodrigo Borja to Center Right under Sixto Dur�n-Ball�n. Ecuador was definitely
                    developing even before Sixto. There was no question about it. Investment was
                    going in because there was so much potential there. The early 90s were a period
                    of the high tech boom. Cell phones were coming into their time. Ecuador was and
                    still is a significant oil exporter, not in the league of Venezuela, but it
                    certainly had the potential to export a lot more oil than it is exporting right
                    now. It probably could export about as much as a million barrels a day if it
                    developed its oil fields to the maximum, but is probably exporting half of
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the church, was the church an important
                        influence at that time, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I don't recall that it had any greater influence in Ecuador than other
                    Latin American Countries and I don't recall a major situation occurring that
                    showed the role of the Catholic Church to be essentially different that that of
                    other Latin American Countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there a lot of American Pentecostal type missionaries
                        wandering around the place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes, there were lots of Evangelical missionaries there. The powerful
                    evangelical radio station, called “la Voz de los Andes or “Voice of the Andes”
                    was located in Quito. Unfortunately, one group that had been working with the
                    Amazonian tribes for decades had been forced out three weeks before my arrival.
                    They were accused of being CIA front, which was an absurd charge. And I think
                    that the Amazonian Indian tribes lost a very strong source of support when this
                    missionary group was forced out. Missionary schools were training the Indian
                    kids who became teachers and went back to their communities. Missionary
                    hospitals and clinics provide health care, that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they cause any particular problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Not at all, not that I was really aware of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Did you know any Catholic priests?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>MACK: I knew many of them. One of our best friends, Padre Pacho Eguez, happened
                    to be a Jesuit Priest. He was a serious hiker, in his 60s at that point. He
                    really knew the mountains of Ecuador. Every month he would take my family and me
                    somewhere to go hiking. Sometimes just for the day, sometimes for one or two
                    nights. I came to know much of Ecuador thanks to him. He taught at the Catholic
                    University right across the street from the Embassy. Through Padre Pacho, my
                    family and I were able to spend with several days with some Italian Salesian
                    priests working in the Southern Amazonian jungle with the Azuar Indians,
                    formerly known as head shrinkers. We also were close to a US missionary priest
                    who runs a school in Quito to train boys from dysfunctional families in
                    vocational skills. So in a way, both the evangelical missionaries and the
                    Catholic priests and missionaries really helped shape my understanding of
                    Ecuador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Peace Corps, did we have a Peace Corps
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: We had a very, very active Peace Corps. Ecuador was a great Peace Corps
                    country. Volunteers were all over the place. I am a former Peace Corps
                    volunteer. So we enjoyed visiting the volunteers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of work were they doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Oh! They were doing community development work. They were working with the
                    small businesses. They were teaching forestry. There over two hundred of
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about relations between the Embassy and the Consulate
                        General in Guayaquil? I know the world view of the Guayaquilenos, with their
                        business focus, and the Quitenos, with their government focus are worlds
                        apart.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: During my stay, our relations with the American Consulate General in
                    Guayaquil were excellent. I made it my business to go down at least once a
                    month. And when there I would have an active schedule of meeting people and
                    giving speeches to business groups etc. I would also bring the consul general up
                    to Quito. Her name was Gwen Clare. Later she became US Ambassador to Ecuador.
                    Our relationship was fine. You are right about the different world view of the
                    people on the coast from the people in Quito. They were almost two different
                    countries.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well! That is the way he would die in Guayaquil. Yellow Fever! Right! It
                    was not a very healthy place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a new Ambassador while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes, Peter Romero came in at the end of November of 2003. I finished out my
                    tour and left in roughly May or June of 2004.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Pete was a take charge type of guy. So even though I had been Charge for
                    almost two years, when Pete came in there was no question about who was the
                    Ambassador, and that was Pete. He was a very energetic type of guy and he got
                    around a lot. He put his stamp on Embassy. Obviously I had to step back, which I
                    did. In a situation like this, some former Charges simply leave post, but I had
                    kids in school and I did not want to leave. Pete and I had known each other. We
                    both worked to make it work. .</p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: Not at that level. We did have Sen. Boren from Oklahoma.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: Not at that point. Also the social-economic level of the people coming was
                    quite low. Many were illegal so they did not have a huge congressional access
                    that some immigrant groups now have in Congress.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Alvin Adams. Previously, he had been Ambassador to Haiti. My wife and I
                    decided to take the assignment to Lima really because of my oldest daughter
                    Sally. Sally was going to be a senior in high school and had been in the
                    International Baccalaureate Program at the American School in Quito. We knew
                    that the American School in Lima, Colegio Roosevelt, was an excellent school,
                    and it had the IB program as well. I had actually wanted to go to Guadalajara as
                    consul general and was offered the job, but when I researched the American
                    school there, I learned that it was not very good. They also did not have a
                    International Baccalaureate Program. So we went to Peru for my daughter's sake.
                    Lima was a very different type of tour.</p>
                <p>Fujimori was President and at that point Peru was the Saudi Arabia of coca, the
                    raw material for cocaine. They produced more coca than Colombia and Bolivia
                    combined at that point. Peru had two insurgencies, which were declining strength
                    but, nonetheless, still quite dangerous. One was the MRTA and the other the
                    Shining Path or Sendero Luminoso. Even in Lima there were fairly frequent
                    bombings and shootouts. The MRTA was the more traditional revolutionary
                    movement, with links to the Central Americans guerrilla groups. In 1995, this
                    group had planned very thoroughly to take over the Congress of Peru which was
                    housed in a 1930's fortress type building. For this purpose they had purchased
                    or made Peruvian military police uniforms and had a vehicle painted up to look
                    just like a Peruvian Army truck. To execute the plan they had brought 45 of
                    their fighters out of the jungle to Lima and staged them for two weeks in a
                    house in one of Lima's tonier suburbs to put the fine fitting touches on their
                    preparations.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, somebody in the neighborhood noticed an awful lot of bread being
                    delivered to the door every day and tipped off the police, who surrounded the
                    house. There was a big shoot-out and a number of people were killed. The police
                    captured all those who survived as well as 45 weapons, ammunition and
                    explosives.. And, therefore, the takeover attempt on the Peruvian Congress never
                    happened. It was going to take place in two days.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>An American involved in the group was arrested separately. Her name was Lori
                    Berenson. She had been living at that house and apparently was the lover of the
                    leader of the MRTA unit that was posed take over the Peruvian Congress. She had
                    been scouting the Congress with the wife of the overall MRTA leader posing as a
                    journalist from the “Third World Press”, of Brooklyn New York. Her ruse
                    apparently was an interview with one of the female members of Peruvian Congress
                    about what it was like to be a female member of Congress. Anyway she was
                    arrested getting on to a bus the same day the police raided the house where the
                    guerrillas staying. Her arrest became a cause celebre in the U.S. and the
                    subject of an enormous “free Lori” campaign in the US, I think orchestrated by
                    her parents, both of whom were university professors in NY City. Twelve years
                    later I believe she is still in jail probably because the Peruvian population
                    was outraged that a foreigner had actively aided and abetted a violent guerrilla
                    group that had cost so much pain and suffering to Peru.</p>
                <p>Almost exactly one year after the first failed attack and Berenson's arrest, the
                    same group, this time led by the group's maximo jefe successfully took over the
                    residence of the Japanese ambassador and took hostage 700 people who were
                    attending a reception in honor of the emperor's birthday. 72 of them remained
                    hostage for over 4 months. So yes, the guerilla groups were active when I was
                    there, but little by little Fujimori was applying the pressure successfully with
                    the support of the notorious Vladimiro Lenin Montesinos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was his Chief of Intelligence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: His Chief of Intelligence who did all sorts of other things. Fujimori had
                    recognized that Peru's role as the major supplier of raw coca and cocaine paste
                    to the Colombian cartels was jeopardizing his efforts to bring about central
                    government control of the country. The guerrillas were living off the proceeds
                    of their taxation of the coca growers and processors and of taxation of the
                    aircraft that landed in the jungle to take the cocaine “base” back to Colombia
                    for refining into cocaine HCL. And Fujimori recognized that to get a handle on
                    the guerillas he had to cut off the source of their financial support.
                    Therefore, he moved very vigorously to support a plan to intercept aircraft that
                    Colombian pilots and pilots of other nationalities were flying in to pick up the
                    loads of cocaine base for processing back in Colombia. The US contribution was
                    to help the Peruvians acquire the information on when these planes were coming
                    ithe date, time of day, and landing location so that the Peruvian Air Force
                    would be ready to receive them. Intercepting narco-aircraft isn't quite as
                    tricky as you would imagine if you know when and where the planes are coming. We
                    started this cooperation with Peru early 1995 if I am remembering correctly
                    shortly after a US law had been changed to allow us to provide intel, in this
                    case Peru, to intercept civilian aircraft bearing cocaine, provided certain
                    safeguards were followed to insure the aircraft that the Peruvians had
                    intercepted was the right one. I think for this sharing to be possible, the US
                    president also had to certify that drug trafficking from Peru was a threat to US
                    national security.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>Between January of '95 until May of 1996 I think there were twenty or so
                    successful “events” in which Peruvian intercept aircraft successfully
                    intercepted narco aircraft, either in the air, on the ground as they loaded the
                    cocaine base to transport to Colombia. A number of them were shot down, when
                    they refused to land. Some of them were forced down. Some of them landed after
                    the pilot realized he could not escape. Some were destroyed on the ground. It
                    took about a year and a half for the first narco pilot to agree to land
                    peacefully. I was surprised it took so long because the intercept success rate
                    was quite high. But the upshot of these successful intercepts was that fewer and
                    fewer pilots were willing to make trips to Peru to pick up a load of cocaine
                    base.</p>
                <p>But the coca bushes kept producing coca leaves . And the peasants kept making the
                    coca paste and coca base so the stuff started piling up in Peru. When you have
                    too much of something, what happens? The price drops. And the price of coca and
                    coca base in Peru dropped over 80% to what was well below the cost of production
                    . And when that happened the most coca farmers simply abandoned their coca
                    fields. The weeds grew up and killed the coca. The result was in a four or five
                    year period the coca production in Peru dropped by 70% percent. This was a real
                    success story. .</p>

                        Pentagon said, let's look at this because we getting all these radar tracks
                        of narcotics aircraft flying between Peru and Colombia, but that after the
                        Russians had shot down a civilian Korean Airliner violating Siberian
                        airspace, the US passed a law making it a felony for anyone to give
                        assistance to another country that led to the shooting down of a civilian
                        plane.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Correct. That person was criminally liable, which meant we could not share
                    intel on the movement of narco aircraft to the Peruvians or anybody else. So
                    while we had the information, we could not do anything about it. Remember this
                    law was in reaction to a Russian, not US, shootdown of a civilian aircraft. We
                    had to change the law and it was changed. It said that there would be no
                    violation of law if the countries that received the information took certain
                    steps to determine to safeguard if they had the right aircraft in their sights
                    and to give the pilot a chance to identify himself and to land if instructed to
                    do so. Once that law was changed, which would have been at the end of 1994, we
                    were able to provide the Peruvians the information they needed. The program was
                    tremendously successful. It really changed the situation in Peru. As I said coca
                    production dropped seventy percent in about five years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we evaluate Fujimori at the time you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well a couple of things. He was no great friend of the United States.
                    Neither Al Adams nor his successor Dennis Jett had a relationship with him at
                    all. This was in large part because both were following instructions to push
                    strongly human rights issues. Fujimori basically cut off the American
                    Ambassador. However his ministers were willing to cooperate with us.</p>
                <p>Having said that, Fujimori was very successful in his early years in three
                    absolutely key areas: (1) He got a handle on the guerrilla insurgency, (2) His
                    political decision to use the Peruvian Air Force to intercept narco aircraft
                    produced a dramatic reduction in coca production; and (3) The economy boomed
                    while he was President. He strongly supported foreign investment in Peru. While
                    I was there the economy was growing eight, ten, twelve percent a year.</p>
                <p>There was a huge amount of economic growth and investment, mostly in mineral
                    extraction or energy. But you could see it. He also had a very strong work
                    ethic. He worked like crazy. I don't' know what he took but he had a huge amount
                    of energy; he was going all the time, up to the altiplano and back to the coast.
                    Huge altitude changes can be very fatiguing, but he did it all the time.</p>
                <p>He was very supportive of the poor. For example, he pushed electrification in
                    highland villages and in the pueblos jovenes, the shanty towns around Lima. You
                    could see things happening. He also was very supportive of legalizing the status
                    of the squatters who were putting up these shanty towns in he sand dunes around
                    Lima.. Those areas would be squatted upon by the people coming in from the
                    highlands, largely. He was very supportive of their getting services, and
                    getting legalized. Of course he had a dark side as well. His election to a third
                    term was questionable. But there is no question he won the first election and he
                    won the second election. No question about it. He won them going away.</p>

                <p>MACK: One last comment. As authoritative a figure as he undoubtedly was, if he
                    had left after his second term he would be a hero today. He probably could have
                    come back and gotten elected ten years later. But he just stayed on too long.
                    That is just sort of typical of many authoritarian people who believe they are
                    irreplaceable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we will talk about what was happening during the time

                        sounds like he was doing many of the right things? We will talk about that?
                        And any other things that were going on there. Maybe the business, the role

                <p>MACK: 1994 to 1997 in Peru.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So during that time how were we dealing with him? The good
                        points, the bad points and where were we standing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well! The mission had virtually no relationship with Fujimori as a person.
                    He was not predisposed to the United States. Both our Ambassadors, Al Adams and
                    Dennis Jett, early in their tenure, had forcefully expressed our human rights
                    concerns to Fujimori, regarding alleged government involvement with death squads
                    who had killed alleged leftists. That soured Fujimori on us so we did not deal
                    with the Fuji government at a Presidential level. The Ambassador met Fujimori
                    only when he was accompanying a high level visitor to call on the president. But
                    I cannot recall that either ambassador had direct talks with Fujimori during my
                    time, except to present credentials or escort a high level visitor, like the
                    head of ONDCP under Clinton, Gen Barry McCaffrey. We dealt with the Peruvian
                    government at the ministerial level. We did have access to the ministers and to
                    the military high command so we were able to get our work done. .</p>
                <p>The big issue was, of course, narcotics. Fujimori had come to the conclusion, I
                    think I spoke about this the last time we talked, that the narcotics trafficking
                    was fueling the two Peruvian insurgencies, the Sendero Luminoso and the MRTA, so
                    he made a commitment and decision early on to really go after the traffickers.
                    And I explained, I think, during our last conversation that he authorized the
                    use of deadly force to force down or shoot down narco aircraft who refused to
                    obey instructions to land. We had worked out the arrangements with Peru under
                    which we could share intelligence just prior to my arrival. I believe we
                    negotiated the deal with either the head of the Peruvian Air Force or Minister
                    of Defense. I can't recall.</p>
                <p>Under the agreement, the Peruvians had agreed to respect certain international
                    rules related to how you intercept civilian aircraft, in this case civilian
                    narcotics aircraft. You need to be aware that there were stringent requirements
                    in that regard. Unless the Peruvians met them, any US official who passed
                    information led to the loss of life could be criminally liable for murder.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>Prior to that time, a US person who shared information that led to loss of life
                    could be liable even if stringent safeguards were in place to avoid mistakes. So
                    obviously none shared information under those conditions. In any event the law
                    was changed; Fujimori agreed to follow strict intercept guidelines; and we began
                    to share intelligence on narco aircraft. As it turned out, most of the
                    information that the Peruvians used for intercepts they had gathered themselves
                    based on training and equipment we had given them. In a nutshell, they were able
                    to learn when the narcotics aircraft were coming and to what landing strip in
                    the Peruvian Amazon. As a result when the narco aircraft was landing or when it
                    was trying to take off with a load of drugs, it very frequently was intercepted
                    by a Peruvian Air Force plane, often a plane we had provided to them.</p>
                <p>The Peruvian Air Force was very successful in starting in '95 intercepting these
                    aircraft, very successful. And during for eighteen months or so I think there
                    twenty odd aircraft were shot down or shot up on the ground. I think of these
                    20, six or seven were actually shot down when they refused to land. Finally,
                    after about eighteen months, the first narco pilot agreed to land when
                    instructed to do so. It surprised me it took that long for those narco pilots to
                    come to the conclusion that if they did not land, the odds were very good they
                    would be shot down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the Peruvian Air Force flying for the
                        intercepts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: They were flying actually A-37's which we had given them. A-37s are very
                    old jet aircraft that only fly about 400 miles per hour. But that was fast
                    enough since they were dealing with narco aircraft flying at half that speed. We
                    had mounted F-16 radars on the front of the A-47s. In addition, we always sent
                    up a separate aircraft to monitor the situation and help the A-47s identify the
                    narco aircraft.</p>
                <p>It was only many years later that we had this horrific incident where the
                    Peruvian Air Force apparently didn't follow completely its own intercept
                    safeguards and ended up shooting down a missionary aircraft. This produced the
                    immediate suspension of all U.S. aerial intercept assistance to Peru.</p>
                <p>The Peruvians were not following their own guidelines; they were rushing through
                    the procedures. And in that particular case, the indications that the missionary
                    aircraft was a narco aircraft were not there. It was actually going into Peru,
                    not out of Peru . It was not varying its altitude. It was not trying to evade.
                    It was in broad-daylight. They didn't bother to check the tail number. Or at
                    least they had not gotten a response back before they opened fire. The
                    interceptor never established contact with the missionary plane. It is true that
                    narco pilots rarely acknowledge a request by the intercept aircraft to land. But
                    the narcos usually flew at night. There were a whole lot of signs that should
                    have told the Peruvian Air Force interceptors that the missionary aircraft was
                    not a narco aircraft. But anyway, that tragic incident ended the intercept
                    program in Peru. This occurred in 2001, four years after I left.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During that time basically the pilots were taking coca
                        out, was that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well they were not taking out the coca leaves; they were taking
                    semi-processed cocaine it was called “paste”, in its crudest form or “base”,
                    which is more processed, but still not cocaine HCL, the product sold in the
                    US.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The big money is not there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well the biggest money is not there. But certainly there is money there.
                    The farmers were not able to take it beyond paste or maybe base anyway. So they
                    took it that far. And you are absolutely right if you compare the price they
                    received for cocaine base in Peru to the wholesale price for cocaine HCL in the
                    United States; There was a huge difference. It was probably two or three percent
                    of the US wholesale value of cocaine. However, the buyer actually flew almost to
                    your door and you didn't have to hump it over the mountains to Lima. It was a
                    quite good deal for coca farmer as seen from his perspective. He wasn't really
                    comparing himself with the wholesaler in New York. He was comparing himself to
                    how well off he would have been if he were not growing coca.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MACK: This is a very broad question. I would not allege that narcotics penetrated
                    to the degree that it penetrated in Colombia. I think there was much greater
                    penetration in the Colombian Congress and Judiciary. But some military who
                    served in the jungle areas where narcotics were produced did become tainted to
                    some degree. There were cases where the Peruvian Army Officers were directly
                    involved with narcotic trafficking or protecting trafficking and being paid off
                    by them. I don't recall instances of members of the Peruvian Congress or
                    Legislators being involved. I don't recall that was the case. Fujimori worried
                    about that. He didn't want Peru to become another Colombia. That was often
                    discussed.</p>

                <p>MACK: I mean I can certainly imagine why it was. In some cases it was a judiciary
                    fearful to act because of the threat of retribution so that the bad guys walked.
                    In other cases the incompetence of the police, their inability to collect good
                    evidence, or maybe it did not exist. So it boiled down a feeling that from their
                    perspective there was no other way to go after these people successfully.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We first got into it in 1942.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Correct. I have now forgotten the precise history, but yes, there was a
                    dispute in 1942. There was another dust-up in the '50's or '60's. I can't recall
                    exactly when. But what happened in 1995 was that the Ecuadorians had much better
                    and easier physical access to the disputed area in the Sierra del Condor than
                    did the Peruvians. This area gets 200 inches of precipitation a year. The
                    terrain is very rough, mountainous. The forest is dense. The area is very
                    difficult to move through, extremely difficult, with no access roads except on
                    the Ecuadorian side. The access by the Ecuadorian side is not as precipitous so
                    they built roads up to the disputed area and constructed fortifications just
                    inside. This was just a way for the Ecuadorians to demonstrate their sovereignty
                    over the Amazon, because it was on the Amazon slope of the Andes. And at some
                    point the Peruvians noticed what they perceived was an Ecuadorian encroachment.
                    I can't exactly remember what it was. But the Ecuadorians expanded a little bit
                    farther than they had before, and the Peruvians caught on and told them to,
                    “Stop” The Ecuadorians would not leave so the Peruvian military was given the
                    order to oust them. And the Peruvians tried. They had to walk through fifty to
                    one hundred miles of mountainous terrain even to get to these little forts the
                    Ecuadorians had constructed, which were very close to Ecuadorian supply lines.
                    It was very, very difficult for the Peruvians. They had some minimum success at
                    first but the Ecuadorians held pretty fast. They had all the advantages of
                    terrain and supply. And to add to the Peruvians misery, the Ecuadorian Air Force
                    was flying cover over these areas and when the Peruvian Air Force attempted to
                    attack the Ecuadorian positions. The Ecuadorian's shot down, I think, a total of
                    about four or six Peruvian aircraft. Once again the Ecuadorian air base was much
                    closer to the front than the Peruvian base. The Peruvian pilots faced horrendous
                    weather in getting to the front whereas the Ecuadorians didn't because they
                    didn't have to fly over the rain forested mountains. So there was just a
                    horrible fight that was very, very damaging and very difficult for the
                    Peruvians. This was an extremely popular undertaking on the part of the
                    Ecuadorian military. For years every Ecuadorian school child was taught that
                    this was Ecuadorian territory and that the Ecuadorian army was simply attempting
                    to obtain what was rightfully Ecuador's.</p>

                <p>On the other hand Fujimori was not going to let Ecuador get away with it. And
                    therefore the war ensued. The war was really a series of skirmishes. I do not
                    know what the total death toll was but I imagine the its was in the hundreds
                    with many more wounded. There was a cease-fire. Luigi Einaudi, then I think US
                    Ambassador to the OAS, and who later became Assistant Secretary General of the
                    OAS, headed up a group to try to find a solution. It took over a year but they
                    did. Ecuador and Peru signed a Peace Agreement. I can't remember the date.</p>
                <p>I have an interesting story about the war. Our military attaches from the embassy
                    were prohibited from going up to anywhere near the war zone by their own
                    commander because of “force protection” concerns. Instead we sent up our
                    Political Counselor, not to the front line, but to Peru's forward staging area.
                    We had him there for two weeks. He would report back to us by satellite phone on
                    what was going on. It was ironic that the military was not allowed to go so we
                    had to send our political counselor, a civilian. Sometimes the US military
                    imposes tighter restrictions on its people that we civilians. They were very
                    frustrated. It was a difficult time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we trying to prevent Peru, which got its nose
                        bloodied at the Sierra del Condor, from attacking somewhere else? After all,
                        Peru is a bigger country with greater military potential than Ecuador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Correct, yes. We particularly feared that since the Peruvians were at a
                    tactical disadvantage where the war was actually being fought, they might attack
                    somewhere else where they would have an advantage. We worried that they would go
                    up the Pacific coast and try to take Guayaquil. Fortunately, the war ended
                    before that happened. But it was a pretty tense two weeks.</p>
                <p>And, of course Fujimori went up to the war zone and walked around the jungle with
                    his troops. Those were the days when Fuji was riding very, very high. He was
                    seen as personally leading the defense of Peruvian sovereignty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it playing in Peru at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well it, I think the overwhelming majority of the Peruvian populace
                    supported what it saw as Peru's effort to defend its natural territory. We could
                    hardly really take sides. We just wanted the two sides to stop and work out an
                    agreement. Remember we had military missions on both sides. And we were in
                    contact with the military on both sides. Our desire was to foster some sort of
                    cease-fire.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was having an interview with Les Alexander who was in
                        Ecuador during he war. He was having a hard time with Ecuadorian military.
                        He kept telling them that they were poking at a much bigger tiger than they
                        were and urging not to do it..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: The Ecuadorians were pretty full of themselves, I am sure. They were able
                    to successfully hold off the Peruvians in that particular part of the country.
                    But that didn't mean they could hold them off in the coastal area where it would
                    be much easier to run tanks across.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a democracy? Was Fujimori a product of
                        democracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Fujimori was popularly elected in his first and second terms, of that I
                    have no doubt. I was there for his election the second time around. When he was
                    elected for the first time, the traditional political parties were held in very
                    low repute. And people basically elected the pig, if you know what I mean.
                    Anybody but! He ran as the anti-establishment candidate. And the populace was so
                    upset with the traditional parties that they wanted to turn to something new. In
                    a sense that is what they did in the case of Chavez in Venezuela.</p>
                <p>So, yes he did quite well in his first term. He began to get a handle on the
                    insurgency and the economy was going up. In his second term he began to get a
                    handle on the drug situation. So he was riding very high. He was very active in
                    carrying out projects of electrification in the highlands and legalizing
                    shantytowns being built outside of Lima. He spent a lot of time with poor
                    people. So he was quite popular with them. He still is quite popular with those
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He is sitting in Chile now waiting to make a major
                        comeback?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: He has lost that opportunity because he lost his appeal to run for
                    president. He is not going to be allowed to go to Peru. His time to inscribe
                    himself as a candidate has now expired. This time around he will not be allowed
                    to run as President. So he is out of it. So basically his gambit failed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were there how did the government
                        relate to the economy and with different things American?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>MACK: Would you believe that they were very, very supportive of foreign
                    investment. The vast majority of the huge projects were aimed at minerals or
                    hydrocarbons. Peru is very, very rich in all sorts of minerals and agreements
                    were signed with quite a few foreign firms of various nationalities. Then also
                    the Camisea gas project went out for bid. That was a huge project. So yes, there
                    was a rush of foreign investment which produced very rapid economic growth.
                    Unfortunately, mining does not create a lot of employment. It is highly capital
                    intensive. So there was still a major unemployment problem. Peru is still Peru.
                    But the investment situation improved tremendously. And the Economic situation
                    improved.</p>
                <p>The one question you did not ask me about was the famous takeover of the Japanese
                    Ambassadors residence by the MRTA guerrilla group in December of 1996 on the
                    Emperor's Birthday in somewhere around December 11th or 12th. For the Japanese,
                    the Emperor's Birthday is equivalent to the 4th of July. And as far as the
                    Japanese are concerned, with Fujimori being of Japanese origin, that event took
                    on a greater import in Peru. The Japanese Ambassador, who was a good friend, had
                    invited the who's who of Peru. In addition to the diplomatic corps and 20
                    ambassadors, you had the captains industry, plus all the senior people in the
                    military, the cabinet, the congress, the supreme court, something like 700
                    guests in all. At about 8:30 an explosion ripped open the wall behind the garden
                    where the reception was being held. The charge had been placed by the MRTA, the
                    more orthodox of Peru's two guerrilla groups, with links to most of the other
                    movements in Latin America. 14 armed MRTA guerrillas charged through the hole in
                    into the reception. They essentially held Peru in their thrall for four months
                    and ten days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there Americans in there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes, there were I think twelve American Embassy people were taken hostage.
                    I was not one of them, I had just left along with the Ambassador Jett very early
                    in the evening because his mother and my son were flying in for the Christmas
                    holidays and we both had to go to the airport. And six minutes after I left I
                    heard an explosion followed by machine gun fire. I lived about six blocks away.
                    At the time I was not particularly concerned about it because we did hear this
                    kind of thing from time to time. My wife insisted that I check with the Marine
                    Security Guards, who had just received word that these guys had busted into the
                    Japanese Ambassador's residence. Once they were inside, the walls around the
                    residence became the defensive barriers for the terrorists. All the armed
                    security guards who were supposed to be protecting the VIPs were stuck outside
                    the walls and there was nothing they could do.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>Think about the situation for a moment. There were 700 people inside the spacious
                    grounds of the Japanese Ambassador's residence all dressed up in their finery
                    frantically making their cell phone calls. After about 4 hours, the guerrillas
                    let all the women go, including one of my political officers, who came back and
                    described all of this to me. The MRTA guerrillas did this for practical reasons.
                    They realized they simply could not handle 700 hostages. Food would have been an
                    issue. Sanitation. So they got rid of that group and through periodic releases
                    over several weeks whittled down the numbers to about seventy some odd, which
                    they held on to until the end. For reasons that I still do not fully understand,
                    the guerillas made a decision not to keep any Americans long term. All were
                    freed within a week. Maybe they did not want to engage America head on on this.
                    Maybe, the decision was not pick a fight against the United States or cause a
                    big problem. But they let the Americans go fairly quickly, although the week
                    they were held captive was hell for their families and stressful for all of
                    us.</p>
                <p>Among the 700 they initially took hostage, were about twenty ambassadors. They
                    gradually release all of them as well, except the Bolivian ambassador Jorge
                    Gumucio. And the reason they held Gumucio was because the Bolivian government
                    had jailed one of their comrades in Bolivia and had refused to release him. From
                    the Japanese Ambassador's residence, the head of the MRTA group issued his
                    demands, which was for the release of four hundred MRTA prisoners the Peruvian
                    government was holding. He actually presented a list with the names of the 400.
                    By the way the American woman Lori Berenson was near the top of the list.</p>
                <p>So Fuji was faced with complying with that demand or risking a really nasty
                    outcome. But it was clear Fujimori felt that for a Peruvian President to release
                    the imprisoned guerrillas after all these years of fighting would have been a
                    gesture of surrender of sovereignty. He would have lost any credibility that he
                    had as a President. And we all know that Fujimori, if anything, was into
                    defending power. There was no way he was going to release them .</p>
                <p>And the guerillas made a whole lot of mistakes. The biggest one was that
                    throughout the 4 month standoff with the Peruvian government, the MRTA never
                    relaxed its initial demand that the government release all four hundred MRTA
                    prisoners on the list . Not that Fujimori would have honored an agreement to let
                    a few guerrillas go. But, they never even put Fuji in that situation where he
                    had to decide whether to free a smaller number of the guerillas in exchange for
                    freedom of the hostages. They never put Fuji to the test in that regard. Can you
                    imagine a similar hostage situation in the United States in which a sitting
                    president would agree to free four hundred terrorists in exchange for some high
                    level people held hostage? No President can do that and retain creditability;
                    and it would be an impeachable offense even in Peru. It was not in Fujimori's
                    nature anyway. So while negotiations were going, Fujimori was busily assembling
                    his Commandos and retaining some Israeli experts to advise or train the
                    Peruvians how to carry out assault on the Japanese Ambassador's residence to
                    free the hostages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would he have turned to us to help him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>MACK: To my knowledge he never asked us for help directly. We did have an intel
                    relationship with the Peruvians and did cooperate in important ways during the
                    hostage crisis. But Fujimori never once acknowledged our assistance when I was
                    there even to senior visiting US officials when given an opening to do so. He
                    did not want to admit we had helped. And he fact was the US did not plan, train
                    the Peruvians for, or participate in the raid that freed the hostages. That was
                    Fujimori's doing. He brought indigenous miners in from the highlands to tunnel
                    under the residence from outside the walls, and of course he brought in the
                    Israelis to help train his commandos. The tunneling was a slow, painstaking
                    process. To mask the noise, the Peruvians played the loud-speakers they had
                    placed outside the walls at a very high volume. The tunneling and the
                    preparation of the commando attack took a fair amount of time, but at some point
                    I guess his people came to him and said, “okay, Mr. President we are ready”. And
                    they had placed explosives right under the floor of the living room of the
                    residence. They detonated these explosives there and in several other places and
                    the commandos rushed in. They were actually able to free all the hostages but
                    one got caught in the crossfire in the escape and was killed. He was a well
                    respected Supreme Court Justice. The Foreign Minister, also a hostage, was
                    wounded in the leg.</p>
                <p>In the end some of the guerrillas may have suffered from I guess what you would
                    call a reverse Stockholm syndrome in that at least one of them had sufficiently
                    bonded with the hostages so that he was unwilling to follow his standing orders
                    to execute them if there was a rescue attempt.. He just couldn't do it. Some
                    guerrillas were killed outright when the explosion went off under the living
                    room where they were playing soccer in the living room. But most were not killed
                    in the initial blast.. One or two of them simply refused to kill the hostages.
                    And it was over very, very quickly, maybe a couple of minutes. No guerrillas
                    survived and I will leave it to you to imagine how that could possibly happen.
                    But in the end Fujimori won a tremendous victory. During the hostage crisis the
                    whole country was hanging on every moment. The government was paralyzed. Nothing
                    was happening. Imagine. A senior intelligence officer was a hostage, a senior
                    naval and army officer, Supreme Court Justices and Ministers. There was just an
                    amazing number of high level Peruvians held hostage.</p>
                <p>So that was another huge victory for Fujimori. But I want to tell you that when
                    the hostages were taken, which included I think 12 US Embassy people, the US
                    very quickly sent down a special crisis task force. And I think it is a great
                    credit to the Embassy to be able to organize itself successfully to deal with
                    the crisis with the help of the people who came in. The folks who came in were
                    very competent but some were also very strong willed. However, we were able to
                    successfully integrate them into the country team, and there was very little
                    friction.</p>
                <p>And during that whole period, which was four months and ten days, this task
                    force, worked successfully to coordinate all information that we were able to
                    acquire and do whatever needed to be done to help ensure a positive outcome.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the group that was holding the hostages have much
                        communication with the outside or were all their eggs in one basket?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: To my knowledge, if the guerrillas were able to communicate with the
                    outside, it was minimal. This was because one of the first things that the
                    Peruvian government did was to totally cut them off, isolate them. They were
                    forced to live in a bubble. And because of this, the MRTA leader may have
                    developed an unrealistic understanding of how strong the cards he was holding
                    were or were not. Or maybe he was just stubborn or had an inflated view of his
                    power. He showed no flexibility at all. I am not saying that ultimately he would
                    not have been undone in any event, but his inflexibility assured an outcome that
                    was disastrous for him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, was the young American woman associated with
                        this group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Yes, directly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can imagine that you found it hard to feel sympathetic
                        towards her. During the time you were there, how were you dealing with
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well, here is a little bit of a background. As I told you last time, one
                    year exactly before the takeover of the Japanese Ambassador's residence, the
                    same group had been plotting, and was within a day or two of an attempt, to take
                    over the entire Peruvian Congress. They had brought in something like forty-five
                    guerillas from their operations in the Amazon, mostly Amazonian types who were
                    totally alien to Lima, and housed them in a toney Lima suburb where, by the way,
                    some of our people lived and who witnessed what I am going tell you.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>The house where they were staying had been rented for this group by Lori
                    Berenson. She rented it, she and a Panamanian. I saw a copy of the rental
                    document. The two were foreign internationalista revolutionaries who had come to
                    Peru to support the MRTA. Berenson and the Panamanian rented the property for
                    the MRTA. And I understood that she actually lived there with her boyfriend who
                    was one of the leaders the assault group that was going to attempt to take over
                    the Peruvian Congress. Berenson had come to Peru posing as a journalist for the
                    “Third World Press” of from Brooklyn, New York. I think the Third World Press
                    was just a front. She had just left an interview in the Congress with a female
                    Peruvian Congresswomen named Townsend on what was it like to be a female in a
                    predominantly male Congress. Berenson was picked up by the police shortly after
                    interview getting on a bus, along with the wife of the MRTA leader. The leader
                    himself happened not be in Lima at that moment so was not arrested with the
                    others. The reason that the government found out about this plot was that
                    apparently someone in the neighborhood reported an enormous amount of bread
                    being delivered regularly to this upper middle-class house. Clearly the food
                    deliveries were a lot more than one would expect for a family of four. The fact
                    is they were a family of forty-five. The police surrounded the place. When they
                    realized what they were dealing with, they called the army for backup . A
                    shoot-out ensued. A few guerrillas were killed but most of them were arrested.
                    Berenson had been arrested near the Congress shortly before the shootout so was
                    not at the house at the time. In the house the police found automatic weapons
                    and Peruvian Military Police uniforms. The also found somewhere a truck painted
                    to look like an army vehicle. The group was clearly ready to go. Their audacious
                    plan probably would have worked if their staging house had not been
                    discovered.</p>
                <p>Three or four months later — at that point Berenson was in jail — a videotape was
                    sent to a Lima TV station which it played on the air. The video showed the head
                    of the organization standing in front of a black curtain with the insignia of
                    his group. In front of him was a mockup of the Peruvian Congress. He proceeded
                    to explain exactly how the take over was going to take place. He said, in
                    effect, you caught us this time but we will be back. And exactly one year to the
                    day, they were back and successfully took over the Japanese Ambassador's
                    residence during the reception in honor of the Japanese Emperors' birthday. The
                    residence was a large walled property. One three of its four sides, the walls
                    bordered directly on the street. On the fourth side, a row of houses sat between
                    the wall on the street. One of those houses was rented from someone from the
                    German Aid Mission who happened to be on vacation. It was through that house,
                    the guerrillas gained access to the one residence wall sheltered from the
                    street. Several days before the attack, the guerrillas showed up in a ambulance.
                    They took the house guard prisoner and went inside, set up and waited for the
                    big reception. As the reception got under way, they placed an explosive against
                    the wall, set it off, ran through the hole, and took 700 stunned guests people
                    hostage. It was very well executed. Anyway your question was how did we deal
                    with Lori Berenson.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>By way of background, Berenson had dropped out of MIT as a sophomore. Apparently
                    she had been radicalized while in El Salvador on vacation when she stayed with a
                    family of guerrilla sympathizers. That is what I understood. She later married,
                    and I think then divorced, a Sandinista from Nicaragua. During the El Salvador
                    peace negotiations, in 1989 I think, Berenson, apparently unbeknownst to the
                    USG, actually served as a secretary to the head of one of the FMLN guerrilla
                    groups which were then negotiating a peace deal with the government of El
                    Salvador to end th war. She actually sat in on the negotiations as notetaker for
                    the guerrillas. But at the time the US did not know she was an American. Her
                    role with the Salvadoran guerrillas only came to light after she was arrested in
                    Peru in 1995. I am just speculating here, but putting two and two together, it
                    was probably because of her impeccable revolutionary credentials in Central
                    America that she gained entire to the MRTA in Peru. You need to understand that
                    most Latin American revolutionary groups like the MRTA had very close ties with
                    each other. They fought in each others insurgencies. I don't know if you were
                    aware of this but they did. I recall that there were Peruvians were fighting
                    with the FMLN in El Salvador when I was assigned here. Berenson must have gotten
                    an introduction to the MRTA and agreed to do some logistical work for them.</p>
                <p>Berenson's parents were very concerned that she had been arrested. They were very
                    well educated people from New York. I think her father was a professor of
                    statistics, and her mother a Physics Professor. I met with them I think twice.
                    They just could not believe and refused to accept that their daughter would be
                    involved in any terrorist acts. They probably still don't believe it to this
                    day. To them, she just wanted to help the poor and oppressed. Berenson's parents
                    came to Peru very frequently to visit her, and while there met with Ambassador
                    Jett and me, I think twice. Our head consul regularly trekked up to the
                    altiplano to visit Berenson at a prison over 14,000 feet above sea level and
                    deliver food, clothes and vitamins, which she shared with her fellow
                    revolutionaries. However, she was at that particular prison by her own choice
                    because her boyfriend was in the same jail. Finally she agreed to be transferred
                    down to a prison at a lower altitude. I still think she is in jail to this
                    day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think so too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: And this despite a lot of pressure from the United States on the Peruvian
                    Government to release her. You would be amazed and dismayed to learned some of
                    the sources. But neither the Peruvian government nor the Peruvian people felt
                    very sympathetic to foreigners who came in to support insurgencies that went on
                    for 20 years and produced 20,000 dead. And the Fujimori government was not about
                    to give in to pressure to release somebody simply because she was an American.
                    Now, her parents insisted all along that she was innocent. Moreover, her first
                    trial was judged by international observers not to meet internationally
                    recognize standards of justice. So she was tried again and convicted again. She
                    has been in jail for over ten years, long after Fujimori left office.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>But what I want to tell you is, the U. S. position always was to insist Berenson
                    receive fair treatment and a fair trial regardless of what she may or may not
                    have done. And, of course, she was entitled to and received consular
                    representation and regular consular visits. And we went out of our way to
                    provide her first class consular protection in every aspect. When I was there, a
                    consul would visit her every month.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the Consular Officers' impressions of how she
                        was doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: They found her very strong willed and utterly committed to the
                    revolutionary cause. They respected her commitment, not her position. But the
                    fact is that this was not a person who ever repented for what she had done or
                    ever disavowed her group for that matter. She was an extremely, extremely
                    committed person. By the time I left there had been no change in that at
                    all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there were there any problems with Bolivia
                        or with Chile at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Between Peru and Chile? I don't recall any major problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any old issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: The big issue was the border dispute with Ecuador when I was there. You are
                    referring to the War of the Pacific 130 years ago when Bolivia lost its seacoast
                    to Chile and Peru lost about 200 miles of coast, also to Chile. But I did not
                    see the effort by Peru to reopen that issue while I was here. Bolivia is another
                    matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any fishing problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I don't recall any fishing problems. You are referring to the 200 Mile
                    Sovereignty Zone off the coast. The world came to accept the concept of a 200
                    mile economic zone but not 200 mile sovereign zone. Before I arrived the
                    Peruvian Air Force shot at a US C-130 on an counter narcotics mission over what
                    we considered international waters, killing a member of the crew. The plane had
                    been flying over Peruvian air space but at the time of the attack was well off
                    the coast about 60 miles off he coast. The C-130 had refused the interceptors'
                    order to land in Peru. Worse still, the Peruvian pilot was actually decorated
                    for his heroic act against an unarmed aircraft. That certainly produced some
                    bitterness on our part. But that incident was no longer a hot issue when I was
                    there. That happened earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well was there anything else that came during your time in
                        Peru?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>MACK: Three months before I arrived, a car bomb placed in front of the old
                    embassy downtown had killed two local guards and blown out most of the front
                    fa�ade of the embassy. One year after I arrived we moved into our new embassy.
                    This was a long awaited and welcomed move, but also very complicated. And, of
                    course when you are a DCM, there are things you have to do. One thing is
                    negotiate space arrangements for the various sections and agencies in the
                    Embassy. And of course people are very territorial. But actually the move worked
                    quite well. It really did. I would not call the new embassy beautiful, but it
                    was imposing, interesting and very secure.</p>
                <p>One problem we had to deal with was that the design for the new embassy compound
                    did not envision any exercise facilities for the 650 people who were working
                    there. Now in any Federal facility, and especially one that was a danger post,
                    you would expect people to be given a place on the premises to exercise. We are
                    supposed to encourage our employees to be healthy. And because of certain
                    security restrictions, there were not a whole lot of places you could jog around
                    Lima at the time. It was dangerous. The compound consisted of I think 18 acres,
                    which is pretty good sized. There was open space. So we thought why not find a
                    way to put in some exercise facilities . We had all of these military personnel,
                    a lot of them on TDY, who wanted a place to exercise. The Admin Counselor was a
                    very astute fellow and when we put our heads together, we realized there was a
                    line item in the construction budget for the embassy called “site work”.
                    Basically it was to pay to clean up after a major construction project. With
                    those funds, I think something like $70,000, we built a really nice soccer field
                    that is there to this day, along with two tennis courts, and a basketball court.
                    Plus we were able to fix a little space in an out building for a gym that we
                    bequeath to the incoming generation of embassy, all of which are still there and
                    used to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a good place to stop! And we will pick this up in
                        1997 and where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I went to Guyana as Ambassador</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay we will pick it up then. Today is 20th of February
                        2006. Jim, you are off to Guyana, 1997?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: That is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that appointment come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>MACK: Well, that was the year in which President Clinton had named a fairly high
                    number of political appointees to fill ambassadorial openings in Latin America.
                    If I remember correctly, there were only two or three posts filled by career
                    people. Georgetown, Guyana was one of them and I was lucky enough to get an
                    appointment..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you served in Guyana from '97 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: To 2000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Guyana as you got ready to go
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well an election was coming up and the situation was getting fairly tense,
                    with racial overtones. Janet Jagan was the presidential candidate of the ruling
                    People's Progressive Party, or PPC, which was Marxist Leninist, and Desmond
                    Hoyte was the candidate of the opposition party, the People's National Congress
                    known as the PNC, which had largely shed its Marxist ideology and had evolved
                    into a more moderate party.</p>
                <p>Since most people know much about Guyana, let me give you a bit of background.
                    Guyana achieved independence in 1966. About 10 years prior to that, the main
                    pro-independence party, which was a Marxist party, had largely split in two
                    along racial lines between the two largest Guyanese ethnic groups. The group
                    headed by Forbes Burnham, a British educated barrister was predominantly
                    Afro-Guyanese. The other group, headed by Dr. Cheddi Jagan, a US trained
                    dentist, was predominantly Indo-Guyanese, that is to say comprised of
                    descendants of indentured servants who had been brought to Guyana from the
                    Indian subcontinent in the mid-1800s replace the African slaves on the
                    plantations after slavery was abolished in the British empire.</p>

                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>MACK: His wife, Janet Rosenberg Jagan, was born an American in the mid-west, I
                    think in Chicago, and had met him when he was studying dentistry at Northwestern
                    University just north of the city. In any event, Cheddi had largely built the
                    independence struggle in Guyana. A peaceful struggle I might note. It was
                    basically based on his support from labor unions, especially the sugar cane
                    workers, most of whom were Indo-Guyanese. In fact Jagan's father was a foreman
                    on a sugar plantation and Jagan was raise on one. But the problem for the
                    British, who wanted to extricate itself from Guyana, was that Jagan was an
                    avowed Marxist-Leninist. At the time of independence, the British and Americans
                    were very concerned that Guyana would be the first country, at least in the
                    British Empire, to achieve independence under a Marxist Government. So they
                    changed the electoral system to require that the party or coalition of parties
                    winning the presidency be backed by an absolute majority of the seats in the
                    parliament. The idea was that the parties representing the non-IndoGuyanese
                    groups, who together formed a slight majority of the population, would join
                    together to defeat Jagan. Even though the two main parties were Marxist, Jagan
                    at the time was considered more extreme, and therefore the greater evil.</p>
                <p>The electoral change produced the intended result, at least in the beginning.
                    Forbes Burnham and his largely Afro-Guyanese party called the Peoples National
                    Congress or PNC forged an alliance with a party with strong support form
                    Guyana's Portuguese, Chinese and Amerindian population, plus some non-Marxist
                    Indo-Guyanese businessmen. As a consequence it was Burnham, not Jagan, who won
                    the election and therefore it was Burnham, not Jagan, who became independent
                    Guyana's post colonial leader. However, in the end things did not work out as
                    the British had hoped. Burnham himself proceeded to move farther to the left and
                    ended up nationalizing something like 85 percent of the economy - the bauxite
                    mines, the sugar industry, the rice industry. Even relatively small businesses
                    were nationalized. Of Guyana's large enterprises only the Coca-Coca franchise
                    escaped nationalization. Burnham's actions destroyed the economy and
                    impoverished the country, spurring massive migration abroad of Guyana's
                    population — to the US, Canada, the UK, the Caribbean, Venezuela — to the point
                    where today at least as many Guyanese and their descendants live outside of
                    Guyana as inside. Despite a relatively high birth rate, the country's population
                    has not significantly changed in 40 years. This is almost unheard of in a third
                    world country and gives an idea of how bad the situation there became.</p>
                <p>In any event, Burnham was reelected several times, almost certainly the result of
                    fraud. Early on in his reign, he basically told the other ethnic groups that had
                    supported his election in 1966 that he didn't need them any more, didn't want
                    them in Guyana, and that if they were unhappy they should leave the country.
                    Most of the Chinese and Portuguese Guyanese did just that, largely to Canada.
                    Finally in the mid 80s, I think around 1985, Burnham, a heavy smoker, and sick
                    with lung cancer, died on an operating table. His attending surgeon was Cuban.
                    At that point, the Soviet Union, his main benefactor, was not doing very well
                    either so Guyana too was at a dead end.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>His successor Desmond Hoyte also was a British trained barrister and had been in
                    Burnham's cabinet for years. Given the ethnic composition of the country,
                    Hoyte's subsequent electoral victory in 1985 also almost certainly came about as
                    a result of fraud, but he turned out to be much more moderate and proceeded to
                    start to open up the economy.</p>
                <p>When the Soviet Union finally collapsed, the world changed radically for Guyana.
                    After a couple of failed attempts, Jimmy Carter convinced Desmond Holt to allow
                    an internationally supervised election when he ran for reelection in 1990 or
                    '91. Cheddi Jagan ran again and this time he won. His election was basically due
                    to demographics. The Indo-Guyanese population remained greater than the
                    Afro-Guyanese population. And people tend to vote along racial lines. In fact,
                    the editor of the country's largest newspaper once described elections in Guyana
                    as “a racial census” So Cheddi, a declared Marxist-Leninist, a faithful friend
                    of the former Soviet Union, who for 30 years vacationed on the Black Sea a guest
                    of the Soviet state, finally became President.</p>
                <p>But he was elected after the fall of the Soviet Union, and was simply unable to
                    do a lot of things that he otherwise might have wanted to do. Also, Burnham had
                    already tried those things they had failed utterly. They bankrupted the country
                    and reduced it from the ranks of a middle income nation at the time of
                    independence to a country only a notch above Haiti in terms of their per capita
                    income. As a consequence, Jagan did not attempt to reverse Hoyte's economic
                    openings, but did little to deepen them either.</p>
                <p>Four years into his presidency, Jagan suffered a heart attack. Unlike his
                    predecessor, he was offered US medical treatment by the US Government a gesture
                    which he and Janet Jagan appreciated. In fact, the US Air Force flew him to
                    Walter Reed medical center for treatment, giving him the royal, or I should say
                    presidential treatment. No Cuban doctors for him. Unfortunately, he succumbed a
                    few weeks later to another massive heart attack, without finishing his term. The
                    ruling party named an Afro-Guyanese member of a small coalition partner of
                    Jagan's party to finish it out. When Jagan's party could not agree on a
                    successor, it turned to Jagan's widow Janet Rosenberg Jagan as the party's
                    presidential candidate in 1997. Desmond Hoyte was her opponent, just as he had
                    been her husband's opponent in 1991.</p>
                <p>Janet Jagan was a well known figure in Guyana, a major political power in her own
                    right, one of the principal founders of the ruling party, and for years the real
                    organizational force in the PPC party. There were some interesting comparisons
                    to a prominent US power couple in the US at that time and now. Janet also was
                    demonized by Hoyte and his party. Hoyte's campaign was very strident with racial
                    overtones. When Janet Jagan was declared the winner, which was inevitable given
                    the racial makeup of Guyana, things got out of hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>MACK: This was December of 1997. At that point, the Afro-Guyanese population was
                    largely urbanized or lived near the capital, and formed the absolute majority in
                    the capital of Georgetown. When Janet was elected, Hoyte repeatedly claimed
                    massive fraud. It did not matter that OAS and other outside observers did not
                    detect any significant fraud. Afro-Guyanese anger boiled over into rioting and
                    arson. They just could not accept that the PPC had won reelection. Cheddi they
                    had some affection for, but not Janet.</p>
                <p>I won't say was situation was totally out of control but it was very, very
                    serious leading CARICOM, the economic association of the English speaking
                    countries in the Caribbean, to intervene and broker discussions between the two
                    parties which led to an uneasy truce that allowed Janet Jagan to take office.
                    Things had been so bad that Janet was hastily sworn in at the presidential
                    residence. And I do not believe Hoyte or his party attended the opening ceremony
                    at of the newly elected National Congress. Things were that tense. By the way
                    the Canadian ambassador, the British high commissioner and I worked with a
                    highly respected, and politically independent Afro-Guyanese figure behind the
                    scenes with CARICOM to urge Hoyte to accept the election results and tell his
                    followers to cease their violence.</p>
                <p>However, even after the deal, tensions remained high, with the danger of things
                    getting out of hand at any moment. After about a year of this, President Janet
                    Jagan decided to step down on the grounds that she had some heart condition. She
                    was well into her 70s at that point, but always struck me as healthy and
                    vigorous. By the way, I found her very approachable and plain speaking with a
                    typical mid-western manner, even though she always retained her communist
                    beliefs.</p>
                <p>In any event, she decided, ostensibly for health reasons, to step down. I think
                    the real reason was the constant tension with the opposition with the
                    Afro-Guyanese Party., constantly. She knew she was a red flag to the opposition.
                    In fact, every little issue tended to blow-up into some sort of strife. Labor
                    strife or strife from the street. And so, she decided to step down. In her place
                    the People's Progressive Party Central Committee named Bharrat Jagdeo to finish
                    her term. Jagdeo was a very bright Soviet trained economist of Indo-Guyanese
                    origin. I think he was in his mid or late 30s at the time. He had received his
                    Master's Degree in Economics from Patricio Lumumba University in Moscow along
                    about the time that the Soviet Union was collapsing. Jagdeo was from a small
                    village up the coast from the capital. Years before, the Jagans had identified
                    him as a young man with great leadership promise and had overseen his education
                    and development. The Jagans brought along other young people in party in the
                    same way, like Jagdeo, and eventually sent them off to the Soviet Union for an
                    education. My guess is that they were grooming Jagdeo for the presidency after
                    Cheddi Jagan had hopefully finished two terms so in a sense his assumption of
                    power was premature but inevitable.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>When Jagdeo returned to Guyana after his Soviet education, he was given a senior
                    position in the Ministry of Finance and eventually becoming the Minister. I met
                    with him in that capacity and later as president. I found him much less
                    ideological than Janet Jagan. Must have been something about the water in Moscow
                    since he was there when the Soviet Union collapsed.</p>
                <p>I think the party's choice in naming him to finish Janet's term was excellent. I
                    found him pragmatic person, and very, very approachable. When he was president,
                    I was able to get right to the point with him, walk through all the issues and
                    reach conclusions. That was his style. By the way, when Janet Jagan was
                    president, she was always available to see me, unlike the Foreign Minister,
                    Clement Rohee, a party loyalist, who avoided me for months at a time even when I
                    issues important to both our countries to discuss. My guess is that he was under
                    the thrall of regime on a bid island off the coast of Florida. A couple of times
                    I went to President Jagan directly to complain about the Foreign Minister and
                    got what I thought was a very fair hearing.</p>
                <p>In any event, that was the situation I walked into. A country that had suffered
                    grievously, through because of Marxist economic policies over the preceding
                    thirty years, a country that had fallen from the ranks of a promising mid-level
                    developing country to one that was just about at the bottom of the scale for the
                    Western Hemisphere next to Haiti. A country that had been hemorrhaging its
                    people, including the best and brightest for over a generation!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were the Guyanese people going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: They were mainly going to New York and Toronto. But a lot of educated
                    Guyanese were going to the English speaking Caribbean countries, most of which
                    were substantially better off economically. Many Caribbean Island States needed
                    skilled people - doctors, nurses, school teaches judges etc. Even Botswana was
                    recruiting Guyanese teachers and nurses . Botswana was short on qualified
                    English-speaking teachers and had the money to pay. So they sought them in a
                    much poorer country. The impact of these losses on Guyana, year after year was
                    very high. Even with several years of growth in the late 80s after Hoyte become
                    president and, Guyana was still losing its best and brightest all over the
                    world. Needless to say, when I got to Georgetown, the lines outside the Embassy
                    consular section were pretty long. One of the first things I did was to set up
                    an appointment system for non-immigrant visa interviews, which ended the problem
                    of lines.</p>
                <p>But it was pretty disconcerting when I first arrived, to see lines of people
                    sweltering in the sun and dripping in sweat waiting to get an interview on the
                    chance that they might be allowed to enter the United States on a tourist visa
                    so they could overstay remain in the United States illegally.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>But that was the situation in Guyana. We were trying to encourage the private
                    sector. We had training programs to help to private sector organizations develop
                    some economical analysis capability so they could make constructive sound
                    economic policies proposals to the government.</p>
                <p>One of the consequences of Guyana's massive out migration was that they had bled
                    so much of its human talent that the government found it very difficult to staff
                    itself adequately. There were simply not enough skilled people around in the
                    country to do all the things that needed to be done. There was a very small,
                    very thin veneer of extraordinarily, able well educated people. But many of them
                    were over 50 years old at that point. They had been educated under the British
                    system, and for one reason or another they had stayed in Guyana and actually
                    succeeded despite the economic situation. Others had gone to work for
                    international organizations; some became international consultants; some where
                    in the private sector, so there was a small group of really stimulating people.
                    Many became wonderful friends. Others would come back to Guyana to visit family
                    — like university professors in the United States, judges in Antigua or the
                    Bahamas or teachers and etc. Others would be working for the UN. The number
                    still living in Guyana was very small. So it made it very difficult for a
                    private company or the government to move ahead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel in talking to your predecessors who
                        had been there that these socialist or Marxists governments were essentially
                        driving people away. It seemed to be a deliberate policy. Did they
                        understand what they were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I think Forbes Burnham knew exactly what he was doing back in the late 60s
                    and 70s. I think he felt he could consolidate and maintain power by driving away
                    those people. His successor and fellow PNC party member Desmond Hoyte tried to
                    move the government back to the center. Hoyte had reprivatized a couple of
                    significant businesses and was trying to attract foreign enterprise to come back
                    to Guyana. And he had some success, but when the country started to grow again,
                    it was from a very low base. And while Cheddi Jagan did not welcome these policy
                    changes, which occurred before he took office, he did not really attempt to
                    reverse them. On the other hand, he did not have much of a choice because at
                    that point, he had nobody else to turn to. No socialist country was around to
                    bail him out. Remember Forbes Burnham had received significant assistance from
                    the Soviets and from Cuba during a number of years. But those sources had dried
                    up. So Guyana had nowhere else to go.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>MACK: Cheddi Jagan had died 6 months before I arrived. And I never had an
                    ideological conversation with Janet Jagan. We are talking about a fully formed
                    person her mid-70s who had worked on behalf of her Marxist beliefs her entire
                    adult life. I just don't think that kind of conversation would have been
                    productive. My guess is that she would have blamed Guyana's problem on the
                    excesses and corruption of the Burnham government, not on any basic flaws in
                    Marxist thought. I did make a number of speeches on the importance of free
                    enterprise, foreign and domestic private investment, open markets, and less
                    restrictive regulatory regimes to Guyana's economic development, but my focus
                    was on the business community.</p>
                <p>I do remember once that I had an informal conversation with one of the top
                    leaders of Jagan's PPC party right after the Fifteenth Party Congress. I had run
                    into him at a cocktail party. The newspapers had reported his speech stating the
                    ruling party's “unswerving commitment to Marxist Leninist principles.” We had
                    always been friendly so I went up to him and in the course of our conversation,
                    referred to his remarks, and said bluntly “you don't really still believe that
                    stuff do you.” His response was in a serious but friendly tone. “Oh! Absolutely
                    I believe it” he said. We are committed to this. Basically, our time will come.”
                    I was a bit surprised, but he was being very serious, not hostile at all but
                    serious. That was world view of those of his generation in the party leadership.
                    These folks were in their fifties or up at that time.</p>
                <p>The party did all the things you would expect of a Marxist party. May-Day was a
                    big deal. The party leadership would establish slogans for each May-Day
                    celebration. And the faithful would chant them like “Forward ever, Backward
                    never”. They would sing the “Internationale” But they were always very friendly
                    toward me. Nobody was hostile to me. There was no tension. One of Jagan's key
                    deputies, a 1970s Howard University trained medical doctor with whom I had a
                    very good relationship, would always address me, have jokingly as “comrade
                    ambassador”. With the exception of the Foreign Minister, I had access to anyone
                    I wanted in the government. They were perfectly willing to see me. They invited
                    me to everything. And the U.S. had significant assistance programs there and of
                    course an active Peace Corps program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about a time when the Soviet Union ceased
                        to be the Soviet Union, I think by '92. And reverberations all over Eastern
                        Europe. The whole system, essentially Marxist Leninist just died on the
                        American and European campuses, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well I don't think the average Indo-Guyanese guy in Guyana who voted
                    loyally for the PPC cared about Marxism at all. But the party leadership did.
                    The old line people. Especially those over 50 and were raised in this dogma. And
                    remember they worked harder than anyone else in the party. They were moving all
                    around the country all the time tending to their grass-root party organizations.
                    They were constantly organizing and fertilizing the faith of the Party cadre.
                    This was a party organized like the communist party. It was a communist party!
                    But it was operating when communism's time had clearly passed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the Foreign Minister several times in not
                        the most friendly terms. Who was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: His name was Clement Rohee. He had been Foreign Minister for quite a while
                    when I arrived. He always seemed to have plenty of time to sign trade and
                    cultural agreements with Cuba, but did not have much time for the Ambassador of
                    the United States which was providing fifteen million dollars a year in
                    assistance. Remember this was a country with 800,000 people. We had also a large
                    Peace Corp contingent. And of course the US was the largest market for Guyana's
                    exports. In our meetings he was civil, but he would put me off for 6 weeks at a
                    time before he would agree to see me. It was very, very frustrating. On two
                    occasions I actually wrote letters to the President Jagan essentially saying
                    look, I have some serious business to conduct with your government and I can't
                    seem to get any time with the Foreign Minister. She immediately called me in and
                    we talked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point what were the American interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: They were not huge. There were a number of American businesses there. Gold
                    mining companies, although the largest was Canadian, a US owned bauxite mining
                    operation, fish processing companies, a large box company. The tropical timber
                    industry was large but not in American hands. We were concerned about the high
                    level of illegal immigration to the US from and through Guyana. Drug trafficking
                    was an issue. Tough we never had a permanent DEA Agent we did have a multiple
                    ton cocaine bust of a ship passing through Georgetown. And we were concerned
                    with Guyana simply because it was a very poor in the Western Hemisphere that we
                    wanted to see develop. But I cannot say that United States had absolutely
                    critical foreign policy interests either because Guyana's geographic or
                    proximity issue or because they produced a strategic mineral unavailable
                    elsewhere. That would be a vast overstatement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now at one point way back we were concerned about Guyana
                        was part of a n expanding crescent in Caribbean that include Cuba and
                        Granada..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Actually there is some truth to that. During the “Cold War” Guyana was
                    quite an interesting place. The Soviets had a huge Embassy, the Chinese had a
                    large presence as well as Yugoslavs and the Romanians. Even by the time I got
                    there the North Koreans still maintained an Embassy, the Chinese were building a
                    brand new embassy, and, of course, the Cubans were there, in fairly large
                    numbers — medical people and sports trainers. As you know Cuba was renting out
                    their medical people and athletic coaches all over Latin America and the
                    Caribbean.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>There is an interesting story I would like to tell you. The Soviet Embassy, I
                    guess in the mid-80s, was built on a choice piece of land on the coast donated
                    by the government. U.S. had wanted to build a new embassy as well but did not
                    want to accept the property where the government wanted to put us because it had
                    been confiscated from its owners by the Burnham government without compensation.
                    Therefore, we decided to build our modern bomb proof on the same plot of land on
                    which the Ambassador's old wooden residence had been located, but with an
                    exemption from the new State Department setback standards since there was simply
                    not enough room. .</p>
                <p>The Soviets Embassy was a large compound that contained not only the chancery,
                    but also, in the typical soviet manner, the apartments and recreation facilities
                    for the twenty five or so Soviet families. By the time I arrived the Soviet
                    Union no longer existed and the Soviet Embassy was now the Russian Embassy.
                    However, Russia at that point had fallen on very hard economic times and could
                    not keep the entire compound going.To compensate they built a lousy chain link
                    fence right down the middle of the compound and turned the apartments into a
                    hotel and athletic facilitiepool, tennis court, weight room into a private club
                    open to all who wanted to pay the monthly fee the “Ambassador” club. They also
                    rented our their recreation hall, which was converted into a night club, called
                    “Night Flight”. Since there were few sports facilities around, I joined the
                    “Ambassador Club” for a time.</p>
                <p>I should note that the Russian Ambassador was very friendly as was the Chinese
                    Ambassador. There were only 12 ambassadors in Guyana. Of course I was restricted
                    on my contacts with the Cuban ambassador, but the remember there were only 12
                    foreign embassies in Guyana. It was a small place, and the Cuban was the Dean of
                    the diplomatic corps based on his length of service Georgetown . And also since
                    I was one of the few Spanish speakers around, I got invited to social events for
                    the Spanish speaking community at which the Cuban ambassador was almost always
                    present.. When I was with the Cuban in such situations, we spoke mostly of
                    baseball and he told dirty jokes. In fact, there was a custom that each month
                    one of the 12 foreign Ambassadors would host a lunch for the other 11
                    ambassadors. And in that situation I had to invite the Cuban as the Dean of the
                    diplomatic corps. I was unable to communicate at all with the North Korean since
                    he spoke no language I knew, and certainly not English. At that time, the 3-4
                    North Korean diplomats in Georgetown survived by selling contraband, liquor, you
                    name it, they had brought in under their diplomatic privileges. I communicated
                    with the Russian, Venezuelan, Colombian, and Cuban ambassadors in Spanish. None
                    of them spoke decent English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Guyana have any border problems at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>MACK: Guyana had has a long standing border problem with Venezuela. Actually was
                    more than a border problem, an existential problem since Venezuela claimed at
                    least two thirds of Guyana's national territory. The problem dated back to the
                    nineteenth century when Guyana was a still British colony. The dispute had been
                    settled by international arbitration in the early 1900s, which, while Guyana was
                    still British Guyana, largely in Guyana's favor. A prominent American whose name
                    I cannot recall was one of the arbiters. Venezuela accepted the ruling for
                    forty, fifty or sixty years. However, I think in the early 1960s, one of the
                    assistants of the arbitration panel now on his death bed alleged that
                    arbitration decision had been cooked. The Venezuelan Government immediately
                    seized on this alleged confession to declare the arbitration decision null and
                    void and reinstated its claim.</p>
                <p>I personally think that British historical British claim is probably correct
                    given that the Dutch and then the British had established plantations along the
                    coast of the disputed area over 300 years before Guyana's independence. But
                    while I was in Guyana, the Chavez government did not push the issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any residue of Jonestown?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: No! There was no residue of Jonestown, site of the mass suicide of over 800
                    American followers of the California sect led by the Rev. Jim Jones. By the way,
                    I visited the place 20 year after the end and found virtually nothing. You would
                    not know that almost a 1000 people lived there. The jungle had reclaimed it.,
                    except for couple of rusty old tractors and other farm implements. By he way
                    Jonestown is located in an extremely isolated area in Western Guyana not far
                    from Venezuela. No roads link the area to the outside world. Everything had to
                    move by air or boat . It was very inaccessible. That is why Rev Jones was able
                    to do get away with the things he did in Jonestown away from the scrutiny of the
                    world. Unless you were invited at the time, you could have not gotten into the
                    settlement even if you were physically able to get to the front gate which
                    itself would have been difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Peace Corps doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>MACK: Oh! The Peace Corps was very active. They were working in health, they
                    taught school, they worked in community development. Having been a former Peace
                    Corps volunteer myself, I was very close to the director and the volunteers. I
                    visited the volunteers frequently. However, Guyana was a challenging place for
                    volunteers because of threats to their personal security. Shortly before I had
                    arrived there had been a spate of assaults on volunteers including rapes to the
                    point that the Peace Corps came close to leaving the country. The attacks were
                    criminal in nature, not politically motivated. There was a high level of violent
                    crime in Guyana in general. Most volunteers physically stood out and were seen
                    as easy targets by the criminal element. In the end the Peace Corps decided to
                    stay but did remove the volunteers from urban areas. They had originally thought
                    the volunteers would be safe there since they had placed them with families
                    thinking that their living with local families would give them protection. That
                    turned out not be the case given the high level of criminality in the
                    community.</p>
                <p>Security in the rural areas turned out to be much better. However, even there
                    life was not easy for volunteers. The climate is very hot and humid. Even though
                    trade winds blow through the Guyana coast, for those without electricity life
                    was hard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was USAID doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: AID was helping to strengthen private sector organizations. They worked in
                    health and they financed the reconstruction of sea walls or dikes. Remember much
                    of Guyana's coast is three or four feet below sea level at high tide. First the
                    Dutch and then the British built sea walls all along the coast for 150 miles to
                    reclaim tidal swamps for agriculture. Sea walls need to be maintained. And they
                    were not well maintained under the Burnham government after independence. A lot
                    of sections had crumbled an collapsed. A lot of rock had be brought in from the
                    interior to rebuild the walls. By the way there is no surface rock on the coast.
                    It is all mud. Rock had be brought from inland. It was quite expensive.</p>
                <p>We did some training of judges and prosecutors and helped them rewrite some legal
                    codes and things like that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Before we go there, I should tell you about one scandal that hit us in
                    Guyana. While I was there an untenured Junior Officer named Tom Carroll arrived
                    at post as a rotational office. He had come from the US Interest Section in
                    Taiwan. What I did not know, since the Department did not tell me, was that
                    Carroll had left Taiwan early under a cloud. And he went to work first in the
                    consulate session as our one non immigrant Visa Officer. Remember, we were a
                    very small post. Sometime after his arrival, I would imagine three to six months
                    after his arrival, he fell in with a crowd of visa fixers. And he went into
                    business with them. And over a period of about a year, he sold about a thousand
                    visas, for I would say between five or ten thousand dollars a piece. It turned
                    out that he had made arrangements to be paid at home by the fixer.</p>
                <p>Carroll arrived I think in 1998 I believe and was assigned to the Consulate
                    Session as the Visa Officer working with non-immigrants. His refusal rate was,
                    in fact, twice as high as his predecessor. And he created an image of somebody
                    who was very committed to his job and who took his responsibility of
                    adjudicating non-immigrant visa applicants very seriously. By the way, among the
                    first time applicants, our refusal rate was historically about 90%. Even
                    counting all applicants our refusal rate normally was about seventy percent, to
                    give you an idea. I will not talk about his supervisor, the head of the consular
                    section, but obviously Carroll was not well supervised. Overtime, unbeknownst to
                    me and unbeknownst to his supervisor, Carroll began to sell visas in cahoots
                    with a known Guyanese visa fixer. He covered his tracks well since his refusal
                    rate remained well above that of his predecessor.</p>
                <p>About a year before I left, and about ten months after Carroll arrived, I began
                    to get reports from various sources alleging he was selling visas. By the way
                    these such allegations are constant at high refusal posts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh Yes! I was a consular all of my career, but you have to
                        take such allegations seriously.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>MACK: You have to take them seriously. When I first heard about his alleged
                    involvement, I was somewhat skeptical I have to confess because Carroll had been
                    very, very assiduous in tracking down visa scams and that sort of thing,
                    particularly involving Chinese migrants. He spoke fluent Mandarin by the way.
                    The Chinese came through Hong Kong, some of them with visas they had purchased
                    from the Surinamese Embassy in Beijing. They transited the Netherlands where the
                    authorities simply let them continue on to Suriname. Eventually they made there
                    way to Guyana by boat and on to Venezuela and up through the Caribbean to the
                    US. .</p>
                <p>In any event, an investigation into Carroll was launched first by our post
                    security officer, later assisted by others sent from Washington. By September of
                    1999, a serious investigation was underway and it was pretty clear to me that
                    Carroll had in fact sold visas. Only a few of us in the embassy that knew an
                    investigation was under way. Keep in mind ours was a small embassy. The American
                    staff of only fifteen, almost all of whom frequently socialized together, from
                    the lowest to the highest ranking. I regularly played basketball with this
                    Carroll. He his wife were frequently at my house. It was that kind of post, like
                    a family. Yet, at the same time I knew an investigation was going on. Of course,
                    I couldn't let on even to my wife. To make a long story short short Carroll was
                    led to believe that another consular officer was willing to sell visas. Since
                    Carroll wanted to keep his business going after he left post, he propositioned
                    the other officer to go into business with him for part of the proceeds.</p>
                <p>Keep in mind I knew all this was going on. You can imagine living like this at a
                    small post. When Carroll was about to leave post for home leave and his next
                    assignment, I threw a big farewell party for him. The short of it is that when
                    Carroll returned to Chicago for home leave, he was arrested by federal agents.
                    He was given an opportunity to cooperate with the prosecutors for a reduced
                    sentence but despite the incontrovertible evidence against him, including tapes
                    of his propositions to the other officer, he refused and was sentenced to
                    twenty-one years in jail. Two of his Guyanese confederates were caught in the US
                    and are serving time. I think this was the first successful prosecution of US
                    consular officer for visa fixing for many years. I think Carroll is getting out
                    this year after serving six years. The FBI recovered over a million dollars in
                    cash and gold bullion from several safe deposit boxes. My guess is that he has
                    several million more stashed somewhere that was not recovered. Possibly in
                    Taiwan since his wife was Taiwanese and I believe we have no extradition treaty
                    in Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>MACK: He was an American from Chicago. At least one of his parents was Irish
                    since it turned out he had an Irish passport as well as a diplomatic passport.
                    By the way we don't have an extradition treaty with either Ireland or Taiwan so
                    he was never granted bail. I have to admit I liked Carroll. While he did have a
                    very short fuse, he was smart and energetic and would have made an excellent
                    commercial officer if he could have controlled his temper. In the beginning it
                    never occurred to me that he was selling visas. It was a tragic situation and
                    absolutely devastated my American staff when I brought them in Sunday to
                    announce his arrest. People were absolutely devastated. They could not believe
                    it. These were people who had socialized with him, eaten lunch with him, worked
                    on the visa line with him. They just couldn't believe it. They felt utterly,
                    utterly betrayed. I stayed on an extra month in order just to see this thing
                    through. To make sure he departed post as planned and after his arrest to help
                    the staff heal because they were so devastated by this.</p>
                <p>It was not only a said situation, it did not have to happen. If the US Foreign
                    Service personnel system had been willing to tell me that this guy had a
                    checkered past I would have looked at him in a different way; but I presume they
                    wanted to give him an opportunity to start with a clean slate to be able to get
                    tenure. And the Foreign Service paid the price.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find out what his problem in Taiwan was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I never was officially told. I think it may have been some sort of sexual
                    harassment, problem possibly related to visas. I am not sure. But let me tell
                    you another story about this guy that he himself had told me before I knew he
                    was involved in selling visas. His first Foreign Service assignment had been to
                    Beijing. As a junior rotational office there, he had spent some time working
                    with the visa section chief, a former marine, who was later indicted for visa
                    frauthat means selling visas, but who beat the rap. Carroll actually told me
                    this. It never occurred to me then that Carroll had learned from this officer
                    and came to Georgetown with criminal intent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That very seldom ever happens.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>MACK: I am not so sure. Apparently the Foreign Service has passed these people
                    along quite a bit. Carroll is not the first Junior Officer or non-Junior officer
                    I have served with who has been investigated for visa fraud. He is only the
                    first one I have worked with who was convicted and served time. But I know for a
                    fact that others with whom I have served were associated with visa fraud, and in
                    one case proven to be involved in a visa selling scheme. That particular guy was
                    not prosecuted and allowed to retire since the investigators could not prove he
                    personally took any money. The Foreign Service has a problem here. After Carroll
                    was arrested, I sent my A-100 classmate Mary Ryan, then serving Assistant
                    Secretary of the Bureau of Consular Affairs a cable on this with some
                    recommendations for changes in training at FSI. Once I returned from Georgetown,
                    I personally told her then deputy, Maura Harty, of my concerns. Both are very
                    capable officers, but did not feel I got a very sympathetic response. Both were
                    very protective to their consular officers. So what can I say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 2000 you left. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I returned to Washington. The US Congress was about ready to pass the Plan
                    Colombia Support Act. Under Secretary for Political Affairs Ambassador Tom
                    Pickering, for whom I worked many years prior in El Salvador, asked me to come
                    back and head up a new Inter-Agency Task Force called the Plan Colombia Task
                    Force. The idea was that the Task Force would facilitate the coordination the
                    implementation of US support to Plan Colombia. We are talking about a billion
                    dollar package here. I started up the inter-agency task force before Congress
                    even passed the appropriation, but we knew it was coming and wanted to be ready.
                    We basically teed up for the Principles, that is those senior officials in the
                    various US departments with programs to be implemented with Plan Colombia Funds,
                    issues that could not be resolved a lower level.</p>
                <p>That is what I did for about eight months . Once our support for Plan Colombia
                    was launched I moved to Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement
                    Affairs (INL) where I served first as Deputy Assistant Secretary with
                    responsibility for Latin America and the INL Air Wing, which provided support
                    for our counternarcotics programs, at that time largely in the Andes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was most of the vast amount of Plan Colombia money
                        going to be spent?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>MACK: Well a significant part of what came to INL was actually then funneled to
                    other implementing agencies, much of it USAID for alternative development or to
                    the Department of Justice for legal and judicial reform. Alternative Development
                    programs were aimed at providing alternative livelihoods for people who had been
                    growing coca. INL itself executed very large programs to support aerial coca
                    eradication In Colombia and to train specialized police units to go in and bust
                    big drug labs often defended by and later also run by guerrillas. In fact the
                    guerrillas, especially the FARC, actually pushed aside many of the traditional
                    narcotic traffickers and took over much of the businesses themselves. And of
                    course many anti-guerrilla para militaries groups got heavily involved in the
                    drug trade as well. So there were the three major areas: narcotics control,
                    alternative development and legal and judicial reform.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then you moved. You were then working with the new
                        administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Correct. Bush came in January of 2001. It was at that time that I moved
                    from the Plan Colombia Task Force to INL. In 2000, we had negotiated with the
                    Government of Colombia, the conditions under which we would provide the Plan
                    Colombia assistance. The biggest issue was getting the Colombian Government, the
                    Pastrana government, to agree to specific targets for eradication. And after an
                    enormous amount of back and forth during two weeks at the Colombian foreign
                    ministry in Bogota, the Colombians agreed to reduce their coca cultivation by
                    50% by 2006. That is what has happened if you use the UN coca figures. According
                    to the CIAD figures, there is as much coca as there ever was, but the CIA keeps
                    discovering new coca areas that have been there all along, which distorts the
                    figures. In any event, these results made were possible because of aerial
                    eradication. I should note that while then President Pastrana would occasionally
                    place temporary restrictions on spraying for political reasons, or as a sign of
                    good faith in his on and off again and eventually fruitless negotiations with
                    the FARC, the current Colombian President, Alvaro Uribe has been unwavering for
                    his support for coca eradication.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was quite an apparatus by this time in the
                        Department of State for drug trafficking wasn't there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Indeed. The Bureau of International Narcotics of Law Enforcement Affairs
                    maintained large apparatus. That apparatus included an Air Wing which we
                    sometimes joked was the seventh largest air force in the Western Hemisphere. I
                    don't know if that was true, but we had over 100 aircraft including helicopters
                    fixed wing. The helicopters, armed by the way, rode shot gun for the Air Wing
                    and Colombian spray planes. In addition we had supply aircraft. And of course we
                    had to have the contract people who flew them and maintained them. With Plan
                    Colombia money we also bought 300 million dollars worth of helicopters for the
                    Colombian police and military. So all this required an impressive effort to make
                    it work.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this all concentrated in Colombia? What were we doing
                        in Bolivia and Peru?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: When I was in INL, we only sprayed in Colombia, both of coca and opium
                    poppy. In the 1990s we had sprayed poppy in Guatemala. Peru and Bolivia did not
                    allow aerial spraying of coca. They depended on manual eradication. But we did
                    support the Peruvian Police Air Wing and the Air Force in Bolivia which were
                    involved in counter-drug operations. We also supported Peru's aerial intercept
                    program with aircraft. And of course INL financed local government manual
                    eradication operations in both Peru and Bolivia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you have that job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: I had that job until the summer of 2002 when I retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During that time did you find any change in focus on the
                        drug issue between the Clinton and Bush Administrations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Actually not. Our Assistant Randy Beers, who started drug the Clinton
                    administration remained in his job until the summer of 2002 when went to the
                    National Security Council. By the way, Randy resigned his NSCA job not much
                    later and went to work for the Kerry campaign as a senior foreign policy
                    advisor. I am sure you have had an interesting conversation with Randy about the
                    things we are discussing now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We haven't come up to that point yet!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: The bottom line is that there was very strong program continuity between
                    the Clinton Administration and the Bush Administration with respect to narcotics
                    control in Latin America. I would like to believe that Kerry would have followed
                    the same path.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes Colombia has been portrayed as turning into a
                        narco state</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well that is an unfair characterization and obviously I have seen a lot
                    more sides of Colombia than the average person. Yes, the narcotic traffickers
                    and the cartels gained enormous influence in Colombia, and even apparently made
                    a substantial campaign contribution to a former president, Samper. They probably
                    controlled a quarter of the Colombian Congress at one point. They had
                    infiltrated people into much of the government.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>However, many brave Colombians didn't fall prey to this and sacrificed their
                    lives. They were in Executive branch, the army, police, the judiciary, and they
                    were also in Congress. We were able to make common cause with these people.</p>
                <p>Those people are in power in Colombia today. They were in power when I was
                    working there as well. Colombia's mistake was letting things go too far before
                    they decided to address the problem frontally. For many years they thought it
                    was America's problem but it turned out to be much more a threat to their
                    country if everything is considered. Now a large number of Colombians are
                    fighting quite hard and sacrificing an awful lot to get their country back and I
                    think they are having some success. But it is not easy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you retired in 2002 and since then what have you
                        been doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: Well, a month after I retired from the Foreign Service I started working
                    with The Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission, best known by its
                    initials in Spanish, CICAD. CICAD is the drug control agency of the Organization
                    of American States. And since September 2004 I have been the Executive
                    Secretary. In other words, I head up the permanent staff of this organization,
                    which is based at the OAS headquarters in Washington. We carry out programs to
                    train people and strengthen institutions involved in drug control, drug
                    prevention and drug treatment in Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the fight continues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: The fight continues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there a diminution of support from the United States
                        and does it have any real effect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: There was a reduction financial support from the US for my organization in
                    the last year. But that is probably a product of Katrina and Iraq. So everybody
                    is feeling the pain and I am feeling the pain as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Jim I want to thank you very much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MACK: My pleasure.</p>
