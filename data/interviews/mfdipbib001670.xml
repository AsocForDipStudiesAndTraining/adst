                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is January 11, 2001. This is an interview with David
                        Michael Wilson. The interview is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training, and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. Do you go
                        by David or Dave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: David, Dave, or Michael. It depends on what I am doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let's start at the beginning. Tell me when and where
                        you were born and a little about your family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I was born in May of 1939, May 3 to be precise, in the Berkshire hills of
                    western Massachusetts, a place called Pittsfield, Massachusetts. I grew up there
                    for 18 years, attended public schools. My father ran a toy store and a wayside
                    garden and furniture store.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a little about the background of your father and
                        your mother.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: My father was born in the United States. Both of his parents were born in
                    western Russia. It could be considered Poland, the Ukraine, etc. My mother also
                    was born in the United States as were her two parents, but her grandparents came
                    from Germany. I attended public school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your parents go to college or university or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Both did; neither graduated. My mother went to Smith College; my father
                    went to MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Neither ended up graduating
                    for a variety of reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is very interesting; these are two very top rated
                        schools. Well, in Pittsfield, what was Pittsfield like in the 40's?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It was considered by sociologists as one of the smaller standard
                    metropolitan areas in the country. It was always used to do research and studies
                    because of its proximity to Boston and New York and because of its size. It was
                    about 55-60,000 people. The major industry was General Electric (GE), which
                    built a very large plant during WWII to build transformers, which was then
                    turned into some work for the Navy on the Polaris missile. At one point GE had a
                    workforce of somewhere between eight to ten thousand which was major. By
                    comparison, the GE workforce now in Pittsfield, I understand, is between four
                    and five hundred. A major drop-off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in family business as a kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Only at Christmas time when the big selling period came. Not even in the
                    summers, in the summers I worked construction. I wanted to get away from the
                    family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About the family, did you have brothers or sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: My sister is eight years younger than I am. She lives in the Boston
                    area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So just to get a feel for the family, did you know some
                        families sit around the dining room table and talk about events of the world
                        or the day or the country or city or something? Was this an engaged family
                        this way or were you doing your own thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No. I was doing my own thing. My mother was interested in the liberal
                    side of politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have been Truman...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: When I look back, I criticized my mother as a kid. She took me into the
                    voting booth with her in 1948 and she didn't vote for Dewey. She didn't vote for
                    Truman. She voted for Henry Wallace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WILSON: I was in the voting booth, and I saw her pull the lever. But she was a
                    committed Democrat and my father was a member of the Republican city
                    committee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From '46 to '50 I was in Williams College which is up the
                        road a piece and Chuck Alberty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: He was a judge. Do you by chance know Jack Rogers?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The name is very familiar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Jack up until about two years ago was the traveling secretary for the
                    Boston Red Sox. Williams College is a good place. My younger son went there,
                    much against my wishes. I could see nothing more stultifying than living in a
                    small town in the Berkshires. I lived there for 18 years. My older son who
                    traveled around the world with us in the foreign service found nothing more
                    appealing than having a small town where he could call home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in both grade school and high school, what
                        sort of things engaged you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I was always interested in government affairs and international affairs.
                    I read the papers a lot. That intrigued me. Social studies if you will,
                    English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a good library there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes real good. It was one big library, absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about books, can you think of any books you sort of
                        enjoyed for fun or for learning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: One that made an impression on me that starts to come to mind now is
                    something called An Affair of State which was about love and sex in the Foreign
                    Service. I guess that got me interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well great. How about say in high school, was there sort
                        of a social mix there as far as working people, professional people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>WILSON: Oh yes, very much so. The town was very much a working class town. There
                    was a big mix. In fact we had a college preparatory course in high school, you
                    had a general studies course in high school, you had a technical or a shop
                    course in high school. One of the things that I can recall vividly is a friend
                    of mine was running for class president. I was sort of managing his campaign,
                    and I was very friendly with all the shop guys. At one point they grabbed me in
                    the auditorium and put me on their shoulders, I was back several rows of seats
                    in the auditorium. We won the election too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's great. Well,</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We had, it was a very interesting town because the school board was
                    controlled basically by Irish Catholics. There was a big controversy over the
                    Lord's Prayer which we said every morning. Do we end up with “For Thine is the
                    kingdom and the power and the glory forever,” or do we eliminate that? Depending
                    who your teacher was, you said it or eliminated it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Catholics didn't use it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I grew up in the Protestant tradition and was
                        always...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The Protestants were the majority in fact. My boy scout troop was in a
                    Protestant church.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about was there a division, there probably was a
                        rather solid Catholic educational establishment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes there was a parochial school. It was a very good school. Several of
                    my good friends went there. They were doing very well until they ended up with a
                    sex scandal in the high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of those spices of life I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>WILSON: Another little interesting sidelight was right after the war we had a man
                    in town who went to law school at night, an Italian Catholic, Silvio Conti.
                    Silvio in the late 40's early 50's decided he wanted to run for Congress. He
                    went to the party that all the instincts drove him to, namely the Democratic
                    party. The Democratic Party said, “You are a Wop; we don't want you.” You are
                    Italian, we are Irish Catholics. So he went to the Republicans, and in the first
                    election he won, not by a lot, but he won. He got all the Italians to vote for
                    him. After that no one could touch him. The problem was Silvio was a Republican,
                    but he voted as if he were a Democrat. He voted with the Republicans to organize
                    the house, but the Democrats really stood up because they could have had him. He
                    was a major figure, but they didn't want him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is interesting in Massachusetts, well it is true in a
                        lot of places particularly then, ethnic politics are really strong.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: When I came back from my first overseas posting, that was in Ivory Coast,
                    I was somewhat disenchanted with the Foreign Service, and I went and talked to
                    Silvio, whom I had known vaguely through my father. He said, “Hey do you want a
                    job with a friend of mine, a colleague across the hall, a guy from Maine named
                    Stan Tupper?” I went over and talked to Stan Tupper and they offered me a job
                    for about $2,000 more than I was making with the State Department with USIA. I
                    really weighed this heavily for a couple of days and decided I didn't want to be
                    tied down to an individual and be beholden to, almost an intellectual slave to
                    an individual. I turned down Stan Tupper's job. He was then appointed by I guess
                    it was President Johnson, to be the commissioner general for the Expo in
                    Montreal. He left the Congress. I probably would have gone with him there and
                    life would have been different. Who knows?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, who knows? Well while you were in high school, you
                        were of course in Massachusetts, your parents had been exposed to two of the
                        top educational institutions in the country you know. One of the big
                        businesses in Massachusetts is education. Where did you think about
                        going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I really didn't want to go to a place like Williams because I wanted to
                    get out of the area. I thought of the Boston area. I thought of New York area. I
                    thought of the far west. But I was intrigued by New York City. I liked New York
                    City. I applied to Columbia College in the city of New York. I got in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Columbia from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: As an undergraduate I was at Columbia from '57 to '61, Columbia
                    College.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What wee you taking then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Liberal arts. I got a bachelor of arts. I had enough to major in either
                    government, which today would be called political science and or drama, theater;
                    my major was political science. I specialized in international affairs. I liked
                    those.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Columbia has always been sort of, it is in New York City,
                        sort of a hotbed of whatever people would be hotbeds in, of student
                        protests. This wasn't that era though.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No, it was several years before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, of various things. It was always a politically active
                        area. Did you get involved in any of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No, at that point it was not terribly active. My advisor who was assigned
                    to me at the beginning of my time at Columbia, during the late 60's and early
                    70's was very much involved in some of the SDS people. In fact he was
                    interviewed by the FBI several times because he was involved or they thought his
                    students were involved in the blowing up of a townhouse down in Greenwich
                    Village.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were making bombs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes they were. But no, I was not involved. I never protested
                    anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well there really weren't many protests then. It was the
                        end of the Eisenhower period and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well the one thing that did happen is it concerns people like leopards
                    don't change their spots. In my class in junior year, the year of elections. We
                    had the elections, and a man named Frank Lorenzo was running for treasurer, and
                    he won. It was discovered a couple of weeks afterwards he had stuffed the ballot
                    boxes or caused his friends to stuff the ballot boxes so the whole election was
                    thrown out and we had no representative government in my junior year. It came
                    back in my senior year. In case you may know, you won't remember specifically
                    but this Lorenzo then ultimately became head of Continental Airlines, was
                    accused by the unions of a lot of chicanery. He didn't change. He did the same
                    things in business. In fact when we had our 25th reunion he was running
                    Continental, and there was an offer, he would fly any class member from anywhere
                    in the world to New York for the reunion free. Unfortunately I was sitting in
                    Washington, so it didn't help me, but it would have if I had been somewhere far
                    away.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did any of your professors particularly impress or
                        influence you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, the professor I had for one international relations course, a
                    seminar which we analyzed over the course of the year, the role of assassination
                    in international relations. It was a good course. We had about six or seven
                    people in there, and we each studied part of the world. It later turned out this
                    guy was a CIA recruiter, but it didn't matter at the time. That made an
                    impression on me. Another professor of history specialized in the U.S.
                    presidency. He is still doing it today. In fact he was on the commission to look
                    at the Kennedy assassination. He made an impression on me as did my advisor who
                    was a professor who specialized in the Civil War. Oh, and in the area of
                    English, I had a drama professor named Eric Bentley who was a major figure in
                    contemporary drama analysis and writing. He specialized in German drama,
                    Berthold Brecht and all that because in New York if you were talking about a
                    playwright or music, you could go down and see it. That is one of the beauties
                    of being in New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the United Nations? Did that have much effect
                        on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No. It didn't enter into any of my studies. One of the people who was at
                    the school at the time was Arthur MacArthur the son of Douglas MacArthur.
                    Douglas came to speak, and that was kind of interesting, having been blown out
                    by Truman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whatever happened; I understand he changed his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It was very strange. I felt badly for him because his father was living
                    in the Waldorf, and he had to commute daily. They wouldn't let him live on
                    campus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like a sad life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The other thing that was interesting in my freshman year actually, was
                    the time when “The $64,000 Question,” and one of our teachers, one of our
                    professors, his name was Charles van Doren got himself very much involved. His
                    father, of course, was a major figure in the English department at Columbia.
                    There was a lot going on. In fact we had demonstrations supporting him. One of
                    the networks gave me $25 to use my own camera.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the major scandals of the time. The quiz was
                        crooked.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>WILSON: That was the point. The quiz was crooked, and it sort of downgraded the
                    academic mystique because here he was this professor of English, and yet he
                    wasn't really that smart. I mean he was smart, smarter than some.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the Nixon-Kennedy election of 1960.
                        This engaged an awful lot of students. Did this engage you at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. it did. I mentioned Congressman Silvio Conti. In the election of
                    1958 both the presidential election and the senate election before, Senator
                    Kennedy was up for re-election from Massachusetts for senator as was Congressman
                    Conti. Congressman Conti was opposed by a very interesting person, interesting
                    is not the word, by a very engaging person from Williams College...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: James MacGregor Burns. He was an instructor when I was
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I worked very hard for him. I really worked, volunteer work, I didn't get
                    paid. I went out and pushed buttons, gave out brochures. I was certain he was
                    going to win because he was clearly the better man. Compared to Conti, MacGregor
                    Burns was brilliant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He has written some excellent books on Roosevelt. He is
                        still around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: He is still around. I always was impressed. I liked him and I worked
                    hard. A friend of mine said I'll bet you a lemon meringue pie in the face if
                    Conti wins. I lost so I got the pie in the face. I remember that. And the thing
                    that really surprised me to this day I didn't analyze it. How could, not only
                    did Conti win, but he won big. How could Conti beat this brilliant professor, at
                    the same time that Kennedy was winning big across the state? It goes back to the
                    theme all politics is local. He again, Silvio had the Italian vote and he was
                    liked by the people Italian or not. At the same time, I guess just as an aside,
                    this was the back end of the McCarthy era. We had a reverend in the Unitarian
                    Church. He used to use his Sunday pulpit to rail against McCarthy. He brought
                    some people down from Williams College and although I wasn't terribly religious
                    I would go to Sunday service to hear the lectures. It wasn't a service so much
                    as it was political lectures. I have forgotten Schumann I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fred Schumann.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, he came down from Williams.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fred Schumann I remember because I was in class when one
                        of the first people McCarthy attacked was Fred Schumann who was a professor
                        of political science. They called him Red Fred. He was to the left.
                        Basically he was sort of a German socialist type.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: He'd come down and lecture on Sunday at the Unitarian Church in
                    Pittsfield. I used to go. That impressed the hell out of me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were all very proud. Williams held up fairly well
                        during that period when some of the other universities kind of
                        collapsed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, Williams did a pretty good job. As much as I knew about Williams.
                    Dwight Emberson, this guy who I helped get the presidency of our senior class,
                    ultimately went to Williams. He dropped out for the priesthood to become a
                    priest. Nonetheless, he went to Williams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Columbia pretty much for Kennedy during this '60
                        election?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Oh, yes, sure. In fact there is no question for me, very much pro, in
                    fact even now I got a call from somebody who is down here, graduated in '76,
                    asked me if I wanted to come to his house next Saturday for a protest inaugural
                    dinner with other Columbians. Sure Columbia was pretty much for Kennedy. But
                    amusingly, I must have been in the Foreign Service all of six or seven months
                    when I had run into someone form the Bulgarian embassy. The embassy had a
                    reception given, the Soviet embassy, for young diplomats. I saw this guy, and I
                    saw him a couple of times. Fortunately I had gone to the intelligence research
                    people and asked them some questions that I could ask them. I wasn't doing this
                    behind anybody's back. But when security people find this out, they were
                    furious. They gave me a grilling and we went over a lot of things. At one point
                    they said to me, “Do you know,” and they spouted off a Russian name? I don't
                    know the person. They said, “Are you sure? Think.” I said, “No.” They said,
                    “Well,” in a sarcastic manner, “It must have been some other David Michael
                    Wilson who on January X 1961, in a reception hall at Columbia University talked
                    to so and so from Radio Moscow.” I thought back, and I vaguely remember somebody
                    coming through with a microphone asking various students what do you think of
                    the exchange of New Year's greetings between Khrushchev and Kennedy? I don't
                    know what I said. Oh I said, “I think it is a good idea.” But I was dismayed
                    that the security apparatus would spend a lot of time going over that kind of
                    stuff. It was as though they would get something straight, but I really was
                    taken aback. How the hell did I know what I said back then and to whom I was
                    speaking. I had no idea. If I did say it, and they showed me the transcript, I
                    thought it was a good idea. I still think it is a good idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh God. Well, we are moving into '61. What were you
                        thinking about doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>WILSON: I was thinking about not going into the military. I didn't really know. I
                    took several exams. I took an exam for the National Security Agency, and I
                    passed it very well. I went in and actually talked to people, and I decided that
                    NSA was not for me because it didn't deal with people so much. It was abstract
                    things that did the treatment. I took the Foreign Service exam. That interested
                    me. Then I also took the law school boards, because I was thinking of going to
                    law school. That came up at the last minute. Ultimately that is what I did. I
                    went to NYU (New York University) law school as a last minute entrant. I began
                    there in the fall of 1961.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know much about the Foreign Service at all or was
                        this just a government job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well, no I knew a bit about the Foreign Service. As I say, I took a lot
                    of courses in international relations. The research in the library on my
                    assassination project in something called the Foreign Broadcast Information
                    Service (FBIS), which was at that time put out by the CIA, unclassified versions
                    or versions that were classified LOU (Limited Official Use) in the back room of
                    the big library in Columbia. I got access to them, special permission and all
                    that kind of stuff. I was intrigued by the Foreign Service, plus one of our
                    teachers was a professor, a teacher of French, because of his ties we had a
                    professor who came into government under Kennedy, ended up joining USIA and
                    going to Lebanon. I had a book that I had read for one of my courses called The
                    End of Ideology by a guy named David Bell who is at Columbia now or Harvard. I
                    red this guy's book, and we have kept in touch. He was in USIA (United States
                    Information Agency) in the Foreign Service. So it always intrigued me. Law
                    school was, you know you take these exams, you don't know when you are going to
                    be chosen, if you are going to be chosen. It is very much up in the air, so I
                    figured I would kill some time by going to law school, which did not thrill me
                    at all. I was not happy with it. Though in retrospect, I did the wrong thing. I
                    did three out of six semesters at NYU law school. In retrospect in the middle of
                    my third semester I got an offer from USIA to join the class in January of '63.
                    In retrospect, knowing what I know now, I could have easily asked them to
                    postpone my admission until I finished law school. It probably would have been a
                    good idea. I never would have wanted to practice law, but it would have been
                    very good to have it under my belt. Now, that is with hindsight. with hindsight
                    I realize the level at which they brought me in was the lowest level they
                    possibly could, and with a year and a half of graduate school, they could have
                    brought me in at a higher level. That is with hindsight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know, you know these things afterwards. Well what didn't
                        appeal to you about law?</hi>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>WILSON: It was almost too cute, half playing with words. I wasn't terribly keen
                    on it. One of the things that totally turned me off was property law. Going back
                    into the English system late 15th, 16th, 17th century, how the property law
                    developed. I could care less. I figured if I got to that point, I would hire a
                    good lawyer who spent all of his time delving into the rusty shelves of property
                    law and could do whatever he had to do. I was intrigued by some aspects of the
                    law. I liked some of the trial work. I liked constitutional law. I was very
                    pleased with that. In fact, one of the people we had on the faculty was a guy
                    named Herman Dawson who had worked for the Army in the Army-McCarthy hearings.
                    That part was fascinating. I enjoyed that aspect of it. I enjoyed especially the
                    constitution and how broad it was and how narrow it was in certain areas. To me
                    that was very intriguing. But the other parts of the law I didn't take to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you came into USIA when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: In January 1963. Again, I realized we had not taken finals and they said
                    no, you have to report by a certain day. I said, “Couldn't you wait until my
                    finals are over?” No. So I came down to Washington on a bus. I had my law books
                    with me. I passed the courses, but barely. I realized again they could have
                    brought me in three weeks later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know you talk to people and one of the things you
                        learn after awhile is how to deal with the bureaucracy. You are at the lower
                        end of the spectrum, and you think that somebody has got a list and is just
                        checking them off trying to fill it, and couldn't care less about
                        anything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. I didn't know how things worked. I learned that very
                    quickly. I learned, in fact one of the strikes that I have developed over the
                    course of the years is how you deal with bureaucrats, how you get things done.
                    One of the things, one of the critical elements in getting things done in a
                    bureaucracy is holding people responsible. It is not just this is the way the
                    foreign affairs manual reads. Who wrote it? It is written by people, by human
                    beings. To this day when I am dealing with different branches of government and
                    someone would say this is our policy, it turns me off. I don't accept this is
                    our policy. You know show me our policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The great myth of this whole thing of course was during
                        this whole period, there was the policy of if a woman Foreign Service
                        officer got married, she had to resign. People said, could I see where it is
                        written? No this is just our policy. There wasn't written policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. My first post was the Ivory Coast, and the economics
                    officer at the time was a man named Bob Oakley. His wife was Phyllis Oakley.
                    They had been in the A-100 course together and they got married. She resigned.
                    Ultimately she came back in and became ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am interviewing Phyllis right now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Phyllis is a fine woman. She truly is. I was always very impressed with
                    her. I was very impressed with her husband Bob, although he was not everyone's
                    cup of tea. He had a very dry, wry sense of humor. I used to say to Bob,
                    “Phyllis is at least as smart as you.” He didn't like that, but I meant it. If
                    not smarter than he, she was extraordinarily intelligent. But at one point when
                    I was between assignments, I was assigned to the board of examiners, we ran into
                    several problems about taking in minorities, etc. But one of the problems we ran
                    into was a woman who was very good, and she very clearly said that she had
                    several lovers and she was going to take one of them with her to her first
                    assignment. Security did not like this, but I argued that successfully, that if
                    it were a man and he was ticking off the number of women with whom he had slept,
                    they would think that was great. Because it is a woman, you just can't
                    discriminate like that. It was a question of standing up to security and I did,
                    and we won.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, when you came in in early January, '63, to your
                        A-100 course, was it a joint course with USIA and State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk a little about your impression of the people
                        you were with. We have already talked about Phyllis and Bob Oakley.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: They weren't in the course. They had their first course together. It
                    turned out I would have been the youngest in both classes except that somebody
                    in USIA was three months younger than I was, so I was okay. I guess I was 24
                    when I came in. Good course, good exposure. The first disappointment I had was
                    that after the eight weeks, whatever it was, the USIA split off to get into a I
                    don't know what it was, and my State Department colleagues took a consular
                    course. I argued in vain, I want to take the consular course because I will need
                    this quite overseas, particularly at that time we had a lot of separate USIA
                    little operations dotted around the country, and you are the only American
                    officer there, they needed to know consular work. I think subsequently in the
                    last decade or so they gave USIA people some consular training. But it is
                    critical. In my later years I was on an inspection team later, I found a
                    tremendous lack of consular knowledge even in the political and economic
                    sections. They say well that's consular work. Well it may be consular work but
                    it hinges very strongly on how America is perceived. The consular section is the
                    first section a foreign national has any contact with. It is critical. That's my
                    view anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I agree. I am basically a consular officer by
                        profession. It really is and I think that you have gotten into this almost
                        class structure that goes back a couple of centuries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well right now people who come here want to fit in. People who come to me
                    and say I want to join the Foreign Service, this is before the joining of USIA
                    back with State, I would recommend against joining USIA, recommend against the
                    political and economic corners. You know those are the glamour claims. But if
                    you really want to do something, get into either administrative work or consular
                    work. People would say yep, but that is where it is at. Take admin. You get a
                    good person in admin who knows what she or he is doing, and you can effect
                    foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Makes it work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up any feeling with the difference
                        between USIA and the people coming from USIA or State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. When I took my orals, I had the option at the last minute of
                    choosing USIA or State for one of those periods. I felt that USIA dealt more
                    with people. Over the medium to long term would have more of a lasting effect on
                    foreign policy. At the time that was a minority view. Subsequently in today's
                    world it has become fairly accepted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the USIA training go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Can we back up for a minute. In my oral exam I took up in New York
                    because I was there. It was a three person panel which was fine. They saw that I
                    had been studying the role of assassination in international politics. So
                    somebody asked me a question. Then to my utter delight, I gave an answer and
                    somebody on the panel said, don't you think, and somebody else on the panel said
                    no. The panel spent about 15 minutes arguing among themselves. I just sat back
                    an listened, which is good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel USIA treated you when you came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>WILSON: I think vis a vis my State colleagues it was much more personal type of
                    dealing. I can recall when we had a Bundy there who was number three in USIA,
                    related to McGeorge Bundy who was National Security Advisor. I can recall a
                    lecture that he gave talking about Dean Rusk saying you know, here come the
                    North Vietnamese communists. Ah, the critical element was the North Vietnamese
                    who aspire to godless communism. Godless was the proper term. They had to get
                    Godless in. He gave a Dean Rusk analogy saying well you know, if you drop a bomb
                    from the air or a bicycle, what is the difference. We did this kind of training.
                    I am not certain it was effective or State did more political reporting type of
                    training. But when I got out to my first post, the political officer was not
                    that energetic, at least until Bob Oakley took over as economic officer when I
                    got there. On Thursday and Friday afternoons the political officer would write
                    some sort of weekly memorandum and then go out. It didn't seem terribly
                    important to me, but I guess it was important to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well your first post was the Ivory Coast. Did you have any
                        particular feel, I mean did you ask for any of this, Africa or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No, I was just assigned to it. Actually my first assignment, and I found
                    this amusing at the time too, my first assignment was to Morocco. One day the
                    training officer, Art Hoffman came running in and said, “why didn't you tell
                    me?” I said, “What?” “Why didn't you tell me you were Jewish.” “I didn't think
                    that mattered.” He said, “You can't go to Morocco.” I said, “Why not?” He said,
                    “We are not assigning Jews to North Africa.” So they changed my assignment to
                    Abidjan and the guy who was going to Abidjan went to Morocco. It turned out it
                    was a good change except for the first PAO (Public Affairs Officer). I was
                    surprised.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I really am too. I mean sometimes we were brought up in
                        the Jewish faith and were you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering did Israel play much of a role, going back
                        and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No, I mean it gave me a set of moral values.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am thinking of the state of Israel.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>WILSON: No it didn't. At one point somebody asked me if I wanted to get the PAO
                    job in Tel Aviv. I was very torn, I did not take it. I was torn because I was
                    afraid if I were there, I might bend over so far backwards to be neutral that I
                    would become anti-Israeli. That concerned me very much. I didn't take the job.
                    But that was one of the major concerns I had. I felt like it would have affected
                    me but I don't know. In my work in the BEX Board of Examiners) coming in, we
                    were interviewing people from the New York area, who were obviously of Jewish
                    background, I would take delight in saying, you know, “The Arabs have got all
                    the oil. Why are we supporting the Israelis?” There was no correct answer, but
                    my purpose was to see how they reacted. What kind of emotions could they be
                    subjected to. That is the whole point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, absolutely. You are off to Abidjan. You were there
                        from '63 to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: '63 to the end of '65.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about the Ivory Coast at that time. Can
                        you tell me sort of what the government was like at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It was a one party state run by the PDCI, the Parti Democratique de Cote
                    D'Ivoire, and by Boigny. By today's standards, they have elections and we would
                    have been pleased with it. But we weren't, because this was sort of the
                    beginning of the Kennedy era. Well, I got there just after Kennedy was
                    assassinated. Bobby had been to the Ivory Coast. In fact one of the stories, and
                    I suspect it may be true, again I wasn't there, so it was third party. But they
                    said when Bobby came through he went to mass, because it is a Catholic country,
                    at least nominally. Most people are animist, but nominally Catholic. Bobby went
                    to church at the basilica, and they passed around a collection basket. As the
                    story goes, this guy who was one of the escort officers said, Bobby reached into
                    his pocket and got out a dollar bill. He turned to his wife and said, “Do you
                    have some smaller change?” She said, “Oh, Bobby, for God sakes, put the dollar
                    bill in.”</p>
                <p>I worked very closely with Bob actually because he had a good sense of humor and
                    in one sense the French were the enemies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Bob Oakley.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. We would take great delight in doing things that would annoy the
                    French a bit. We worked on exchange programs together. It was a good time to be
                    there. One of the few places that I felt that what I did really mattered because
                    it was a developing country. I could get places. I had contact with good
                    political leaders. I could have them over to the house. Bob would use me to get
                    some of the people in the media, some were very much influential on the
                    political side, and we worked together. I thought that was a very useful
                    function for someone in USIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job specifically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I started out as a junior officer in training in USIA. Then I did the
                    press information room.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our embassy like? Was it large?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: A good size. They had several ambassadors. The first ambassador they had
                    was James Wine who was a political appointee who was Kennedy's Protestant
                    religious advisor. He was fine. Then we got George Allen Morgan, head of the
                    Foreign Service Institute at one time. He came over and he was an intellectual.
                    At least he thought he was. I can recall on President Houphouet-Boigny's
                    birthday at one point, we had a staff meeting on what should the ambassador do
                    for the president's birthday present. Ultimately it came down to the ambassador
                    was going to give Houphouet-Boigny, the President of the Ivory Coast, a copy of
                    this ambassador's book on the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. I got a copy
                    nonetheless. That was fine. It was a good sized staff. There was a consular
                    section. It was small, but the problem at that point was as far as the U.S.
                    government was concerned, the future of Africa was not with the
                    Houphouet-Boignys in the Ivory Coast or Senghors in Senegal but Kwame Nkrumah in
                    Ghana and Sekou Toure. And we could not have been more wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, they basically destroyed their countries, these
                        guys.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I was thinking back. One of the things I really give Bob Oakley credit
                    for is that Bob was assigned to Vietnam, and because of his contacts, he could
                    have gotten out of it. He chose not to. He chose to go to Vietnam. I always
                    admired him for it. After he was there for about three or four months, he wrote
                    a letter back to the ambassador asking the ambassador to make certain that I,
                    David Michael Wilson, got a good ongoing assignment. Bob took the time out from
                    problems in Vietnam. Phyllis didn't go with him. But I really admired that about
                    him. I really appreciated it. What was I going to do for him? He went out of his
                    way to tell the ambassador he had a good officer.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you find yourself, you were saying we were more
                        or less putting our bets on the more radical elements. This was sort of the
                        spirit of the times. Africa had great promise, and these so-called
                        charismatic leaders seemed to be carrying the torch ahead of everyone
                        else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well that is true. They were, but we really didn't give much aid. We
                    figured at least, both Ivory Coast and Senegal were French protectorates. Every
                    minister had his French advisor by his hand. Our job was to get beyond the
                    French. They didn't deal with the Ivorians. I dealt with the university and set
                    up some programs with a Fulbright scholar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One theme in my interviews that has permeated when we have
                        talked about West Africa has been the feeling of the French that we were
                        trying to take over in the French speaking countries. Our people say this is
                        the farthest thought from our minds, I mean as far as influence goes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's true. We wanted to have more input, but we did not want to
                    shoulder the responsibility that the French were shouldering. Sure we have a lot
                    to put in, but we are not prepared to put in a 500 man garrison in to protect
                    the political situation as the French were and do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself particularly in the USIA thing
                        because you are talking about culture and all that which is probably the
                        most sensitive point of the French zone of influence? Did you find yourself
                        being suspect or the enemy by the French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well a little bit, by the French, not by the Ivorians. I didn't care
                    about the French. I had good French friends. One was teaching, a Frenchman who
                    had been in Vietnam and had been wounded, I had gotten to know him very well. I
                    was teaching his wife some English. He said, “You know Catherine who is
                    Vietnamese, she doesn't speak French that well and now you are trying to teach
                    her English. What the hell are you trying to do?” I remember one of our first
                    international visitor grantees; there weren't very many people to choose from. I
                    mean we were after him; the British were after him; the Germans were after him.
                    We got him and the French reps obviously. He is now a very wealthy lawyer living
                    in France. Spent time in the Ivory Coast half the time. I got to know, as I
                    said, several political figures who were in information or culture, high up in
                    the party. I had a little summer place, a place down by the beach. Abidjan isn't
                    right on the coast, you have to drive about 30 miles to get down to the coast.
                    But right next to my place was a place that was owned by the secretary general
                    of the national assembly who was a big party person. So I got to know him pretty
                    well. In a small country like that if you were active and you showed that you
                    care about people, they will open up to you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you married at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>WILSON: I was, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you meet your wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: In Northampton, Massachusetts. She was going to Smith College. I was
                    driving through one day and I felt the need of a woman. I called the dorm; I
                    knew somebody in the dorm. The somebody I called wasn't in, but this woman
                    answered. She became my wife. That is how it worked. We got married a week after
                    the Kennedy assassination. We got married on Thanksgiving day in '63. I had to
                    promise I would come back. Originally I had promised to come back in June of '64
                    to get married. Then when it came close to my leaving in early December, she
                    said, “No, we are not going to wait until you come back. You could come back
                    with one of those Peace Corps girls.” So we got married a week after the Kennedy
                    assassination. She finished up that semester at Smith and then she joined me.
                    Then she went back to finish up her degree. She had six months to go. It was
                    before I left the Ivory Coast. It worked fine. It was very interesting. This was
                    hard for me to believe, but when she was corresponding with Smith College to go
                    back and finish up, one of the offices she was corresponding with was the
                    housing office. She was using the Block Postale international mailing address.
                    They wrote back a couple of letters saying there was really no housing available
                    in Northampton, Massachusetts, but when she came they would give her several
                    places in Amherst which is not too far away. She knew where that was. Fine if
                    they have nothing available. She got to Northampton in the fall, and she went
                    into the housing office. They looked at her and said, “Oh, you are white.” This
                    is in western Massachusetts, a liberal school like Smith. Oh but you are white,
                    plenty of places here in Northampton. But they figured Amherst had a larger
                    black community than did Northampton. That is kind of amusing. But they were
                    very good to her and let her finish up. She could not live in the dorms because
                    she had been a married woman and exposed to sexual things other girls would
                    probably not been exposed to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh my God. What about how easy was it to make friends and
                        deal with the people of the Ivory Coast? I mean sort of government and
                        business people. Was it relatively easy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Because they were open. They were delighted to talk to people who weren't
                    French. you know my French wasn't so great. I didn't speak Baoul� or any of the
                    other local languages, but I spoke French to some, at least I thought I spoke
                    some kind of French. They were very open. That was very different; that was very
                    good. I said earlier at the first post I felt I accomplished more than any other
                    more sophisticated places I have been because there everything is in place, and
                    an individual really doesn't matter so much. In a small developing country, an
                    individual who can make contact with certain people can matter, can make a
                    difference.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what sort of things were we particularly interested
                        in exposing Ivorians to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well, we certainly wanted to expose them to the idea of a multi-party
                    state, since they only had one party really. That we did. We wanted to expose
                    them to some of our culture, our music in particular which was very helpful. We
                    wanted to expose them to the fact that we are alternatives to dealing with the
                    French and just being a lackey in the French order. Those were the things we
                    were interested in.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view Sekou Toure and Kwame Nkrumah and all at
                        that time? You were part of the African circuit so I am sure that people at
                        the embassy were looking at developments there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: They were getting a lot of AID (Agency for International Development)
                    money. Ivory Coast wasn't. Neither was Senegal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned in the Cote D'Ivoire about Soviet
                        influence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We were. We were also very concerned about Chinese influence. On the
                    other hand, one of the major forces influencing the Ivorians was the Israelis.
                    The Israelis set up a service corps for women run by the Israeli army. They were
                    helping with sanitation, things like this. Very important for the Ivory Coast.
                    In fact the lady who was heading it up, Colonel Worth, she and I arrived about
                    the same time, and I remember her well. We were staying at the hotel. I had the
                    most awful case of dysentery, and she told me what to do. She mothered me very
                    nicely. The Israelis were on our side. Quietly but they were on our side.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the Chinese doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Trying to gain some influence. They had no role in the Ivory Coast. The
                    Ivory Coast did not recognize them. The Ivory Coast recognized Taiwan. But they
                    had their own people come in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we keeping an eye on the army there or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No, not on the Ivory Coast army. The Ivory Coast did not have much of an
                    army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Houphouet-Boigny? What was our view of how he
                        was running things, and whither the Ivory Coast at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>WILSON: He was a benign dictator as far as we were concerned. He was trying to
                    bring his people along. The economy ran on cocoa, timber, this sort of thing. He
                    was doing very well to try to modernize the country, and at least nominally he
                    was democratically elected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any sort of opposition there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Very little. It started to develop but there was very little at the time.
                    But when there was, the only person I knew who had a cause to be killed was a
                    supreme court justice named Boca who was killed by accident. He was in jail.
                    Student movements were very important and I kept the pulse on those myself. One
                    of the things I did was to have contact with our embassies in London and Paris
                    because of many of the Ivorian students would go Paris or sometimes to London as
                    students, so you keep track of them there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of our most influential instruments anywhere is this
                        exchange program. How did it work in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It was just beginning. We didn't have very many Ivorians who wanted to
                    go. They didn't have enough English to go and study in the United States. We did
                    not have the programs we subsequently got to give English training to grantees
                    before they got into university training. So very few went to the United States.
                    A few but very few.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Peace Corps, were they doing much? What were they up

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: They were doing secondary teaching basically in various parts of the
                    country. The ambassador justified getting a swimming pool at his residence on
                    the basis of Peace Corps kids coming in from the bush could use it. So we got
                    the pool and when they tried to use it, he was not too pleased with that.
                    Anyway, they were doing a lot of teaching. That was where the emphasis was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well after about two years there, 1965, whither? Did you

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well it was interesting. I liked it. The area director for USIA came
                    through, a man named Mark Lewis, with whom I am still in some contact. I didn't
                    realize what a fantastic bullshitter he was.</p>

                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>WILSON: Oh, yes, very good. We were talking and he said, “Let me see some of your
                    writing.” Well the stuff I had written had been translated into French. I didn't
                    have the English. He said, “Oh, this is fine.” It wasn't until three or four
                    years later that I learned he couldn't read or understand a word of French.
                    Okay. Mark came through and he said, “Look, I have seen your name on the list
                    for south Asia. It is about number four or five. If you agree to remain up here,
                    I can save you from going to Vietnam, but you have got to agree now on the spot
                    to stay another tour in Abidjan. I thought it over, and I agreed. Meanwhile in
                    my preference for my next assignment, I said, I requested the Congo. I thought
                    that was a good place to go. I said, I really didn't care where I went. The only
                    places I did not want to go were South Africa and Germany. Sure enough in the
                    middle of December I got a cable ordering me to go to Cape Town. Which was
                    fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Cape Town.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I came on home leave and went to Cape Town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: About the beginning of '66 to the fall of '68.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What job did you have in Cape Town?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I was the branch public affairs officer in Cape Town.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was sort of the head office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well that is an interesting question. You obviously asked it because you
                    know the answer. The public affairs officer was with the embassy in Pretoria,
                    but when the embassy in Pretoria, the ambassador, DCM (Deputy Chief of Mission),
                    political officer, economic officer moved down to Cape Town where the parliament
                    is for four and a half months of the year, the PAO in Pretoria stayed in
                    Pretoria and I in effect was the country PAO. It was a one person post.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>WILSON: It was very tense. Cape Town, if you will, was a bit like Boston. It was
                    the sort of the intellectual, the long haired capital of the country. There was
                    a university, the University of Cape Town, which Bobby Kennedy visited. It had
                    something called the advanced league for southern students which was leading the
                    opposition to the government. But about 20 miles away in a town called
                    Stellenbosch there was the University of Stellenbosch which was an Afrikaans
                    university from which five of the then six prime ministers of the country had
                    graduated. So it was sort of the intellectual root of the Afrikaner movement. I
                    had my first taste of real politics there. I worked obviously with the students
                    at the University of Cape Town, but I also started to work very closely with
                    both the students and some of the administration at the University of
                    Stellenbosch. They speak Afrikaans, and I was dealing with a guy who was
                    director of development there. I discovered he was the head of the so-called
                    Broderbund, the secret South African society, he was head of the area group
                    there, the secret South African Afrikaner group that kept things going. About a
                    year into my term, the ambassador called me in and said that he had word that I
                    was about to be PNGed, persona non grata because of my contacts with the South
                    African Student Union, the English speaking student union. I said, “Mr.
                    Ambassador, I find that hard to believe, because I am doing nothing more than
                    some of my other predecessors did. I may be a little more active. I think the
                    real reason is my contact with the South African Afrikaner students at
                    Stellenbosch. That is what the government doesn't like.” In any case I was
                    prepared to leave along with my wife. We had someone at the South African
                    mission to the UN in New York who was then going to be declared persona non
                    grata if they declared me persona non grata. They didn't, and so I stayed. They
                    were very sensitive about that, about my dealings with the Afrikaners. I
                    realized that whenever I went up there I was a jerk. There is no question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing with them? I mean what were they so
                        upset about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I was a contact. I was maybe showing them films or giving them some
                    books, talking to them, that's all. Which could be a very annoying thing if you
                    want to run a closed society. But interestingly I was there when the Six Day War
                    between the Israelis and Arabs...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: June of '67.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, about that time. And per capita South Africans, particularly the
                    Afrikaners, contributed more to Israel than any other country in the world, per
                    capita. Obviously the U.S. contributed more. But the philosophy behind that was
                    very interesting, namely that we, the Afrikaners, like the Jews, like the
                    Israelis, are God's chosen people and we are surrounded by infidels, by these
                    blacks in the case of South Africans, by the Arabs in the case of the Jews. We
                    feel a great kinship to the Jews because we know what they are going through. So
                    staunch support for the Jews. It was quite nice, it worked out very well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, 1966-1968 was pretty much the high point of our
                        civil rights movement in the United States. Things were really...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well '68 was the assassination of Kennedy and King.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was that, I mean obviously you are doing the USIA
                        thing, how did you handle that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well the first question that always got thrown up at you whenever you are
                    trying to talk about civil rights is, would you want your daughter or son to
                    marry one. I mean that is the first thing out. You have to deal with people as
                    individuals, not by the color of their skin. Actually the more interesting
                    question came up was the Vietnam war, how we dealt with that. In effect the
                    South Africans were more or less supporting us because it was anti-communism.
                    They were violent anti-communists, so we just had to reinforce that a little
                    bit. It wasn't a difficult thing. The race relations in the United States really
                    didn't come to the fore. People knew about it, but it didn't in any way impede
                    our dealings with the South Africans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you find any curiosity maybe saying you know,
                        this is the way we are going to have to, looking at the turmoil you are
                        going through and ours is to the tenth degree more serious. How are we going
                        to do it looking at the way you did it and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: To some extent, but don't forget Cape Town was not Pretoria and
                    Johannesburg was not Durban and there was not that intense feeling. People were
                    more intellectual, more liberal about it with their contacts. So there certainly
                    was an undercurrent, but there wasn't a very major issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was not a theme that you were sort of tasked to
                        drive home. Apartheid is bad, do something.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>WILSON: Well, we didn't come right out and say apartheid is bad, but we said you
                    can not continue to live this way. It is going to bring down your country. Oh,
                    yes, we did that from the start. They accepted that. There is a large naval base
                    near Cape Town called Simon's Town. At one point the local government banned all
                    the Bantu, banned all the blacks, from the area. Suddenly nothing got done.
                    Garbage wasn't being picked up, the streets weren't cleaned. Then there was a
                    big movement, bring back our blacks. Ironically, Stuart, and this is a personal
                    view, the South Africa that I saw at least from the Cape, was more integrated
                    economically at least than was the United States. Because the South African
                    economy could not have existed without the blacks or coloreds, whereas the
                    United States economy could have. In Cape Town we dealt mainly with the Cape
                    coloreds as opposed to the blacks, the Bantu. That was the dominant non-white
                    group. Because of the smallness of the society, obviously many of the Afrikaners
                    had Cape colored ancestors. It is just obvious. The divisions were not that
                    great. One of the educators with whom I worked very closely and studied the
                    United States used to say it doesn't matter to us, Cape coloreds, who is in
                    power. Whether it is the whites, the Afrikaners, or the blacks we are always
                    going to be the bronze spread in between the white bread and the black bread. We
                    are always going to be there. Culturally the Cape coloreds probably felt
                    themselves more akin to the whites than they did to the Bantu, to the blacks.
                    One of the things that I used to work with in one of the black townships there
                    was a stage play group that we helped get some American plays, help them out a
                    little bit. But the Cape coloreds felt much more akin to the whites than they
                    did to the blacks. We had apartheid. One of my good contacts was a major figure
                    in the very liberal movement, and he was banned. He couldn't be around more than
                    three other people socially. I could have him over. He had a house out in the
                    country. He had a dog. He would let the dog out, and if the South African police
                    were to come we would just get out of the room where this guy was so there would
                    be no problem. Ultimately he left the country and went to England. He had gotten
                    a lot of medical grants from NIH (National Institute of Health) to do some
                    study. He was one of the three or four leading figures in thyroid study, in
                    medicine. We gave him a lot of grants. But he was very liberal, and he was very
                    wealthy too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there sort of a good solid demarcation between the
                        Afrikaans speaking and the English speaking people, whites there at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: There wasn't a great demarcation except that the two English speaking
                    newspapers always delighted when an Afrikaner was caught breaking the
                    anti-miscegenation laws. They would publicize this greatly. I knew people in the
                    progressive party of the Liberals and the United Party and the government party
                    and dealt with all of them. It was part of my job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of your job, what were you doing? I mean were you
                        going around and showing films, having books, reading books?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, and going around with newspapers, dealing with the media, developing
                    exchange programs, Fulbright exchange programs, various things. Not Fulbright,
                    because they didn't have a Fulbright commission there, but exchange programs
                    nonetheless.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about with the media? Was there, were they receptive
                        with what we had to distribute?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, both the English, and I found a way to deal with the Afrikaans
                    media. The most influential Afrikaans paper in the country was something called
                    Die Burger. I eventually got to know both their area editing chief and their
                    foreign editor. I made it my point to. That worked pretty well. I mean they
                    didn't embrace me and say we accept all your views, but at least they were
                    receptive to what I had to say. They understood why we were doing what we were
                    doing in our foreign policy in any case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up any feel about what was the end game
                        going to be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No because I don't know if people thought that far ahead. I personally
                    thought the end game would end in bloodshed. I was extraordinarily delighted
                    that it did not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember I was in African INR, not dealing with South
                        Africa. We would sit around and talk, and the consensus was pretty much,
                        this is early 60's, there would be a night of long knives, you know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well the other thing that I found very interesting. On the cultural scene
                    in Cape Town there are a lot of Jews.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought Johannesburg would have had more.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>WILSON: Sure they did, but in the cultural scene there were a lot. Slow to the
                    business scene. I got to know one guy who ran a music store. His name was Hans
                    Kramer who was straight from Germany. I said, “Hans, how can you for god's sakes
                    support the nationalist party?” It was very interesting. He and others would
                    say, “You know we have had to flee three times. We are here. We don't intend to
                    have to flee again. That's why we can support the nationalist party.” Then just
                    as I was leaving, the minister of justice whose name escapes me, who later
                    became a prime, not Vorster, before Jan Vorster. I don't remember at least
                    offhand. They arrested some students up in Johannesburg, and he made a plea to
                    the parents of Jewish students saying please rein in your children. We know you
                    are good, loyal South Africans. But the student movement was a very important,
                    very effective movement. There was a certain amount of anti-Semitism beneath the
                    surface of the Afrikaner, but as I said, they also supported Israel very
                    strongly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about was Soweto in existence when you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just wondering because later on we made a real
                        effort to get into Soweto, I think with our programs and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No we didn't at this point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador or ambassadors while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The ambassador when I was there was a man named William Manning Rountree.
                    A kind of a stuffed shirt, but I got along with him. His wife at one point was
                    so ticked off at some of the wives of the military that she forced them to sit
                    down and read to each other from the book of diplomatic etiquette. I don't think
                    he was a great ambassador frankly. He wasn't bad. He became assistant secretary
                    for something, economic affairs or something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I am trying to capture the times. Did you feel that
                        you had a sense of mission while you were there, that later I think, times
                        changed particularly in the 70's and 80's.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>WILSON: Obviously we did not support apartheid and would let the government know
                    that. I was there when the prime minister, Verwoerd was assassinated in the
                    parliament. They came up with a very novel, I mean it turned out though it never
                    got publicized that the assassin had been dealing with our consular section for
                    a long time to get a visa to go the United States. We were very hesitant to give
                    it to him. The South Africans ended up handling it very nicely. He was not
                    executed; he was put in a mental institution on the basis that only a mentally
                    deficient person would want to kill this great prime minister. Good philosophy.
                    It worked very well. I worked very closely with some of our British allies. The
                    Dutch weren't so easy to work with. They caused a lot of problems with
                    apartheid. It is interesting because those of English speaking descent tended to
                    be more white gloves, you know, didn't want to deal with blacks and non-whites.
                    Whereas the Afrikaners while there was apartheid, you know, they slept with
                    them. You know, a different relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is that way in the United States during this time. You
                        have, you know, northerners who are talking big about doing things, but
                        basically there was to a certain extent in certain areas a much closer
                        integrated society in the south. People had been living and sleeping and
                        eating together for a long time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: People were integrated working with people of all races, and they had to.
                    Non whites clearly outnumbered the whites and were a vital part of the economy
                    of the country. I am going to have to leave you.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing back in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I was in a new experimental program which USIA called “phase two” which
                    is like soap except it wasn't soap. They took first or second tour officers,
                    second tour officers and they wanted to run them through all the activities the
                    agency engaged in, in Washington. So I came back for whatever the period it was
                    supposed to be, and I worked in various elements of the agency from exhibits to
                    motion pictures, etc. One part I wanted to work in I was denied the right to do
                    so. That was our office of congressional liaison. Because the office of
                    congressional liaison was very sacred, they didn't want anybody fooling around
                    with it and seeing what actually happens. The other part that I wanted to work
                    in was on the staff of the advisory commission and information. After
                    considerable discussion I was told no you can't do that because the advisory
                    commission discusses personalities of officers and people, and what they say has
                    to remain private. If you were there, there is a possibility of it getting out.
                    You can't have a Foreign Service Officer doing that, involved in that kind of
                    stuff. Subsequently, I raised a stink, but it didn't do any good. Subsequently,
                    about ten years later, a Foreign Service Officer actually became the staff
                    director. But at that point they figured no Foreign Service Officers. So I did a
                    variety of functions from motion pictures to exhibits to books to wire response
                    services for a period of a year or so. Meanwhile, I applied for what is known as
                    a Congressional fellowship. At that point it was run totally by the American
                    Political Science Association. One USIA officer had the position before me, and
                    he ultimately left the agency. I applied for it, and was told no, we are not
                    sending anybody else on this kind of work because we are afraid you are going to
                    leave the agency. Okay, I went ahead though, and gave them my application. One
                    night I recall, I got a phone call saying I should report to the Civil Service
                    Commission which is what OMB was called at that point, because they wanted to
                    interview me for the Congressional fellowship. Unlike now when foreign affairs
                    fellows just name your own fellowship, you had to interview. Some people were
                    chosen and some weren't. So I said, “What brought about the big change?” They
                    said, “Well let's say the big change was looming on the horizon.” Meaning that
                    Henry Loomis was the director of USIA and he thought it was a good thing to have
                    a USIA person in the fellowship, and I was the person who applied, so they sent
                    me over. I got the fellowship, and I began. You do three or four months of study
                    and lectures, then you go around and try to find yourself a job first in the
                    house and then in the senate, and then you change. At least that is the way it
                    was set up. I did that. My first job was working with Senator William Proxmire
                    from Wisconsin on the senate side. In the middle of that I came back to the
                    agency for some reason, and I ran into the director of foreign service personnel
                    in the elevator. He said, “I hope you are not going to leave us when you finish
                    your fellowship?” I said, “Well you know,” a guy named Halsema, “You know Jim,
                    that really depends on my assignment. What are you going to do with me.” Within
                    two weeks, I got notice that I was assigned as assistant information officer,
                    London, which was very nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That took care of that. It sounds like they wanted to nail
                        the thing down.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, that's true. But I had a major problem, and that is at the time I
                    had a very large dog. Because of what had happened recently in London, in
                    England, there was no longer a six month quarantine, they were not allowing
                    animals in at all. So I began to scout around to see what I could do. The best
                    solution I had was to take the dog into Ireland and get him smuggled across the
                    Irish Sea and bring him in that way. Which was doable. I am not certain it would
                    have been the best thing in the world for an American Foreign Service Officer to
                    do, particularly if he were caught. But that was the only possibility. This
                    didn't sound too plausible to me, so I actually put it in the back of my mind.
                    Then somebody came to me because I was doing some press work in eastern Europe.
                    They said, “Hey, how would you like to go to Moscow as information officer?”
                    They said, “It would require a year of language training in Russian.” Given the
                    atmosphere at the time in Washington, and the fact a guy named Frank Shakespeare
                    was heading up the U.S. information agency. He was very big on service in Russia
                    and eastern Europe. You have got to get those commies. It was a plum assignment.
                    So by accepting the offer to go to the Soviet Union, and learning Russian, I
                    could very easily get out of my assignment to London without blooding any oath.
                    I couldn't have gotten out of my assignment to London saying I don't want to go
                    to London. But saying look, I think I might be more valuable if I learned
                    Russian and went to the Soviet Union, it worked very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a bit about what you picked up working for
                        Proxmire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: What did I pick up?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the senate and how it operated
                        as it related to the world of foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well one of the reasons when I was interviewing on the Hill, I made a
                    point of interviewing with people who had nothing to do with foreign affairs. I
                    wanted to deal strictly with domestic affairs. Proxmire was at time chairman of
                    the joint economic committee, you know, economic matters. When I joined his
                    staff, he was big into this C-5A cost override with the Defense Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: C-5A is a large military transport.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>WILSON: That is correct, it was built by Lockheed and he opposed it very
                    strongly. At the same time he was working on some credit card legislation as
                    chairman of what was at that time called the banking and currency committee. It
                    is no longer called that. Proxmire had a very sharp mind, but was very rigid in
                    his approach to people and his approach to office work. He would come through
                    the office at 9:00. If you weren't at your desk, you were theoretically docked
                    lunch. You couldn't go to lunch if you weren't at your desk by 9:00. He was very
                    rigid about that. He didn't want you to start work before 9:00 either, because
                    one day I had done something put in the ranks of the news people, and put it in
                    the night before, a statement concerning an idea that I had that Proxmire liked.
                    I got a call about 8:30 in the morning from ABC news saying they would like to
                    interview Proxmire for their 9:00 radio news program. Of course you had to do
                    that a bit before. So I went in to the Senator's office, knock on the door
                    before 8:30, and boy did I catch hell. You don't come into my office before
                    9:00. Work begins at 9:00 not at 8:30. I said, “but ABC wants...” “No!” He was
                    very rigid. For example no one in our office was allowed to accept any gifts
                    from any lobbyist of any type with the exception of cheese from Wisconsin. If
                    someone from Wisconsin offered cheese, you could accept, but we had to consume
                    it in the office. He was very rigid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get somebody from the House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, but on the Proxmire thing in addition to working on the C-5A affair,
                    and then there was an amusing incident during that. Someone else on the armed
                    services committee was holding hearings. Senator Proxmire was going to testify.
                    They normally exchanged written testimony beforehand. I was talking to this
                    senator's staff, and he looked at this and said, “Please instruct Senator
                    Proxmire to please ask the questions, to please not get ahead of the script, the
                    way things were laid out, and to not answer the questions before they were
                    asked, and under no circumstances could he discuss things out of order because
                    this would confuse the senator who was asking the question.” The staff said he
                    wasn't very sharp in doing this kind of stuff, and that it would look foolish if
                    Proxmire got ahead of the game, they would look foolish. They were pretty good
                    about that. But the thing I had the most... not only working for Proxmire but I
                    think in my professional career was working with Proxmire's staff on the banking
                    and currency committee on the credit card legislation. Because we, and I was a
                    part of it, perhaps not a vital part, but maybe a vital part, I don't know. We
                    crafted legislation which is still in effect today 25 years later which provides
                    that the maximum liability any credit card holder has if the credit card is lost
                    or stolen or illegally used is $50 maximum, no matter what else happens. If the
                    person loses the credit card and reports it in three days to the credit card
                    company, there is no liability. To me, because I very strongly believe in
                    consumer affairs, this was a major step.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>WILSON: And that part of the legislation still exists. Parts have been modified,
                    but it is there. During the hearings there were two amusing incidents. At one
                    point with the closed hearing of just the senators, they were discussing that at
                    that point in the early 70's people were getting credit cards in the mail
                    unsolicited. The banks claimed they never sent out unsolicited credit cards.
                    Well, we had a case where the author of a book right after WWII called The
                    Secret of Santa Vittoria had his phone listed in Manhattan but under the name of
                    the hero of the book, not under his own name. Lo and behold, he got a credit
                    card. The guy doesn't exist except in the novel. There went the bank's claim
                    they never sent unsolicited credit cards. They used the phone book, just going
                    down the list. Secondly and more amusingly, in the closed session with some of
                    the senators, everyone was taking out their credit cards and was seeing how hard
                    it was to destroy them. They were bending them. Senator Percy, who was on the
                    committee from Illinois, didn't realize what he was saying. They were talking
                    about how these credit cards were usually sent out in September or October
                    before Christmas, and how many people ran up debt they couldn't afford to pay.
                    Senator Percy with a straight face said, “You know it is strange. I never have
                    any trouble paying my credit card bills.” I mean it broke us all up. He had
                    enough money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been president of Bell and Howell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Exactly. He had a lot of money. But he didn't realize the humor of what
                    he was saying. On the house side, I worked with a man from whom I learned a lot
                    about how Congress works. Because this is a much sought after position, many
                    congressional fellows like him because the congressman lets you sit right in his
                    personal office. The congressional fellow had a desk right in his office. They
                    had been taking political scientists, but for some reason they liked me and they
                    took me.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>This is a man named Frank Thompson Jr. from New Jersey. Thompson was the ranking
                    Democratic member on the education and labor committee. He engineered the
                    overthrow of Adam Clayton Powell. He was a very liberal Democrat. I remember one
                    of the leaders, in fact, of the so-called Democratic Study Group, the DSG, but
                    he wasn't very public. He was chairman of a committee which not many people had
                    heard of, and that was the Committee on Administration in the House. Very much
                    of an internal type thing. But I learned quickly that that's what makes the
                    house go around, because the Committee on Administration is responsible for the
                    assignment of offices. They are responsible for all the papers you get, the
                    amount of money you get for running your offices, things that are important.
                    When I went over there, I used to drive to work. They said, “Just go into the
                    House garage, just tell them you are working for Frank Thompson.” I got a
                    parking space directly under the elevator that would lead to the house. I
                    couldn't believe this, but that's the way things worked. You know the House
                    Committee on Administration was an extraordinarily important committee as far as
                    the rest of the House is concerned. Thompson knew how to make legislation work.
                    He was an extraordinarily liberal Democrat, but he worked with extreme
                    right-wing Republicans very nicely, quietly behind the scenes, and they
                    accomplished a lot. They accomplished just a tremendous amount of things.</p>
                <p>Whether it is true or not, he related a story to me. I don't know, it could be
                    true, how when they were trying to during President Kennedy's administration to
                    break the power of the rules committee to push some civil rights legislation
                    through. The number two person on the rules committee was a critical element in
                    getting this thing done. They knew his personal habits. One of his habits was to
                    consume a lot of alcohol and get drunk. They knew exactly when the vote was
                    coming up, and they knew exactly how long it would take him to consume enough
                    alcohol to get him out of the picture. By God, they fed him the alcohol, you
                    know in a convivial sense. He was too drunk to go to the floor to oppose what
                    had been proposed. That is not stuff you read about, but that is the way things
                    often get done. There were a lot of discussions about how they could overthrow
                    this action or that action with the Democratic Study Group coming in. At one
                    point the guy who was to become the future speaker of the house, Mr. Wright, who
                    was a member from Texas. Mr. Wright came in, and I was sitting there. He pointed
                    to me and said, “Who is that son of a bitch in the back. Get him out of here.”
                    Thompson said, “No, no, he is okay. He is a congressional fellow. Whatever you
                    are going to do won't appear for a few years later.” I was able to stay. Part of
                    my job in staying was to know what drinks which congressmen liked. Indeed my job
                    when they came in in the afternoon and put their feet up schmoozing, was to know
                    what drinks to make for them. It was part of my job, and a very important part
                    of the job to keep things going. I knew where to order the liquor from,
                    Gandells. I learned from Thompson how to make things go.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>We were doing stuff on Vietnam, Cambodia. I wrote something for him I thought was
                    pretty good, he wanted some statements, I forgot what he wanted to say. I wrote
                    it pretty well. This was a little before 12:00 or 12:30. He looked at it and
                    said, “This is great. I am taking it with me.” I said, “You can't, Congressman.”
                    “What do you mean I can't?” I said, “I have got to check it with the State
                    Department. I have got to make certain. I have got to get it through several...”
                    He said, “Give me that. It is fact. If I say it on the floor, it is fact. Forget
                    about checking with anybody.” So he took it. I think it was pretty accurate.
                    Some of my training came through, you have got to check the facts. You just
                    can't run with it. You have got to put it through several people to see what the
                    story is. The other thing which I found quite amusing while being up on the
                    Hill, was that in the bureaucracy in the USIA or in State, when I was working
                    there and called people, sometimes they would give you the time of day; more
                    often they wouldn't. When I was calling from the Hill saying this is Wilson
                    calling from Congressman Thompson's office, they jumped to. I mean they didn't
                    know who I was, but by God, I was calling from the Hill. I could get anything I
                    wanted. One of the things I don't think many members of congress realize is if
                    they would get off of the Hill and go to the agency they are interested in
                    regulating or interested in and walk around, they would accomplish a hell of a
                    lot. People would be not scared but impressed. I mean I had access to people at
                    the assistant secretary of state level I would never have access to. I didn't
                    have to go through H or anything like that. I'd just go straight. That was very
                    nice. I was just a little pusher.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Unfortunately Thompson came to a not terribly good demise. He got caught up in
                    the Abscam scandals, which was claiming that he had taken money. He got in with
                    some other people from New Jersey, took money to facilitate certain things from
                    some FBI agents posing as Arab sheiks. I don't know, it is very difficult. You
                    can argue it both ways. They relied on an informant who had been a criminal, an
                    informant who was a criminal. People relied on his testimony as being accurate.
                    They have Congressman Thompson among others on tape at a Georgetown townhouse
                    refusing to accept money that was offered to them. On tape he is refusing to
                    accept money. But the person who is offering it to him claimed he took it later,
                    and this was the former criminal. But no one ever found the money. However, they
                    believed this criminal and not the congressman. I mean you know, the basic
                    question was what the hell was he doing in this townhouse in Georgetown in the
                    first place if he wasn't up to something no good. But literally I sat in his
                    personal office for almost seven months, and only twice during that time did he
                    ever ask me to leave. If something had been going on, I might have been aware of
                    it. I think when he asked me to leave, I think he had some loving on the side.
                    Anyway, before he was actually convicted, while it was on appeal, I was by that
                    time in Geneva, and he came over for an ILO meeting. We went out to dinner. He
                    swore to me that he was not involved at all. Obviously that doesn't mean
                    anything. I was very hurt by this. I thought he was a tremendously good
                    lawmaker. He accomplished things; he knew how to get things done. I learned from
                    that how to work with people whose views I didn't necessarily like. You learn
                    how to compromise. You learn how to quietly get something done, not glamour or
                    media spotlight but you get things done. Thompson and a guy named John Brademas,
                    and Jack Kennedy and one other congressman had all come in together in the class
                    of '48 into the house. They made good friends, particularly Thompson, Brademas,
                    and Kennedy. Thompson and Brademas used to take turns going to a non-existent
                    restaurant up on K Street and sign Jack Kennedy's name. Even after he was
                    President. The bills would come and the game would be to see who had signed his
                    name. He didn't mind paying them. There was no problem. I think one of
                    Thompson's bigger disappointments with Jack Kennedy was they were good friends,
                    all the times he went to the White House, he never went in through the front
                    door. He was always told to go to the back door. He never knew why, but he never
                    got to go in through the front door to see President Kennedy although they were
                    good friends. He used to say you know there are two kinds of Irishmen, “There
                    are the lace curtain Irishman like Jack Kennedy, and then there is the pig shit
                    Irishman like me. Maybe that is why he wouldn't let me through the front
                    door.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you took Russian, this is from '70...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No I didn't take Russian. I went over, I was starting to take it, and
                    they looked at my MLAT scores.</p>

                <p>WILSON: Yes, that I had taken when I had first come into the Foreign Service.
                    They said, “Are you sure you are State Department? Are you sure you are not in
                    the military?” I said, “Yes, I am in the State Department. I had extremely low
                    MLATs. They said, “No we can never teach you Russian.” Then USIA offered me a
                    chance to go to the language school in Monterey. They said, “You can learn
                    Russian.” I said, “Well that didn't intrigue me too much,” if they thought it
                    was going to be that much of a problem. So instead of going to London or instead
                    of going to Russian language school and then to Moscow, I ended up working at
                    that Board of Examiners, BEX on a team for about six or eight months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did this when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: From about the fall of '71 through the spring of '72.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how the exams were conducted
                        and the people you were looking at?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>WILSON: I thought the exams were a bit subjective but fair, particularly the oral
                    exams where I was involved. For the most part the people we were asking to come
                    into the Foreign Service were very well qualified. There were more men than
                    women. Minorities were few in number. In fact, USIA had set up a minority
                    recruitment program sponsored by the Ford Foundation. The head of personnel for
                    the minority recruitment program kept calling me saying, “Did he pass, did he
                    pass?” I said, “George, for God sakes, he hasn't even taken the exam yet. How
                    can I tell you if he passed?” He said, “Well you know what we mean. We want him
                    to pass.” One disappointment that they, and this guy didn't pass, but one of the
                    people that took the exam was an American Indian. We were all rooting for him.
                    He passed, but he did not want to join the Foreign Service. His reason made good
                    sense. He just took this to see how he would do. He said, “I have got more work
                    to help my people here in the United States than I would have to do working
                    overseas.” It was an eye opener, and he was right. We appreciated that. I don't
                    know if I mentioned, but I think, one of the other problems we found I was very
                    unhappy with the security background investigations that took place after we had
                    passed someone on the orals, because there was a great question about a person's
                    sexuality, whether they were homosexual, lesbian etc. which never should come
                    up. We had one case, we passed the woman, and she said quite openly that she had
                    a lover, a male lover, and she was going to take him with her when she got
                    assigned overseas. Well to security this was a no-no. Actually she said she had
                    several male lovers. Now if this had been a male, and he talked about his love
                    life, he would have been very proud, and the security people would have said,
                    hey that's great. But with a female, they were very reluctant. I fought that one
                    and I won. She got taken right afterwards but she came in at the very least. Now
                    subsequently the exams have changed; they are much more formal. They spend a lot
                    more time than just a half day taking orals. I think they still do all exams
                    around the country. I know I had gone up to Boston, Chicago doing oral exams.
                    There was always a mixture of State Department and USIA people on the panels. In
                    my view I liked the system because we didn't care, at least I didn't care what
                    issues. It was irrelevant, to a certain extent. They couldn't be way off the
                    wall, but It was their demeanor, how they handled themselves was very important.
                    Did they get flustered? Could they keep a direction straight? Could they follow
                    a logical theme? These were some of the issues we looked for, that I looked for.
                    It was a three person panel, and we would tell the person right afterward if
                    they passed or not, which I think is good. Now when I was in the OIG (Office of
                    Inspector General) a couple of years ago, they were doing an inspection of BEX.
                    They found a lot of problems. But the way things were going if they reported
                    this to the director general I don't know whatever happened. But they found the
                    exams were skewed. They were not happy with the way things were going. I can't
                    go into detail because I wasn't part of the team. I know back as far as '98 they
                    were having a lot of trouble with the exams and the whole BEX process. When I
                    was there certainly in the early 70's I thought it was a fair process. At one
                    point a member of my team, a woman who I grew very fond of, she became an
                    ambassador, Melissa Wells, and then went back to New York. She was very sharp,
                    very smooth. There was no gender discrimination either on the team or the people
                    who were examined.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: After BEX I went back to become the deputy head of the European Press

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Until the end of '74. From the middle of '72 to the end of '74 when I
                    left to go to Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time what did the press service do, the European
                        press service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We put out a daily wireless bulletin, not only news stories but
                    background from the U.S. government's perspective as to what was happening in
                    different areas of foreign affairs. They wrote original stories to support U.S.
                    foreign policy objectives for placement in the press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you do, look through the press, try to come up
                        with a topic if you thought it would be appropriate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well, you would listen in to the morning conference call between the
                    State Department spokesman and the DOD spokesman and USIA, somebody in there, so
                    you would get to the things that are going to be expected of that day. You would
                    take a look at the hill calendar to see what hearings are coming up, what should
                    be covered. Then you would proceed accordingly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, who were your customers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The customers were the embassies in both western and eastern Europe. The
                    immediate customer was the public affairs section of the embassies. Then you
                    distributed, it was as much for the edification of the State Department officers
                    as it was for placement in the media or just background information for the
                    local media. Because if I can be blunt, a State Department officer overseas has
                    to be informed as to what is going on, and the crap they get out of telegrams
                    doesn't do it. You have to wade through it all. But the ambassador the DCM, the
                    political section, the economic section like to read quickly what the U.S.
                    spokesman said, a summary of the statements to see where the hell things are
                    going. So it became a valuable tool, even if no foreign contact ever saw it, it
                    was extraordinarily valuable for our own internal use.</p>

                <p>WILSON: No, it wasn't for distribution in the States, so we couldn't do that. But
                    overseas you could. Forbidden by law, not policy.</p>

                        had to be kind of careful not to upset the line or whatever it was? In other
                        words you weren't feeling free just to go out in any subject. You had to
                        have something that really was a government position.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes you had to have a government position. You had to make certain you
                    weren't going against the government position. That is very important. How you
                    learned that, you had your contacts in State. You read, as I said, the
                    briefings, and you generally develop the background and knowledge in certain
                    areas, and you use it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the Vietnam War was still going on while you were
                        doing this. Did this play much of a, was this something you were working on
                        a lot?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Some, but as far as the European media was concerned, by the early 70's
                    there was little interest in the Vietnam War. There was interest in the Vietnam
                    Paris peace talks that were going on with Le Duc Tho and Kissinger. All of that
                    was very interesting. But then you took a lot of the statements that came out of
                    Paris or out of Washington. That was very important stuff. But the war itself,
                    not terribly. So let me retrogress for one moment back to Cape Town since you
                    bring this up. In '67 during the height of the Vietnam War, USIA made a film
                    about Vietnam. They spent at that point a couple of million dollars on it. A guy
                    named Bruce Hirshesen made it. It showed pacification programs working very
                    effectively, particularly in the so-called Sulon Section in the 8th district in
                    Saigon. That was the thrust of the film. Well about two or three weeks after we
                    got the first copy of the film, the so-called Tet offensive was launched by the
                    Viet Cong. It was launched from among other places right in this district 8 this
                    film was talking about where the pacification had been so successful. So I sent
                    a cable back which upset many people back in Washington saying, I think we
                    should withdraw this film. It took them about three weeks to respond. They
                    responded by saying no we are not going to withdraw this film. We are going to
                    use it. We spent enough money to make it. Each post is free to use it or not.
                    They were ashamed to admit they had messed up. The other part of this of course,
                    is in the middle of a war where you have real battles, they actually staged some
                    mock battle scenes. That was not the proudest moment of the USIA. Anyway, that
                    is a bit of the Vietnam issue. It was a bit difficult for me in being overseas
                    and trying to explain the Vietnam War, because people were interested while I
                    was in Cape Town. You have to tell a certain line, but I think I toed the line
                    by avoiding the subject as much as I possibly could.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice a change in how the USIA was operating with
                        the advent of Richard Nixon who came on in '69?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well, the leadership of the agency passed from a guy like Leonard Marks,
                    to someone like Frank Shakespeare who as I said earlier was very keen on getting
                    those commies and keeping them in their place. It became very much an
                    anti-communist type of activity. He viewed it as a cold war activity. I never
                    did. I didn't join USIA or State Department to counter the Russians, the Soviets
                    at that time in the cold war. Subsequently when the Berlin Wall came down, they
                    kept talking about there is no need for an information agency now because the
                    cold war, as a cold war vehicle it was no longer needed. I think it was much
                    more than that. I think it countered some Soviet propaganda, Soviet activities,
                    but it was putting forth American culture, American ideas, American music and
                    values, much more than it was a cold war function. Though perhaps it was the
                    cold war function that was used to get the financing out of Congress. But the
                    information agency itself was a very strong representation of American life. I
                    thought that was very important, to get people overseas to understand the
                    American society, not just American movies but something that goes deeper than
                    that. That was my view. Now obviously under this guy Frank Shakespeare,
                    everything was anti-Soviet, anti-communist. That was a bit hard to take. I could
                    survive that.</p>

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>WILSON: Pierre Trudeau was prime minister. There was a separatist movement
                    brewing in Quebec. The central government in Canada had set upon a French
                    language immersion program in all the English speaking provinces to try to get
                    Canadians to speak both languages. The U.S. dollar was strong compared to the
                    Canadian dollar. There were a few trade disputes, but Canada was still our
                    largest single trading partner. So those issues were important. Canadian grain
                    problems, fishing problems between the two countries were significant. But
                    Pierre Elliott Trudeau was the dominant force, and was a major factor in the
                    relationship. Of course, he and Richard Nixon didn't get along so well I guess.
                    An amusing sidelight, when I got up there Nixon had just, Nixon was no longer in
                    office in '75. I got a phone call after three of four months from the head of
                    the USA division in the ministry of foreign service saying did I have any
                    pictures of President Nixon. They would like them. Sure we have got a lot of
                    pictures. I took them over to them. I sent back a cable saying, you know the
                    Canadians liked the president so much they wanted to have his pictures. Three or
                    four months later I had occasion to go over to the ministry of foreign affairs
                    around lunch time. I didn't see anybody I knew, so I walked around to the back.
                    There was a picture of Nixon on the wall. They were throwing darts at it. They
                    would back off, and every time they would hit him, they would take it down and
                    put up another one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador in '75 to '79?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We had a couple. When I got up there, the ambassador was, Tom Enders was
                    there. I don't know whether he was the first one or the second one. Bill, well
                    it will come to me. In any case,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a career officer, Bill Porter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, Bill Porter. I think it was Porter and then Enders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For once rather a career team.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. Porter was excellent. He used to drive around the countryside in his
                    old van, regular plates. This is before people worried about security, not what
                    they would do today I suppose. But he was a very straightforward, very frank
                    ambassador. At one point we were going to have an election out west in British
                    Columbia. He made the comment, somebody had asked him at an event that I had
                    organized, to my horror, somebody had asked him what he thought about the
                    election of a certain liberal person out there. He said, “It would be helpful if
                    he were defeated.” This is not the greatest thing to say. So there was a big
                    commotion and this got picked up by several of the reporters who were the top
                    reporters in the country there, anchormen. They were top guys. Most of the
                    reporters in the State Department came back and they wanted us to say that he
                    was misquoted. I said, “Frank, I will not.” And my boss backed me up. “We could
                    no longer work with these people if we say he was misquoted. We can't do that.”
                    That was a problem. Each of us said if you make us do that, we will resign on
                    the spot. You can have my resignation. The Department backed off, and what we
                    said ultimately was the story is without foundation. Okay, the sharpest of the
                    political guys who was also good friends with the columnist said, “You forgot to
                    say in these stories are without foundation.” He said, “Yes, that is correct.”
                    He said, “Does that mean my good friend, that you are over a hole?” He said,
                    “Yes.” He was over a hole. But Porter was very good, a very fine ambassador. In
                    fact, had been nominated by Kissinger to become ambassador to Saudi Arabia.
                    There was some question as to whether he could do this, did he make a real
                    blunder, they said. Porter said, “If you want to rebuke me, fine, but then I
                    don't go to Saudi Arabia for you.” And they needed him. He was acceptable to the
                    Saudis. The oil crisis had passed. He went off to Saudi Arabia. He was well
                    respected in the Foreign Service because he started out as a code clerk and he
                    worked his way up. He was a very solid ambassador. Then we got Tom Enders who
                    was termed by one of the political journalists who could write football, Too
                    Tall Enders, after the Dallas tight end, Too Tall Jones. Enders was a very sharp
                    ambassador. He and I got along very well. More importantly his wife and I got
                    along very well. I didn't set out to do that, but his wife was very interested
                    in contemporary and modern American art. So I became designated as the person to
                    deal with her on art because she said, “David, I know you will tell me honestly
                    what to do, whereas the PAO I don't trust. He is just too diplomatic. He won't
                    tell me what he thinks.” So I got to become the designated art person for Mrs.
                    Enders. I went to Toronto and looked at all the art galleries. Not all the time,
                    but on occasion. That was rather interesting because she was a very, a woman of
                    very direct sentiments. She didn't hide them. She was of Italian origin,
                    probably about 4'11”, 4'10”, 4'11” and he was 6'8”. So it was a very interesting
                    couple. But they got along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was within the embassy sort of the feeling towards
                        Trudeau at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>WILSON: There was a sense that he could be a mischief maker and that he was very
                    much a Canadian nationalist, which he was. He was both, but he was not
                    anti-American by any means. He at that time was having problems with his wife,
                    Margaret. That caused some difficulty, particularly when she walked into my
                    office. Our press offices were in the same building as the press club, and she
                    mistakenly went into, she thought she was going into the press club, and she had
                    mental and psychological problems and she came into the office. She wanted to
                    sit down and talk all about Pierre. It was kind of an interesting time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: With great trepidation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everybody knew she had problems, and this was not
                        something to either take advantage of, I mean it was something to keep under
                        cover. I mean keep the lid on and not ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Sure, that's right. And by the time she came, some RCMP(Royal Canadian
                    Mounted Police) people came right up and they were there. It was very helpful.
                    It was interesting because our DCM at the time was a bachelor and traveling in
                    very vaulted circles. Actually he was out on some boat parties with Margaret.
                    You just had to be careful, and we were. Things were all right. But there were
                    problems. One of the problems was, as I said before, agriculture. We took a very
                    tough line. The minister of agriculture, I don't know why I remember his name,
                    it just came to me, a guy named Whalen, was extraordinarily critical of
                    Ambassador Enders, and called for his recall in public. Of course that wasn't to
                    be. Meanwhile Enders was studying German from the American Institute. This was
                    sort of known around. One of the reporters from the Canadian press came to me
                    one day. This was really a problem for him. He said, “You know Enders is
                    studying German; they have asked for his recall. Does that mean he is going to
                    be kicked out?” I said, “Hell no, he is a good ambassador. If he is studying
                    German it is probably to go to Germany because in the American Foreign Service,
                    Germany is a more important post than Canada.” Which it happened to be true. I
                    didn't expect it would be published.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was, oh, God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, in a modified version. It was published. It was okay. I explained to
                    Enders, I went over to the embassy which was in another building, I went over
                    and explained it to him. He had a big smile on his face, and he looked up at me
                    and he said, “You know, we will just wait for an opportunity, and we'll kick the
                    bastards in the balls.” That was his operating philosophy, and we did. It was no
                    big deal. At the time I was feeling very put upon.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about on the cultural side. I mean it is always a
                        problem. People buy Time Magazine and Maclean's magazine. I mean, you know,
                        if you follow it at all, Canadian affairs, as I do sort of from afar, you
                        hear this again and again and again. I mean the cultural dominance and where
                        the advertisements go and all that. You must have been right in the thick of
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean how did you deal with it both officially and just
                        sort of with your contacts? They must have given you a rough time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well, if it was a question of advertising in a magazine, the Canadian
                    version of Time usually did things like that, but there was also the television
                    question. This was much more complicated, the television was much more
                    complicated than the magazines because the Canadian cable companies were picking
                    up American channels, and not paying for the pickup. Then they would use
                    Canadian advertisers, put in where they wanted to. Well, we in spite of our, the
                    Helsinki CSCE (Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe), where we
                    talked about openness and free access to information, and criticized the Soviets
                    for blocking things, we, the United States, threatened to block our own signals.
                    I mean, this goes against everything that we stood for as a country. So the
                    Canadians said we can't do that. I said, we can and we will. They said, we can
                    go behind your back and still pickup the U.S. signals. This was a major problem,
                    particularly to some of the Congressmen, Moynihan from New York who said, “What
                    was going to happen to the signals?” This was a big problem. We attempted to
                    block our own signals. The Canadians continued to pick it up quietly, and that
                    part of it went away. Could you get a Canadian tax deduction for advertising on
                    American television? No. But what the American networks did, the American
                    stations did on the border was to lower their rates to Canadians so that it was
                    in effect a tax deduction for the Canadians. The issue of Time Magazine was, you
                    know, several of the American anchors were Canadian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom Brokaw and Morley Safer and several others.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: At one point Morley Safer came up to do a story on this, and I was
                    helping him. We were sitting on a bench in front of parliament. He took out a
                    lighter to light a cigarette. He said, “You see this lighter?” “Yes.” He said,
                    “That is the lighter I gave to whoever to set the village of My Lai on fire.” I
                    said, “You're kidding!” “Yes,” he said, “we set that up for the television
                    cameras.” I couldn't believe it. He was very honest. The issue ultimately went
                    away without any punitive legislation on either side, but there was just a lot
                    of rhetoric. The Canadians never allowed tax deductions for advertising in the
                    Canadian version of an American magazine. I believe that the Americans lowered
                    the rates, so they were able to accomplish that. It was a major issue. It was a
                    good substantive issue, a good fun issue to deal with. I enjoyed it anyway.</p>

                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Oh a little but not a hell of a lot. You know there was an issue in
                    Maclean's right after I got there. A woman named Heather, I forgot her last
                    name, wrote an article about all the American campers coming up with their
                    campers coming up to Canada. We should toss them bombs. Subsequently, one of our
                    better contacts in Canada became and is still the editor-in-chief of Maclean's.
                    She is certainly not anti-American. They realize the relationship. Sometimes you
                    have, particularly during an election period, you have to make noises about the
                    giant to the south.</p>

                        very fact that you say something about Canada can get yourself in the front
                        pages.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Canada was very sort of schizophrenic about the United States. It is too
                    easy to say, well, they dislike us. They don't. We are very much like them. In
                    fact the Canadian journalists were hired by American television networks because
                    they are not American and can use Canadian visas and Canadian passports to get
                    into countries like Iran where we couldn't. They made a point of wearing
                    Canadian flag on their ass, so that they were not American. They are very proud
                    of that fact that they are not American. As years have gone on, Canadians have
                    built up their own culture. They have a group of seven painters who are very
                    well known in Canada. They have their own film industry, although it is small.
                    One of the things they are doing that irked Americans, the American film
                    industry, many American television commercials are made in Canada because of
                    lower rates of salary scales for the people they have to pay. They have big
                    studios in Toronto for making these things. They still do. They are very big in
                    films. We have, as I say, an American film festival there, Walt Disney. Walt
                    Disney, they are very careful of their image, and we had somebody come up from
                    Disney world, several characters including Mickey Mouse. Well Mickey Mouse lost
                    her birth control pills. This was a major problem. We quietly figured out how to
                    get the birth control pills. Disney would have skinned us alive if it had come
                    out in the press that Mickey Mouse was a girl taking birth control pills.</p>

                <p>WILSON: Yes. We worked that out very quietly and very carefully. But they are
                    very interested in American film; we did several American film festivals. And I
                    for whatever reasons, became the wine officer of the American embassy. It wasn't
                    just drinking wine but one of our high goals, one of our mission goals, was to
                    open the Canadian provincial markets to American wine, particularly Ontario and
                    Quebec, where the liquor control boards control wines that come in or not come
                    in to the country, or what wines could be sold in the liquor control board
                    stores. That was a major issue. We were fairly successful in opening up the
                    Ontario liquor control board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My understanding is Canada was sort of the Tory stronghold
                        in a way, I mean you are talking about Tories going back to the
                        Revolutionary War. Quebec has its own ethos which is not particularly
                        anti-American, it is anti-British at the same time. Then you have the west
                        going all the way to British Columbia which operates on a completely
                        different set of principles. Did you find, I would think this would prove to
                        be a difficult country to represent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: There were obviously strong differences. Well, the west was much more
                    liberal, British Columbia, than Calgary and some of the other parts of the west,
                    all the grain and oil areas of the west. We had a consul general in Quebec City
                    named Terry McNamara. Right after the votes that gave the Parti Quebecois, the
                    PQ power in Quebec province, there was big talk about secession. Quebec was
                    going to secede and become a country unto itself. Well the press talked to
                    McNamara, and they quoted him as saying, “Well it could be the sixth largest
                    country going, and we would be pleased to have a military alliance with Quebec.”
                    Of course it was not U.S. policy, and Terry ultimately denied saying this. Tom
                    Enders and I discussed that in Enders' office We talked. Enders liked Terry
                    McNamara.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Terry is a feisty guy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, he is a good guy. I like Terry. We talked and we talked to Terry by
                    phone. We put out a statement saying this was completely untrue. Terry had never
                    said this. As we were walking out of the office, Enders looked up at me with a
                    big wink and said, “But do we know he didn't say it?” Much more was said between
                    Tom and me, but we knew he had said it. We certainly protected him. At the same
                    time, some of the maritime provinces were very upset. I happened to be in the
                    library one day at lunch time, and a call came through from the premier of Nova
                    Scotia himself. I forget who it was. “Is this the information officer?” “Yes.”
                    He told me who he was and he said, “Can you tell me what procedures one must
                    follow in order to become a state of the United States?” Of course, I said, sure
                    I will get back to him. Before I got back to him, I wanted to make sure it
                    really was the premier. This required some instant political reporting. Then I
                    had to find out what the hell you had to do to become a state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That isn't something exactly on the tip of our
                        tongue.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>WILSON: The answer is there is no fixed procedure. There is nothing set out in
                    the Constitution. You can state how other states have become states and how
                    Congress votes them in, but there no fixed rules. But he was serious. As soon as
                    Quebec, the Parti Quebecois, came in with an independence policy in Quebec, he
                    was concerned about breaking off from western Canada. This is where information
                    work, public affairs work becomes really political. That was a very political
                    type of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, God, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We had a consul general, a lovable guy but not overly intelligent, a guy
                    named Ron Gaiter. Again his offices were separated from mine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ron Gaiter, I knew him vaguely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: And he called me one day and says could he come see me? “Yes.” I said,
                    “What's up, Ron?” “I can't talk about it on the phone, but before I get there, I
                    need to know is Alexander Solzhenitsyn a member of the communist party.” I could
                    check that out pretty easily. Ron came up the hill and we talked. He said, “This
                    is very confidential, but as you know Solzhenitsyn is in Canada.” I knew that
                    vaguely. He said, “ Solzhenitsyn has applied for a visa to go to the United
                    States, and is he a member of the communist party?” I said, “Yes, he is Ron. Any
                    writer who has done any work has to be a member of the communist party.” He
                    said, “Well I can't give him a visa.” I said, “Why? For God sakes he has been
                    invited to address a joint session of Congress. I don't know what you have got
                    to do but call somebody on a secure line. Do what you have to but for God sakes
                    you have got to get him a visa.” Ultimately he did. But I mean he was serious.
                    The rules say that...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well ,once in awhile we get hoisted on that petard. I am
                        an old consular officer, and I have seen this, where people just don't use
                        their common sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>WILSON: Exactly. But you said a word that I think pervades my time in the Foreign
                    Service. I am a strong believer in it. Common sense. You have rules. They are
                    not made to be broken, but they are made to be applied with common sense. That
                    is very important in dealing with the Foreign Service. Another thing that not
                    too many people do in the Foreign Service is learn to take individual
                    responsibility. It is easy to hide behind the bureaucracy. In our later
                    conversation I learned the boss of USIA, Charles Z. Wick, who was a
                    son-of-a-bitch. He had one credo. This was who is responsible? I want to know
                    the name of the individual that is responsible. I don't want to be told it is a
                    bureaucracy. I want to know the name of the individual. That is very important,
                    and I have tried to follow that rule. It's critical. Who is responsible, for
                    good as well as bad, I mean who is responsible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you get involved any other way with the Quebec
                        separation movement? I mean was this sort of a minefield that one had to be
                        very careful about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. We did not, in our role, we did not get involved in that issue at
                    all. Aside from going to Quebec City as a tourist or going to Montreal to see
                    some baseball games, or going into Quebec province to eat, we stayed very much
                    away from that issue. Tom Enders though, that issue didn't worry him. He figured
                    the Canadians would take care of it themselves. What he was concerned about, and
                    what he found he was helpless to do anything about was the relationships between
                    Canadian provinces and American states. Because by natural affinity and
                    geographic affinity, they were having to do a lot of things together. Enders was
                    furious. He decreed that nobody in the States should have any dealings with
                    Canada that he was unaware of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is sort of like saying sun stand thou still, you
                        know.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>WILSON: He could do that. After this decree went out and State Department
                    certainly approved of it, you saw in the paper that the prime ministers of
                    Quebec and Ontario were meeting with the governors from Vermont and New York to
                    discuss signage on the roads going up and down. He was fit to be tied. He said,
                    “I thought that this was not supposed to happen.” “Mr. Ambassador, there is not
                    a thing anybody could do about it.” The meeting was going to happen. But it was
                    frustrating, because if you are supposed to represent U.S. interests, you want
                    to know about this. But there was no physical human way of controlling it.
                    Enders had to learn that that was the case. But we did not get involved really
                    in the Quebec separatist issue, we did not get involved on the Quebec side of
                    the separatist issue. We reported, of course, what happened in parliament, what
                    Trudeau was saying, what his advisors were saying. But we didn't get involved in
                    that. Now one of the things that I did in Canada was to take some of the
                    magazines USIA produced which we were distributing free, and put them on sale.
                    Now this caused some problems back in Washington. I got it cleared through the
                    general counsel's office. My philosophy was if these magazines were any good,
                    people will use some of their disposable income to purchase them if they have
                    any meaning to them. If they don't, big deal. The real issue was a magazine
                    called Problems of Communism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excellent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: A very well done scholarly magazine. We put that one at a price that was
                    not very much, I think it was ten dollars a year for four issues. Ten Canadian
                    dollars versus U.S. I got a call from someone on Trudeau's staff saying we got
                    your notice. We are not going to pay for that. You are still going to give it to
                    the prime minister. I said, “No. If you want it, you have got to pay for it.”
                    There was hemming and hawing, and they paid for it. Washington was very upset,
                    because initially our 600 distribution went down to about a little over 300. But
                    inside of a year it was back up to about 450, and these were honestly 450 people
                    who really wanted the magazine. The economic impact wasn't nearly so successful,
                    but people bought it. It was a good experiment, only in Canada. I suspected we
                    should have done it in other parts of the world, but no one wanted to take the
                    risk. But it was a very important operation, and I got approval from the general
                    counsel's office, and we did it. We used an American firm based in Toronto for
                    distribution. The magazines were mailed to them; they mailed them out. We had
                    cleaned the ads. We didn't have to worry about the distribution anymore. It was
                    a very interesting experiment. I enjoyed setting it up; I enjoyed seeing that it
                    worked, and found we had people who really cared about the product to buy
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this of course has been done. I know we used to give
                        away books in the Arab world, but give them to book stores and have them
                        sell them. It worked much better because otherwise people, if it is a
                        freebie, it sort of gets in the way.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>WILSON: We were still doing that several years ago when I was involved in the
                    Bureau of education and cultural affairs. We were giving books to people and
                    letting them sell them in Africa and Latin America, but that's another issue.
                    Let me just back up. After my Hill experience, and after not getting into the
                    language program, I did work a year, and I am sorry I forgot about that, at the
                    Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA). This was before I went to work in
                    the European press office. I was there at a time just at the signing of the SALT
                    I agreement. That was a very stimulating period as far as I was concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I was the, the title was press officer. In fact there were three people
                    there, myself, and a woman, and a deputy head of the office, a guy named Ralph
                    Smith, and this fellow Dave Dorgiss. He was dealing with bigwigs. But he again
                    taught me a very good lesson on bureaucracy. When I first came there he said,
                    “Young man, I want you to remember one thing. I want you to protect my tail. If
                    you protect me particularly vis a vis the people above me so I don't look bad, I
                    don't make any mistakes, I will take good care of you in your ratings.” A very
                    simple statement. Just very good. We got the SALT I agreement signed. I learned
                    there was a leak of something on the U.S. position. Of course, there was a leak
                    about the U.S. fallback position. This just brought the FBI over, a lot of
                    questions. With that, of course, the first place they look is public affairs.
                    Obviously public affairs is the last place somebody is going to leak something,
                    but it is the first place you look. They weren't concerned so much about the
                    U.S. position, presenting it to the Soviets, but they were concerned about the
                    damn fallback position, because that hadn't been presented to the Soviets. That
                    kind of blew over, and the agreements were signed. Then they were talking about
                    what was going on next. The deputy head of the office had a good sense of humor,
                    and he decided that the next talks, and he talked to somebody in the graphics
                    design department, and he said, “The next talk should be called the 'follow on
                    arms restriction talks'.” FART. He had some letterhead made up. This is because
                    when they did the SALT they were warned that people were just going to be using
                    that, and indeed they were. There were some cartoons with salt, somebody putting
                    salt on a bird's tail, etc. But the follow-on arms restriction talks, I have
                    some of the letterhead stationery, never got used. That became START. But it was
                    a good group of people to work with. The agency (ACDA) was small. You worked
                    with people in State, Harriman was about. It was just a good time.</p>

                <p>WILSON: Correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Five and a half years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we are talking almost '86?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No, '84. Because I was there for almost all of '79, '80, '81, '82, '83,
                    through August of '84.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I started out as the deputy public affairs counselor. I ended up as the
                    public affairs counselor. I could have stayed longer had I wanted to. We will
                    get into that. I was in Ottawa, and I had been trying to get a transfer out.
                    They said, “No there is no way possible.” So I had just renewed my housing lease
                    in Ottawa in November. I got a call from Washington in December saying we need
                    you to go to Geneva immediately. I was a little put out, because it was “no, you
                    can't leave, you certainly can't leave mid-cycle.” But they had an emergency
                    opening. The person who had the job I was to go into had just quit, and they
                    needed somebody because they had the arms control talks going on, and the PAO
                    needed help. I had worked in the arms control agency, so they thought that was
                    pretty significant, and they wanted me over there. So I pulled my family out in
                    mid-January, and we came by New York and went to Geneva directly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what was the status of talks when you got there in
                        January of 1979?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>WILSON: Well the arms talks hadn't done much. They were just sort of kicking
                    around. But there were a lot of other side talks that were going on at the UN in
                    Geneva, particularly one dealing with UNCTAD, the United Nations Conference on
                    Trade and Development, to help the developing countries. They had a major UNCTAD
                    meeting, and I being very enthusiastic plunged right into it the day after I got
                    there. I was very excited; we were going to achieve something. We had the New
                    York Times and the Wall Street Journal there. The New York Times gentleman said,
                    “Relax, nothing is going to happen.” I said, “We are on the verge of something
                    great.” We stayed up, a couple of all-nighters. It was very exciting. I started
                    to talk to some of the colleagues around me, and one was a lady from the State
                    Department legal office. I said, “Oh what are you doing here?” She said, “Well,
                    we have to be around in case they reach an agreement.” “Can't they just send it
                    back to you?” “No, not really, we need to be here.” So the talks went on for
                    three or four days, crisis marathon state. Nothing happened. By the time I left,
                    every other year these same talks went on and nothing happened. Nothing still
                    happens, but it was exciting the first time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well tell me, did you find, you are talking about there is
                        a whole series of talks that were going on, people who were living or sent
                        there by the Soviets or Americans, whoever. I mean there must have grown up
                        sort of a Geneva culture.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a bit about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Sure. The Geneva culture was if you were attending a conference, and I am
                    going to exclude arms control for a moment. We will get back to that. If you are
                    attending a conference, the sessions usually begin three or four o'clock in the
                    afternoon. They break for supper, and then they go into the evening. Now there
                    was one point a couple of years into my tour where they were doing again another
                    one of these UNCTAD conferences to help the developing nations. The developing
                    nations always said, if you will just take half of the budget you developed
                    countries are spending on arms and give to us as developing nations, the world
                    will be a safer place for democracy. These talks always went on to three or four
                    o'clock in the morning. One day the UN interpreters, these are the ones who do
                    the simultaneous interpretation, went to the head of the conference, the
                    president of the conference and said, “Look, we are tired. We are not going to
                    stay up and do interpreting past midnight.” The head of the conference took
                    great umbrage at this and said, “We don't need you.” Midnight came. The
                    interpreters went. The conference went on for about 20 minutes and it fell into
                    total disarray like a Tower of Babel. Nobody could understand anybody else. It
                    was humorous, it was great. Interpreters are a very important part of UN
                    procedure, any international procedure, and they are well paid.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what was the reason for this going on past
                        midnight?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It became part of the culture. They start late in the afternoon because
                    they had been working late the preceding night so they sleep in. They get up and
                    sort of have a late breakfast or lunch, and they begin their talks about three
                    or four in the afternoon. That's the way it works. Not all meetings obviously,
                    but certainly the UNCTAD meeting was that way. Some of the CCD, the Committee on
                    Disarmament was that way. From a working perspective it was very exciting
                    because we always had a lot of political appointees come in to head up these
                    various delegations from the United States perspective. It was fun to deal with
                    them and talk with them. They would come in, the congress would begin on a
                    Monday, they would come in on Saturday night or more likely a Sunday afternoon
                    or Sunday morning, and they would have a big meeting on Sunday afternoon, Sunday
                    evening and state what the U.S. position was. We all would nod and say yes, yes,
                    yes. Then they would begin their round of meetings, and not much usually
                    resulted from them, but they had a good time. We had a good time at least at
                    first. There was one conference dealing with hunger. Our ambassador who was a
                    good democratic political appointee at the time, was a guy named Bill Vanden
                    Heuvel, who claimed he had worked with the old predecessor of the CIA. He was a
                    good guy. A liberal Democrat, he had been a Congressman from the silk stocking
                    district of New York. His claim to fame was to sit between Jimmy Carter and Ted
                    Kennedy to keep them apart from each other, keep them from talking to each
                    other. Anyway, there were two things I learned from him. I learned several
                    things from him. One when he was talking about Mrs. Carter coming over, I think.
                    We were discussing her coming over for whatever meeting it was going to be. We
                    were talking about getting all the other ambassadors on board. I said, “Mr.
                    Ambassador, what does it matter what these other countries think or do?” Then he
                    gave me a lecture on the importance of multilateral diplomacy. It was a good
                    lesson on how it works. But when we had the food conference, he implored the
                    delegation that came in from Washington, I forget who headed it up, he said,
                    “Please may I ask you all delegates stand up. Please, you are Americans. While
                    you are at this conference, don't go to all these good restaurants in Geneva and
                    eat yourselves sick. It doesn't look good if you are discussing food and hunger,
                    and going to and eating at all these good restaurants.” It was a good point. It
                    was a very good point. Not that anyone would listen to him, but it was a good
                    point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was our setup there? Were you sort of assistant
                        and then finally PAO for all the various...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, any of the delegations that came in. The PAO could take his choice
                    of any of the delegations that he wanted to service, and I serviced others.
                    Sometimes we would trade off, and we would try to put out statements for the
                    people. For the leaders of the delegations, we would try to get them interviews
                    with the various media, not only American media but international media as well.
                    That is what it consisted of. It was a major media operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well during the five years you were there, I mean did the
                        Swiss play much of a role or were they just the hosts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: They were the hosts, but in order to achieve our objectives with people
                    coming in and out at airports, etc., we found it very useful to be good to the
                    Swiss, very nice to the Swiss. The Swiss often resented foreigners, but they
                    enjoy living off the proceeds of foreigners. So we got along with the chief of
                    protocol and with his assistants. We made sure we worked things out with them,
                    very important. One of the problems that we faced, of course, was the
                    relationship between the U.S. mission to the UN in Geneva and the bilateral
                    embassy in Bern, and the relationships between ambassadors, particularly when
                    important figures came in. Who was to greet them? Which ambassador went out to
                    the airplane, walked at the end of the tarmac. It was a very touchy subject, and
                    we learned to deal with that. The underlings kind of laughed about it, but the
                    ambassadors took it very seriously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you get together with the PAO in Bern and sort
                        of, you know, sit there and figure out how are you going to deal with these
                        egos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. for example, one of the things we did was once a year, we would
                    invite the ambassador form Bern to come and address the American club, at one of
                    the big hotels in Geneva. That always made her feel good. But the real thrust of
                    the problem reached a boiling point when somebody like the Secretary of State
                    came or the Vice President came or the President came in. If the President did
                    go through Geneva, who is the first guy to greet him, or in this case, guy or
                    woman? Then we ran into another problem. One of the ambassadors, a democratic
                    appointee ambassador, a guy named Marvin Warner from Ohio, I think Cincinnati,
                    was a bachelor, as was at the time our ambassador Vanden Heuvel. They used to
                    compete for various things, but right in the middle of all this, Ambassador
                    Warner was stopped by the Swiss police from bringing a young woman to an
                    official Swiss government dinner in Bern. The Swiss police told us quietly this
                    is a known prostitute. We cannot have her coming in to sit with the President of
                    Switzerland, etc. Warner was very indignant. He was going to make a diplomatic
                    incident of it. I counseled our ambassador to go and talk to him. Tell Marvin
                    Warner to call it off. He didn't, but the State Department ultimately told him
                    to cool it, so ultimately he cooled it. When he went back, when his
                    ambassadorship ended or he was recalled, he ended up going to jail in the United
                    States for some fraud or some of these doings. He was not the most pleasant
                    character to deal with, but those things happen in any situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course Switzerland is considered a cozy spot to send
                        somebody who gives money, but you don't want to put an awful lot of trust in
                        their ability.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, in the bilateral relationship. The problem though for the ambassador
                    in Geneva, our ambassador, is if you got an activist in there, and we had one
                    career guy who was very activist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Jerry Hellman. He wanted to follow the issues, and he knew the issues. He
                    wanted to get involved with the delegations on all the issues. Of course the
                    delegations coming out of Washington, you know, what the hell does this guy
                    know? He doesn't know anything; keep him out. But he did know something. It was
                    a major problem because our ambassador felt he had nothing to do unless he dealt
                    with these delegations. He was just a housekeeper. Hellman really got involved.
                    Now one of our other ambassadors, a political ambassador, a guy named Jeff
                    Swaebe, who then went on to become ambassador to the Kingdom of Belgium in
                    Brussels, happened to have been a good friend of the President. At one point,
                    this is a true story, the director of the Arms Control Disarmament Agency came
                    out for some talks. In an obligatory way, he had to “brief” the sitting U.S.
                    ambassador. He sort of went in and did it with a lick and a promise, as if to
                    say you dumb bastard, you don't know what the hell I am talking about do you? He
                    didn't say that obviously but that was his attitude. Well, this got back to the
                    President, and the director of the Arms Control Agency was not long for this
                    world as director of the Arms Control Agency. I mean, he didn't take this
                    ambassador seriously. That was a major mistake. He belittled him; he downgraded
                    him, and paid the price. This guy had a lot of influence with the White House,
                    and the reason he had influence with the White House was his property in
                    California was contiguous with the Reagan property in California, and it was
                    contiguous with the property of a guy named Charlie Wick. The wives used to
                    carpool, so the wives were very close. Jeff Swaebe who had been with Florsheim
                    shoes and then with the major department stores, he had been head of the major
                    department stores, put together a consortium of retailers to refurbish the White
                    House when Ronald Reagan came in. This was for the White House. This wasn't for
                    Ronald Reagan to take home afterwards as Clinton seems to have done. So he had a
                    certain amount of influence with President Reagan, and certainly with Charlie
                    Wick who had a lot of influence with President Reagan. So if you came out, you
                    had to learn very quickly that you could not just slough off the ambassador to
                    the commission in Geneva. You couldn't just ignore him, or at least you
                    shouldn't just ignore him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your role because with the exception of
                        Hellman, most of your ambassadors and others were political appointees, and
                        sort of caretaking things? I would have thought that, I mean, when you are
                        acting as a spokesperson for the various delegations that come out, at the
                        same time you are working for the ambassador. I would think this would get
                        kind of tricky.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>WILSON: There was another political appointee, a guy named Gerald Carmen who now
                    runs Carmen Associates. He had a tremendously lousy personality. He had been a
                    used car parts dealer in New Hampshire. He had helped Reagan overcome a deficit.
                    They brought him down to Washington and made him head of the General Services
                    Administration (GSA). After about a year and a half, I don't know how this came
                    to his attention, but he suddenly learned that several of the wives,
                    particularly Wayne French Smith's the attorney general and a couple of the other
                    wives, were using government cars to go shopping and do things like this. He
                    started to crack down on that. Apparently some people got to the White House and
                    said, get him out of there. Get him out of the GSA. So they did, and they sent
                    him to Geneva. He was a decent guy, he really was, but he had no personality. At
                    one point, my offices were right down on the ground floor and he had to take the
                    elevator, or anybody did, to get upstairs where his office is and the executive
                    offices were. One day I was standing at the elevator when he came in and he
                    said, “What are you doing right now? Tell me what you are working on.” I told
                    him. He said, “You know, you are damn lucky.” I said, “What do you mean, Mr.
                    Ambassador?” He said, “I don't know what I am doing. I haven't got anything to
                    do. You are lucky to have something to do.” We got off to a good relationship.
                    He tried to get me to stay on. He wanted me to stay on past the time I was
                    there. I had already stayed on. He said, “In your Foreign Service culture, is it
                    true you can't leave unless I give you permission to leave?” I said, “Yes, Mr.
                    Ambassador that is correct.” He said, “Is it also true that no successor can
                    come in unless I approve of this successor.” I said, “Yes, that is correct, Mr.
                    Ambassador.” He said, “Well you tell Washington that I don't approve of your
                    successor no matter who it is. You can't leave.” So we sat back for a little
                    while. Meanwhile, this is true. This shows you how the bureaucracy works.
                    Charlie Wick who was then director of USIA, had then come out to Geneva. He had
                    known me, and he wanted me to come back and break my tour six or eight months
                    early to head up, become the first program director, for something called
                    Worldnet, which was USIA's new innovative television service. I was a little
                    hesitant, but he wanted me to do that. I said, “Well I have got two kids in
                    school. I really can't pull them out.” He said, “Well, they can stay in Geneva
                    until the cycle is over.” “Yes, but the housing allowance stops and the school
                    allowance stops. I really can't do it.” They said, “Well, we will see about
                    that.” The USIA person said, “Well if Charlie Wick wants you back here, you have
                    got to come back.” Well I also discovered, there was a certain regulation at
                    USIA that said I could not come back and get per diem on a temporary assignment
                    in Washington if I were going to be assigned to Washington afterwards. So we
                    went back and forth on this for awhile. Wick said he wanted me back in May to
                    deal with a NATO 25th anniversary meeting or whatever it was, to help do that
                    one, because I had dealt with arms control stuff, and he wanted me to deal with
                    NATO. That's fine. I talked to the personnel people, and they said, “You know
                    you really can't get per diem, and we really can't continue your housing in
                    Geneva once you leave.” So I remembered what the ambassador said to me, and I
                    said, “Well you know,” and by that time my successor had been named. I said,
                    “Well you know the ambassador doesn't want to accept Chris as my replacement.
                    Moreover he doesn't want me to leave, and he won't approve my leaving.” There
                    was dead silence on the other end. They said, “Well do you think you can
                    convince him?” I said, “I don't know; I'll talk to him, but do you think you
                    could find a way to keep my wife and kids here while I go back and on TDY and to
                    pay me my full per diem while I am in Washington.” Within an hour, the director
                    of personnel called me herself and said, “We have found a way to meet all of
                    your requests. Do you think you can get the ambassador to let you go?” Well I
                    knew I could because he told me if I wanted to go I could. I said, “Well I will
                    get back to you in a week.” Which I did. I told them yes, I found a way to do
                    this. The ambassador will let me go. But it is a good example of how you can
                    deal with the bureaucracy. You need to deal with it, you need to know where you
                    want to go, and you need to be strong in your own interpretation of regulations,
                    and you need to have something to, not hold over their heads, but something that
                    they want that you can provide. That worked extraordinarily well.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well tell me, while you were there, what were the
                        hot-bellied things that were going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I became PAO when the USIA director fired the former PAO because he spent
                    a lot of time on a boat, and the ambassador noticed this, that he would come in
                    from lunch after a two or three hour lunch. The ambassador would notice this. So
                    I presume, and I don't know for a fact, that the ambassador just called his
                    friend, the director of USIA and said, “Just get his guy out of here.” When this
                    happened, I happened to be in Paris for a conference. I got back and the
                    ambassador called me up and said, “Well, now that your old boss is gone,”
                    because I had not been happy with the fact that they had a USIA car. They really
                    didn't need one, and the guy was using it to go to and from his boat. He said,
                    “Well now that Hank is gone, what are you going to do about the car?” I said,
                    “Well we have got the car. I can't get rid of it, Mr. Ambassador, but I will use
                    it to go to and from work. I will not use it as my predecessor did.” He said,
                    “You know, now that you are the head honcho, you have got to learn to step back,
                    take your hands off the operation and direct it rather than run it personally.”
                    It was a good lesson. How to learn to run an operation. Once I became head, the
                    two things which I was most intimately and directly involved were the arms
                    control talks, the START talks, the INF talks, and the Tokyo round of the trade
                    talks. Those were extraordinarily significant, and it required personnel
                    developing a good relationship with several members of each delegation, and
                    importantly, getting the heads of the delegations to trust me. Very critical,
                    and particularly on the arms talks, there was a lot of media around. We had
                    maybe 15 or 20 people around each week coming in from out of town to try to deal
                    with these issues. And it was up to me to judge the people. If I recommended
                    that an ambassador do an interview, they would do it. If not, they wouldn't. But
                    I had to be very careful, because if any of the people whom I recommended broke
                    our agreement, I would have had my head handed to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say broke the agreement, what was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well, the conditions of our interview, by naming the person with whom
                    they were speaking or by not writing the thing up properly. So this became very
                    sensitive. I had to be involved in the negotiations, where things are going.
                    this is when we were going to station INF missiles in Germany. This is when
                    Willy Brandt took a toy airplane and threw it at one of his opponents in the
                    Bundestag. We were using our Worldnet operation to reach other countries in
                    Europe and convince them to allow the stationing of U.S. missiles on their
                    territory. A very sensitive area. Then the START talks, which were much wider
                    ranged and were headed by a guy named Rowny.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, General Ed Rowny.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>WILSON: The missile talks were headed by Paul Nitze. The START talks were less
                    imminent so they were less emphasis on this, but Rowny became jealous of Nitze.
                    He was getting all the press attention. So Rowny wanted some press attention.
                    But then the relationship between Rowny and Nitze deteriorated markedly. For
                    example, and this is fact, both arms control ambassadors periodically went to
                    Brussels to brief the NATO allies. They would fly in a military plane. Nitze was
                    always very precise and very on time. Rowny knew that being late was anathema to
                    Nitze. Nitze hated that. So most of the time when they flew up together, Rowny
                    either deliberately or because of his nature would always end up at the airport
                    late, and the plane had to wait for him. This would drive Nitze crazy. It would
                    drive him absolutely up the walls. One of the more interesting times I had with
                    them, and I was much closer to Nitze and the intermediate nuclear force, the INF
                    delegation than I was to the START talks. Our ambassador to the INF talks, Paul
                    Nitze, and the Soviet ambassador, Kvitsinsky, decided to talk a walk in the
                    woods because I think each of them felt they really couldn't trust their own
                    people, who may be bugging their conversations, so they decided to go for a walk
                    in the woods, literally. When they came back from that walk in the woods, they
                    had reached an agreement as to how we could conclude the INF talks. They really
                    had. This was then sent back to Washington by Ambassador Nitze. I don't know how
                    the Soviet side worked, but you have to remember on the U.S. side, it was a
                    conglomeration of interests. You had the Arms Control Agency, in which Nitze
                    worked. You had the White House; you had the NSC; you had the joint chiefs, and
                    they all had their own lines of communication. Everything went back with their
                    own spin on it. This is, of course, what Nitze wanted to avoid. He wanted to get
                    his stuff back first. The initial reaction by a guy named Allen who was National
                    Security Advisor to President Reagan was extremely positive. Hey, this is really
                    a good basis for concluding agreements. What no one realized, this was in
                    August, was that a little man over in the Pentagon, a political appointee named
                    Richard Perle, was on vacation. He had been on vacation in France. When he came
                    back the position in Washington changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was known as the prince of darkness. He hated the
                        Soviet Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>WILSON: Correct. So Richard Perle is on vacation in France. He likes to cook and
                    eat. He came back and he saw this agreement. Then some of the defense
                    contractors got to him, and after about six or seven weeks, the agreement was
                    scuttled. We wanted to say the Soviets scuttled it, but in fact we really did.
                    But this really opened up a whole area for responsible journalists, what the
                    hell is going on. This is where I earned my money, because I was able to give a
                    few journalists, these were with one exception, someone form the BBC, I took
                    them out and showed them where the walk took place. I got them deep background
                    briefings with Ambassador Nitze. They helped get our position our, at least the
                    position Nitze had negotiated. Now ultimately that particular walk in the woods
                    agreement was rejected, and in talking to Ambassador Nitze a year or so later,
                    he said that he had made a big mistake. I said, “What was that, Mr. Ambassador?”
                    He said, “Well I should have realized that the agreement eliminated an entire
                    class of weapons.” Which is ultimately what happened. He said, “What I did not
                    realize is that by eliminating an entire class of weapons, instead of saying
                    reducing this to about 100 or so, I got all the defense contractors and the
                    sub-contractors against the agreement. If I had left in 100 or so weapons, they
                    would have been happy. It probably would have gone through.” This is speculation
                    after the fact, but it was a very interesting point because ultimately about
                    four years later, the agreement was put into place almost as it was negotiated
                    five years earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: David, you were...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We were talking about getting briefings, reporters briefings on this walk
                    in the woods. We had to be very careful on whom we got the briefing for, because
                    we recommended it. If I recommended it, Ambassador Nitze would do it. And
                    fortunately, just by good luck, no one ever crossed us up. I was very pleased
                    about that. You always put your neck on the line when you do those things. This
                    worked very well. Now the other thing that developed during all the arms talks,
                    was that I would often bring both to Ambassador Nitze and Ambassador Ryan, bring
                    in the BBC correspondent in Geneva. Again it would be on background. But the BBC
                    correspondent was always very well informed as to what was going on, and I got
                    to know him. I said to him, “How do you keep up on all this?” He said, “Well, to
                    be very frank, I get a weekly briefing from the foreign office when I am back in
                    London.” I said, “Oh that is very interesting.” Then in my own mind I related
                    this back to VOA, Voice of America being very pristine, wanting to have nothing
                    to do with the State Department, with USIA saying we are an independent news
                    gathering organization. Now the BBC reputation worldwide is still very sterling.
                    VOA is much less so in spite of VOA's insistence they wanted no special
                    briefings, no special contact, just like everyone else. The BBC on the other
                    hand got weekly briefings from the foreign ministry on whatever subjects they
                    needed. They didn't violate the confidence, and they still were respected as an
                    objective international news source. A rather interesting little sidelight.</p>

                <p>WILSON: It was left unsaid. We presented what the U.S. position was, and we tried
                    to frame it is such a way that the responsibility for the breakdown of these
                    negotiations lay with the Soviets.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Never got together with the Soviet spokesperson. One of the people who we
                    were very close to in all of these talks was a reporter named Strobe Talbott who
                    was a good friend of Nitze's, extremely reliable. A couple of times when we
                    arranged for our delegation and the Soviet delegation to take a little trip down
                    Lake Geneva, I had to contact the Soviets, and we brought Strobe along. Strobe
                    never broke a confidence. He was very good about that. He knew the subject. He
                    covered the Soviet Union, covered Russia. He was very good, a very reliable
                    person. I think he did some writing well after the fact.</p>

                <p>WILSON: The people who were based in Geneva for various news gathering
                    organizations around the world were very knowledgeable in the details of
                    whatever is going on. They would normally report back on a regular basis. The
                    stuff they would report back on would not garner headlines. It was just stuff
                    that would fill the back pages. Whenever a major conference was taking place,
                    these same organizations would send in “their big guns form home base.” That was
                    always a slight problem for the locals who felt ignored or shut out. It was a
                    problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would they get the stories wrong too, the big guns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No, not if they checked with their local guys as to what the background
                    was. They didn't care about the details. The cared about the global impression,
                    the big picture. They wouldn't get the stories wrong. They wouldn't necessarily
                    have all the subtle details and the nuances. The local guys did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought particularly in some of these
                        disarmament conferences, it would be very difficult to deal. You know, I
                        mean we are talking about almost points of theology practically. How much
                        throw weight, how much this, that, and things moved at a glacial pace
                        anyway. Wasn't it hard not to say, well you heard my briefing last week, and
                        it is the same this week or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>WILSON: No, because they wouldn't report on a daily basis. They would report when
                    something was happening. You know, the big thing with the arms talks, the arms
                    control talks. Then you had the Committee on the Conference on Disarmament, CCD
                    or the CD. There was the question about maneuvering. What do you do about the
                    Chinese? How do you deal with this little issue or that little issue? That would
                    be for a period of maybe six or eight weeks once a year. Then they would go away
                    and they would come back and take up where they left off on the arms control
                    side. The other side of the real interesting press work or media work was the
                    trade talks. Most of the reporters did not want to get involved in the trade
                    issue. Obviously the guy from the Wall Street Journal did. There were people
                    from the New York Times that did, but the New York Times when they really got
                    going would send in, they had a permanent person, but when they really got
                    interested in something they would send in someone who really knew the subject
                    to give a little more global perspective. The trade talks were very important,
                    the Tokyo round trade talks. I learned more than I ever, I didn't know much
                    about it to begin with, but I learned very quickly. It is my background in these
                    trade talks for about three years that ultimately got me the PAO job at the U.S.
                    mission to the European Community in Brussels, because I knew the players, and I
                    knew the issues. So the trade talks were very significant, though people didn't
                    pay much attention to them because a lot of special interests were involved,
                    cocoa interests, lumber interests. Our delegation was always filled with people
                    from the various special interest groups. The trade talks became more over a
                    period of time, much more significant to what we were doing than even the
                    nuclear talks, except the nuclear talks could save us from being killed, and
                    trade talks save us from going broke.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the other delegations? Particularly, I think of
                        the French, and maybe the Germans, particularly, when you get into trade
                        talks. The French pursue their interest much more than anyone else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Sure, but you mention two countries that happened to be members of the
                    European Community at the time, and the European Community had a delegation in
                    Geneva. Whenever they dealt with trade issues, it was the European Community
                    spokesman, or the European Community position that was critical. Now the French
                    and the Germans obviously made their issues known within the European Community,
                    and they helped shape the European Community position, but their role in the
                    actual negotiation was less significant as individual countries because of the
                    European Community and the European Union then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would have thought particularly at that period,
                        France was sort of the major driving force in the European Union, Germany
                        happily letting France take the lead, but basically was fine but basically a
                        protectionist thrust, correct me if I am wrong, in agriculture and
                        culture.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Agriculture was very significant for the French. Culture was not really
                    an issue in the talks as such, except when it came in to motion pictures, and
                    then it became...</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say motion pictures.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Television became a significant issue. Agriculture is still a major
                    issue. Nothing has been solved in that. The U.S. position in all this is not
                    always that clear. Fortunately the U.S. delegation was always headed by someone
                    from the U.S. Trade Representative's office. While that is a bureaucracy, it is
                    a very small bureaucracy, less than 200 people. You could deal with them very
                    well. It was in this sense that you could see how over the years the State
                    Department's position on economic affairs had become eroded. State had
                    absolutely no, I mean they had a member as part of the delegation, but they
                    weren't significant in any way. Commerce was even more significant than State.
                    Agriculture was more significant than State. But USTR kept the whole thing going
                    and the whole thing together and they did an extraordinarily good job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you find, say when USTR came out, a deputy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: They have someone there permanently, a permanent ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you acted as spokesman for this group too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find these various delegations and I imagine
                        each one had again its own way of doing things and all this? I would think
                        that as you were running around you would be switching hats and outlooks,
                        methods of working all the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>WILSON: Well, it required learning a new culture, a new set of terms because I
                    really had not been steeped in trade. I did that. But, it is interesting that
                    you should mention that because that solved sort of a State Department personnel
                    dilemma. We had been asking, when I became PAO, to get a new deputy out. He was
                    kind of lazy, he is kind of lazy still. He is retired. I really wanted an
                    information officer, and I put in a request to handle some of these other talks.
                    The deputy wasn't doing diddly. I had forgotten about it, because I was told no,
                    there is no position available. Okay. Suddenly, I don't know the date exactly, I
                    got a call from Washington saying, you know, your request for an information
                    officer, we are going to fill it. I said, “No, kidding! That's great. Who is
                    coming out?” They said, I think she was an 0-1 at the time, maybe an 0-2. They
                    said, “Ruth van Heuven.” I said, “Who? Who is she?” They said, “Well, she is a
                    State officer, and she is in the consular section.” I said, “Oh, why is she
                    coming out to be my information officer?” They said, “Well, her husband is going
                    to be named DCM at the mission, and we need a place for Ruth to go. She can't
                    work for her husband in any way in the mission, so we thought she could work for
                    you and fill that slot.” I said, “Oh.” I had actually known Ruth on a personal
                    basis. Our kids had gone to the same nursery school, so I had known Ruth, and
                    she was a very fine officer, very opinionated, but all right. In any case, I
                    knew that the consular officer was leaving. “Why don't you assign her to the
                    consular section?” Because the consular section in Geneva was attached not to
                    Geneva but to the embassy in Bern. The embassy in Bern was responsible for the
                    consular activities in the whole country. I knew that the slot was vacant. They
                    were hemming and hawing, and they said, “Well, we have already paneled a young
                    woman named Kay Dailey,” Kate Dailey, Kay Dailey, whatever her first name was,
                    “so she is getting that job.” I said, “Well why can't you unpanel her and give
                    the job to Ruth?” They said, “She is a very feisty young Irish girl, and she
                    said she will take us to court if we try that. We are going to leave that one
                    alone. Since there is this opening that you have requested, and USIA has not
                    given us a slot, we are going to fill in with Ruth.” Ruth came. She knew a lot
                    of the people on the arms control side because her husband had been dealing with
                    a lot of them in the State Department. She didn't like the trade talks so I let
                    her do some of the arms control. She loved it. She was very efficient, and she
                    got along very well with the ambassador who at that point a guy named Jeff
                    Swaebe. So it worked out very well until, and Ruth and I always got along well,
                    until it came time for the efficiency rating period, the old ER period. Ruth
                    came to me and she said, “I don't want your deputy to write the efficiency
                    rating on me. I want you to write it on me, and I want the ambassador to review
                    it.” I could understand why she didn't want my deputy to write it because, I
                    mean they just did not get along, understandably from her perspective. So I
                    said, “Sure, Ruth, I'll be glad to do it.” I did it and it was within her
                    prerogative as a State officer to have the ambassador do the review, fine. So I
                    took it up to him, and he also wanted me to write his review. I did that for him
                    and sent them both up to him in draft. He called me up, I remember it was a
                    Friday afternoon. He said, “This is ridiculous.” I said, “What do you mean, Mr.
                    Ambassador?” He said, “What you have written for Ruth, for you rating and what
                    you have written for my rating is absolutely wrong. It is ridiculous. No one is
                    that good. You cannot write stuff like this. This is the problem with the State
                    Department. You guys are always patting each other on the back and never saying
                    the bad things. This is crazy. I come from business. I know how things are
                    done.” He said, “I want you to take this back, and I want you to think about it
                    over the weekend. I want to talk to you on Monday. I want you to remember I
                    write a review of your performance too. Just remember that.” Well I took it
                    back, and I thought about it. On Monday afternoon I went up and talked to the
                    ambassador. He said, “Well did you think it over?” I said, “Yes, I did.” He
                    said, “What is your response?” I said, “Mr. Ambassador, do you think Ruth van
                    Heuven is doing a good job?” He said, “She is doing an excellent job.” I said,
                    “Mr. Ambassador, do you want Ruth van Heuven to get promoted?” He said, “Yes, I
                    do.” I said, “Mr. Ambassador, the rating and your review stands as I have
                    written it. If your answer to those questions are yes, that's the way it has got
                    to go.” I left. In the end he took my rating, my writing, he took his review
                    that I had written, and made it even more glowing, because he liked Ruth, and
                    indeed she got promoted. It was a harrowing 48 or 72 hours, because obviously I
                    knew she wasn't as good as you are writing, but if you want to get someone
                    promoted, you have to.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. So, was there any particular incident or occasion
                        that caused great crisis or trouble while you were there that sticks in your
                        mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No, not in the outside work, nothing that would have shaken the world.
                    There were obviously inside things. When Ambassador Swaebe left and Ambassador
                    Carmen came in, Ambassador Carmen did not get along with van Heuven. Ambassador
                    Carmen did not like the way Martin van Heuven parted his hair. I am serious. He
                    didn't like Martin walking around with a superior attitude. The Ambassador had
                    decreed that none of his staff should do representation unless they checked with
                    him first. This is all right; it is getting into a little everybody's knickers,
                    but you don't usually do that. In any case, Martin van Heuven was a big Yale
                    person. It happened that the Yale Whiffenpoofs were coming out. Martin had
                    arranged to do a reception for them. They were coming through Europe. He failed
                    to check this with the ambassador. There were problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself playing the role...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Oh sure in the middle of this, absolutely. Particularly since Martin's
                    wife worked for me, I mean it was a very interesting party. I learned to be an
                    internal diplomat very quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I often said in the Foreign Service that real diplomacy is
                        done in the Department or inter-departments within the U.S. government. The
                        outside diplomacy you know where people stand, and you really don't have
                        that much maneuvering room, but...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. But I had known Martin from back here, and I had known
                    Ruth, and the ambassador liked me. I was literally in the middle. I think I
                    helped out, although Martin didn't get the representation money for his
                    Whiffenpoofs. At least he wasn't kicked out immediately. But the other thing was
                    when they were, Ambassador Swaebe when he picked Martin van Heuven, the DCM slot
                    was open, he was sent five files from the Department for potential DCM's. We sat
                    up in the bubble and we discussed them. The senior State Department guy was
                    there and was telling the ambassador about this one or that one. The ambassador
                    finally with a big smile on his face, this was in the bubble said, “Now come on
                    Jack, I have read all this. You can't distinguish between them. Everyone is
                    great. You cannot tell me that one is better than the other. The only way you
                    could really make a distinction here is from corridor reputation. I don't want
                    your goddamn fake pile of bullshit. I want to know who is good and who is not
                    good from corridor reputation.” He was right; he was absolutely correct. Jack
                    hemmed and hawed and he ended up with Martin.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what Worldnet was or is?</hi>

                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>WILSON: It was then an experimental international television service conceived by
                    then USIA director Charles Wick to broadcast views of senior U.S. government
                    officials, put those views up on satellite, interview them, and make these
                    available to opinion makers in some of the critical countries. It particularly
                    involved the arms control talks. Geneva was involved because we were there, and
                    the first Worldnet posts were France, Germany, Netherlands, England, then we and
                    then Italy. These were all critical allies in the IMF talks in particular, and
                    we wanted to bring the allies along. We would have interviews with heads of the
                    arms control agency, with National Security Advisor presenting the U.S.
                    position. So I was in the first round of Worldnet programs when I was overseas.
                    I learned quickly that this was a Charlie Wick special because other posts had
                    done it a couple of weeks before I did because they had trouble hooking up our
                    equipment. I finally had my first one. One of the things that you were required
                    to do was to write an assessment of the thing instantly, not a day or two later,
                    but instantly. So, being naive, I wrote an assessment of the first one we had
                    done. I forgot who the participant was, but we had journalists there and they
                    asked questions. One of the things I said was that it was way too long. It went
                    on for an hour; it would be much better if it were shorter. Now fortunately
                    before I sent this, this was a telegram before E-mail stuff. Before I sent the
                    telegram, I showed it to Ambassador Swaebe who agreed with me totally. Fine.
                    About 6:30 at night I got a phone call from Washington. They asked who I was and
                    I told them. The said, “Oh good, Director Wick wants to speak with you.” I said,
                    “He wants to speak with me?” He got on the phone. He had seen the cable because
                    we had a direct to Wick so he would see the cable. He said, “What the hell do
                    you mean by saying it is too long? You are saying that my concept is not a good
                    concept?” I said, “Well Mr. Wick, I thought it was a very good concept, but it
                    dragged on too long, and questions were becoming repetitive. It would be much
                    crisper if it were shorter.” He said, “That's bullshit.” He used that word. I
                    said, “Why don't you give Ambassador Swaebe,” they were good friends, “a call. I
                    cleared this cable with Ambassador Swaebe, and he agrees with it.” That calmed
                    him, “He agrees with it?” I said, “Yes, he agrees. Why don't you give him a
                    call.” In any case, I guess Wick liked my honesty, because in early December I
                    was on vacation in Rome for Christmas. I got a call. I thought this was another
                    call from Wick. I thought this was my friends putting it over on me because you
                    had to leave your name and number where you are going to be, etc. I got a call
                    back, “Mr. Wick is on his way to the White House to spend Christmas Eve with
                    President Reagan as he does all the time. He will call you. Stay where you are.”
                    So I did. He said, “I want you to come back and be the first program director of
                    Worldnet.” I said, “Thank you very much. Let me think about it over the
                    Christmas period, and I will contact your office right after New Years and we
                    will talk about it.” He said, “Young man, when I offer you a job, it's yours.” I
                    said, “Oh, okay, fine.” “We will talk about it right after Christmas. That's
                    fine.”</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>Meanwhile, the area director for USIA for Europe, he was a bullshitter, but he
                    had gotten very far in the agency because he was such a bullshitter. I liked
                    him, a guy named Sam Courtney, called and said he wanted me to become the deputy
                    director of VOA Europe. VOA was setting up a new broadcasting arm, setting it up
                    in Munich. I had helped the guy who was going to be heading it up, a guy named
                    Mike Scott. I had helped him with VOA stations around Geneva, in France, Italy.
                    I helped him get these stations pick up VOA. Frank was in on Geneva and he knew
                    he wanted me to become his deputy in Munich. Okay, my wife wasn't certain she
                    wanted to move to Germany, but that's okay. So I called the area director after
                    Mr. Wick made me this offer that I really couldn't refuse. I kind of played a
                    dirty trick on him. I said, “I understand you want me to become the deputy
                    director of VOA Europe in Munich.” He said, “Yes.” He launched into this oration
                    about how important this job was and how they really needed me, someone of my
                    talents. I said, “I agree Stan. I got this funny phone call the other day from
                    Director Wick. He said he wants me to become the first program director of
                    Worldnet.” Without breaking stride this area director proceeded to tell me how
                    important it would be for the area for me to come back to the Worldnet job. He
                    didn't take a breath. He went right on about how the area would benefit from
                    this, how it was so European centric. How I knew all the issues and this would
                    really benefit the area. That's how things work in a bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>Then, Wick was visiting Paris, and he called me on a Saturday, and he said, “I
                    want you to be here on Sunday. I want to talk to you.” So I got up there
                    somehow, Sunday morning, and we met. It was something at the Embassy. Then we
                    all went out to lunch including Mrs. Wick. I suspect that it was preplanned. She
                    sort of came behind and sort of walked behind with me and said, “Charlie really
                    needs you. You have got to come back. You can't not come back.” I told her my
                    personal problems. We left it at that. Then I told you I said, in April he
                    wanted me to come back on a temporary basis, for NATO, which I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you were working on the Worldnet from when to
                        when about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>WILSON: Well, when I came back I was about, I did it in May and June of '84. Then
                    I left to go back to Geneva to check out. I came back in roughly late August,
                    early September of '84 to become the first program director. I left that job in
                    May of '85 to become the executive assistant to the new deputy director of USIA.
                    Part of the reason I left that job was, well, I believed in Worldnet. I was
                    doing a good job. The head of Television was a guy who was slime, and his deputy
                    head was slime. You couldn't trust them. I had a lot of trouble with that. I
                    believe if you are going to work with somebody, you have got to trust them. The
                    head of it never wanted to take responsibility, and he was encouraging director
                    Wick to go to such lengths that it was becoming a non-believable entity. By that
                    I mean they were claiming such an audience for Worldnet that at one point I had
                    to walk with Mr. Wick from the door of where television was to USIA. He couldn't
                    find his way I guess. I said to him, “Mr. Wick, If you keep using these
                    statistics, within three months more people will have seen Worldnet by your
                    statistics than exist in the world. You can't keep using these statistics.”
                    Anyway they were, he didn't stop, but it became a very difficult thing up on the
                    hill, it became difficult for the White House, the congress, the OMB to give
                    money for Worldnet. It was running into problems. The audience for Worldnet, you
                    had to sort of take it on faith. I will give you two examples.</p>
                <p>One day they were doing some Worldnets to Europe about 5:00 in the morning, 6:00
                    in the morning, because of the time difference. I wouldn't get into the office
                    until 8:30 or 9:00. One morning a young lady came to me and said, “ David we
                    have a problem.” I said, “What's the problem?” She said, “We had some space to
                    fill, and we just pulled a film or video off the shelf, we had some time to
                    fill. It was by a guy named Frederick Wiseman. It showed monkeys copulating. It
                    vividly showed monkeys copulating.” I said, “Holy Shit!” Well the first thing I
                    had to find out is what it was. I wanted to see it. I didn't want to run off
                    unless I know what I am talking about. Of course all the secretaries are
                    talking; they wanted to see what it was too. It wasn't that bad. Anyway the
                    decision is do we tell Mr. Wick. I said, “No, but I would tell the counselor and
                    let's see what happens.” There was no reaction. It was at that point going to
                    six or seven posts in Europe. That was it.</p>
                <p>Less than a week later, maybe four days later, this same lady came running in to
                    me again about the same topic. This time with sort of a smile on her face and
                    said, “Well we screwed up again.” I said, “What happened this time?” She said,
                    “Well we had a hole to fill and so we pulled something off the shelf from a
                    station in,” whatever, KAE something in Los Angeles, “and it showed the contras
                    killing women and children.” I said, “Oh my God!” Again I went through the same
                    procedure. You know, I knew what they were going to do with the regular program,
                    but they would just pull something off the shelf. Again, nobody called. Nobody
                    said anything.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>So it was still a small enough operation, and I knew the PAO's in the posts that
                    were getting Worldnet. I knew them personally. So, I decided from about 10:00 to
                    noon which is about 4:00 to 6:00 in Europe, I knew they would all be there, and
                    I just thought I would call them and sit down and chat with them. How are things
                    going, what's up. We chatted. Seen Worldnet, do you like it? Yes. I didn't
                    mention about any specifics. I did this with every single PAO. It was obvious
                    that nobody was watching, because even if they did they weren't upset enough to
                    call or write in or something. They would have mentioned it humorously. Nobody
                    was watching. Again they all said they were watching. Based on this, I called
                    the controller of the USIA, a guy named Stan Silverman who I know and like. I
                    said, “Stan,” and I explained the situation. I said, “Look, the next world net
                    will be early next week. I would like to make an offer to any PAO who calls you
                    or calls me, whoever you designate, within half an hour of the close of the
                    Worldnet. We will make this at the end of the Worldnet, gets an extra $1,000 in
                    his or her representation budget. I assure you Stan, no one is going to call.”
                    He said, “No, I can't take that chance. We haven't got the... I said, “Take it
                    out of the director's budget, but nobody is going to call, because nobody is
                    watching it.” He wouldn't let me do it. I didn't do it. But it was the case.
                    FSN's were maybe setting it up, they were looking at it, but no one had the
                    courage to say that hey they weren't watching it. They all dissembled to some
                    extent, at least early on. It was a problem early on.</p>
                <p>In the same regard, while I was still in Geneva, the PAO in London was on sick
                    leave at home, he had a heart condition. His information officer was doing
                    Worldnet. At some point they didn't have any questioners. They couldn't get any
                    newspaper guys in. The director, Mr. Wick, went ape. So then counselor called an
                    emergency meeting of all the Worldnet posts in London, and we had the riot act
                    read to us. If you do Worldnet, by God you have got to have questions. I went
                    back to Geneva and the first Worldnet that we had, we couldn't get a
                    correspondent to come. They had seen a couple, and it wasn't very interesting. I
                    finally got one guy who represented AP Dow Jones. Well, we were prohibited from
                    getting American correspondents or people representing American news outlets and
                    agencies. It came right down to the wire, so finally I said to Mike, a guy named
                    Mike Strauss. I said, “If it is any help AP Dow Jones is a foreign consortium
                    for dealing overseas just to avoid U.S. anti trust laws, and we are not an
                    American corporation. We are a European corporation. Great! Good, you could ask
                    questions. But you might know that one of my beloved colleagues in Germany as
                    soon as this went on called Washington and said, “Hey what the hell is this guy
                    Wilson doing in Geneva? They are putting on an American correspondent.” So when
                    it was over I got a phone call. I had to explain that while he was American in
                    origin, he was representing a foreign news gathering agency which was
                    incorporated in Europe and not an American news gathering agency. But I was
                    scared to death having seen what happened to the PAO in London, I could have my
                    head handed to me, by not having somebody. So I had to make a quick decision. So
                    we followed up with Worldnet from the Washington perspective, aside from the
                    monkeys copulating and the contras killing women and children.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>One of the positive things I learned from Mr. Wick in a negative way while I was
                    director of Worldnet was that in a bureaucracy, if you want to get something
                    done, find out who the individual is who is responsible. Because in a
                    bureaucracy some individual has to be responsible. The USIA had a foreign press
                    center in Los Angeles at the time. Mr. Wick discovered that they weren't pulling
                    down the Worldnet for whatever reason to show to foreign correspondents. You
                    couldn't show it to Americans, but you could show it to foreign correspondents.
                    He wanted to know why. He wanted to know who was responsible for not having that
                    set up in Los Angeles. I was told by the head of television, you find out. You
                    find out who is responsible and why they don't have it. So I rooted around and
                    found out. He wanted to blame the head of the foreign correspondent center in
                    Washington who is responsible for the one in New York and the one in Los Angeles
                    who was an African American who I had worked with and knew and liked and worked
                    with in Africa. Wick didn't particularly like him. It turned out that the reason
                    that we didn't have the program brought down to foreign correspondents in Los
                    Angeles was because the head of the Los Angeles foreign correspondent center was
                    a woman who was a sister of an ABC correspondent who Wick liked and hadn't
                    gotten off her duff to do very much. She didn't think it was worthwhile. So I
                    was faced with what do I tell Wick. No it wasn't this guy in Washington who you
                    don't like, but it was this sister of this woman in Los Angeles who you do like.
                    I told him straight out. That was the only way to deal with it. I found that in
                    the future that was the best way to deal with it, just lay it out. He may not
                    like what you are saying, but in the end he respected me for what I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have heard from people who dealt with Wick working for
                        USIA, one he was a little hard to get used to at first, but I have a great
                        deal of respect for the fact that, you know, he was able to get money, he
                        had ideas. But it was sometimes difficult dealing with him because he had an
                        extremely sort attention span. You had to come in with a chart with maybe
                        one or two lines on it. Did you find this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. His attention span was short. You couldn't ramble on. You had to
                    come in very succinctly with what you wanted to get done. A fairly amusing story
                    along these lines is that when he was making his presentation to the OMB for his
                    budget, the first year he did it or the second year he did it, he made a video
                    and had the people look at it. The second year it was supposed to be on
                    Saturday. It was supposed to be in the morning. The thing dragged on, never on
                    time. It was about five or six o'clock on Saturday afternoon. We made the video.
                    They said, “Well Mr. Wick,” It was David, this is the guy who got fired. A
                    former Congressman. Anyway, it will come to me, a good guy, smart guy. He said.
                    “Look we can take you now if you want or we can do it on Monday morning.” Wick
                    said, “Well let's do it now.” He said to his staff, “Just a minute.” He said,
                    “We will give you 15 minutes, Mr. Wick.” So they did. We all came into the room
                    to do this presentation, he handed out popcorn. He said, “I know you are going
                    to do a video, so I figured if we are going to go to the movies we might as well
                    have popcorn.” It worked. It was done very well, and Wick got his money. That
                    part did work very well.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>But the idea of personal responsibility in a bureaucracy I think is very
                    important. I do believe in it, whether it is State Department, Defense
                    Department, Agriculture, whatever. My own philosophy now in working with the
                    foreign affairs community, if someone says oh, I can't do it because of the
                    regulations, I say well the regulations are written by human beings. Who made
                    this particular regulation, and what is the purpose behind it? Often people will
                    hide behind the manual of operation and procedures and say we just can't do it
                    because, without a little thinking further. If you really want to accomplish
                    something in a bureaucracy, you have got to look behind the regulations. I think
                    that becomes very critical.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>I don't know if I mentioned it, but one of the problems we ran into when we
                    actually got to Brussels was a bureaucratic regulation from the State Department
                    which provided that for educational travel, you could go back up until age 22 or
                    23, whatever it said for college purposes or high school, was allowable once a
                    year. Fine. My older son came over to visit us. He wanted to go back because his
                    college was starting. They had a three week winter program for whatever reasons.
                    He had to do a winter study program. He had to be back at a certain time. I went
                    to get his ticket from the admin section, and was told he can't leave until four
                    or five days after he needed to be back. I said “Why?” They said it is because
                    of regulations. It has got to be 365 days and it's not. It has got to be a full
                    year. I was furious, but I couldn't do anything about it. My son went to the
                    people in Williams College. He was going to take a course like baseball
                    statistics. That was fine. He went to the head of the course and said, “You
                    know, I am not going to be here for the first two or three days of the class. If
                    that's okay.” “No,” the teacher said, “No. I front loaded the course and if you
                    aren't going to be here, you can't take the course.” Which meant that he was
                    getting off campus to go skiing or something for the next three weeks. That is
                    what it meant. My son was majoring in chemistry, and he got the chemistry
                    department to devise a winter studies program for him, and he did that. I then
                    talked to the State Department. I wasn't dealing with USIA, I was dealing with
                    State. They said, “Oh yes, these are the regulations. This is the way Congress
                    wants it.” Well it happens we get a lot of, in Brussels we had a lot of CODELs
                    (Congressional delegations) come through. I made a point of asking both staffers
                    and members of Congress in the 70's why was this regulation in place. Of course,
                    nobody had ever heard of it. Nobody cared; nobody knew, and they all said that
                    is ridiculous. So armed with this I went back to the Director General's office
                    in State and said, “Hey you can't tell me you have got this regulation in place
                    because Congress wants it. Congress doesn't want it. They don't care. They think
                    it is ridiculous. You can't run an academic program on the State Department
                    guidelines. You have got to have some flexibility because sometimes people have
                    got to go back earlier or later. The academic schedule does not run on either
                    the regular calendar or the State Department regulations.” I had a major battle
                    with the State Department. When I came back for some leave, I made a point of
                    going over there. The Deputy Director General said, “Look, you are absolutely
                    right. See if you can get USIA and others to go along with this because the
                    regulation is wrong. It should be changed.” They said, we agree with you and
                    here is what the new regulation is going to be. I said, “Well good. Let's put it
                    into effect.” They said, “No, we have to clear it,” I think it was 26 agencies.
                    I said, “Oh my God.” Ultimately, after a year and a half I got it changed. It
                    said about a year, but if a student needs to go back for academic reasons or
                    needs to go on a choir or sports activity, it could be less than a year. I got
                    that part of it changed. But then it was not just State Department but Williams
                    College refused to give my son a diploma. They said, “You know, he didn't take
                    this winter studies program.” I said, “But he did.” He called me and was all
                    upset. He said, “What should I do?” I said, “What's the matter?” He told me.
                    What he had done, he hadn't gone to the registrar and told them he was taking
                    this chemistry program. It was his fault. He didn't do it, but they were going
                    to deny him graduation. I said, “That is absolutely insane.” I was prepared to
                    fly home if that were the case. Well, he finally got them to agree, the
                    committee on academic exceptions met and agreed that if he would pay a $50 fine,
                    that they would recognize the course he took. He did the work; he did a good
                    job, and the whole thing would be dropped, and he could get his diploma. He
                    said, “What should I do?” I said, “Pay it. I will send you the extra $50. Pay
                    it.” Which he did, but then, when it came to graduation week. This was the
                    little college up in New England.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I spent four years at the little college up in New
                        England, class of '50.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Where?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Williams.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: You're kidding!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I know where it is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well, I'll be damned. In any case the President had a little garden party
                    for the parents and the graduates in the presidential garden. I have forgotten
                    what his name is now. I braced him in his own garden. I said, “This is crazy.
                    This $50.” Of course he didn't know anything about it. He didn't know what I was
                    talking about. He said, contact so and so, which I did. All I wanted was the
                    return of the $50. Well, dammit, they were adamant. No, they were not going to
                    return the $50. By that time I was getting - I still get - as you obviously
                    know, they are extremely good in their relations. I get so much mail from them
                    now, even though it was a long time. They do a tremendous number of events. I
                    get invited to go on study tours. It was very good. In any case, they said, no
                    way are we going to refund the $50. Well, Whitney's advisor in chemistry was a
                    good friend of his. He had something to do with alumni relations. He wrote back
                    a letter saying what a wonderful student Whitney was and all this and how
                    fortunate Williams was to have him, etc. That still didn't satisfy me. So in
                    making a small contribution to the parent's scholarship fund, I rote a note
                    saying, I would like to send another $50 but I am a little bit ticked off. I
                    explained, just one page. Williams College has $50. I would like it very much if
                    you would get that $50 and put it in the parents scholarship fund. Within a
                    week, done. They actually got the money and put it in the parents scholarship
                    fund. I contribute every year now; I was very pleased. but even a pace like
                    Williams has its own little bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, God, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>WILSON: I mean it is a great place. I could never see why my son wanted to go
                    there because I grew up in Pittsfield which is 20 miles away. I wanted to get
                    away from it. But in retrospect it was a great place for him to go and he truly
                    loved it. He started out wanting to play hockey because he played hockey in
                    Canada, but it soon became apparent that he was not good enough to get on the
                    hockey team. So he got on the Rugby team which was a non officially recognized
                    sport because apparently several years earlier the rugby people had become
                    rowdy. They had torn up some things. It was a club sport rather than a college
                    sport. He enjoyed rugby very much. It was on the weekends. It was a great event
                    for him, and he still maintains contact with many of his Williams colleagues.
                    Anyway, what I am saying, you have to learn to deal with the bureaucracy in the
                    State Department or Williams College, and you can do it. You don't have to just
                    give up. An individual can and often does make a difference, and that's the
                    philosophy. If you want to succeed in the Foreign Service to the extent that I
                    succeeded, that has been my philosophy, to be honest, to be direct, not
                    aggressive but honestly direct, and persist in trying to get something done.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I went over to be executive assistant to the deputy director. I left
                    Worldnet.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To close off at this point when you left Worldnet how did

                <p>WILSON: They weren't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A good idea that didn't work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It was an excellent idea. It was working, it just took a longer time to
                    work. It wasn't going to be instantly. Part of the success is that Wick had good
                    contacts in the administration and he could get people to appear on the program.
                    It was working. I mean the idea is a good idea. It just was pushed to an
                    extreme. Regular programs overseas you just could not get people to come
                    regularly to watch. On an occasional basis if you got Secretary Schultz, if you
                    got somebody to talk about a particular subject that was relevant at the moment
                    in a given country, absolutely. It worked extremely well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were able to direct programs, let's say somebody
                        talking about the Persian Gulf, so you could have people talking in Qatar or

                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. Not while I was there, but ultimately when they expanded these
                    areas, you could do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would make, I mean that would pick off...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Sure, and they do that now. It would take another decade before you had
                    the capability in all these places to do that. The capability exists now. You
                    can direct a program into a given area, so the concept is good. You just
                    couldn't push it as fast as Wick wanted to push it, and you couldn't push it as
                    often as Wick wanted to push it. That was the problem, but it was good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is one of the problems of our process, a
                        gestation period for a lot of programs or doing things takes longer than the
                        person who might come up with the idea hopes, particularly if they are a
                        political appointee. They feel the clock ticking and they want to show
                        something done on their watch rather than to allow it to percolate for
                        awhile.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That is absolutely right, and ultimately it became a fairly successful
                    program and useful. Success meaning a post overseas can use this to achieve its
                    objectives at a given moment. Yes you can. But at the beginning, as one
                    colleague said, who later became a counselor in the agency, when he was PAO in
                    NATO, and I used to see his reports coming in saying how many people watched it.
                    I said, “Gee Stan how did you get so many people in to watch it.” He said, “Well
                    there was me, there was a couple of people from the political section, and then
                    the two guys that brought the pizza. They were there too.” You had to be
                    creative in how you used it. It is a useful tool, but not the way it was being
                    pushed. But I didn't mind Wick pushing it, so much as I didn't like working for
                    the head of television who was a liar. That was the problem, but it was a
                    problem of blaming someone else, never wanting to take the blame himself. I
                    couldn't stand that.</p>

                        did in 1985.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I moved from the television service where I was program director of
                    Worldnet to become the executive assistant to the newly minted deputy director
                    of USIA, Marvin Stone. Marvin Stone had been previously the editor in chief of
                    U.S. News and World Report. He was a moderate Republican with a considerable
                    number of “democratic” views. He was acceptable to the director, Charlie Wick.
                    As I said before, Mr. Wick really wasn't political. Marvin Stone knew
                    Washington. He knew a lot of people, and he knew how to get around and get
                    things done.</p>

                <p>WILSON: He was an outsider, but he was very well organized. He kept maybe eight
                    or ten files on his desk that he was working on, that he would open up and deal
                    with it. He used to get a kick out of some of the Foreign Service jargon, the
                    lingo. He would tease us about it. The word “Tranche” for example, Foreign
                    Service Officers tend to use that a lot. He would make fun of it. He also was
                    very strict on some of the words that would come up to him on a memo. He said
                    when he was editor of the magazine, there were certain words that he would not
                    allow in, such as “upcoming.” You could not put that in. If it came up and I saw
                    it, and I put it through, I caught hell. But he had his peculiarities along
                    those lines. He was a very compassionate person. He trusted people until he
                    found that they couldn't be trusted, and then he would deal accordingly with
                    them. He had very specific time frames. He liked to go home at 5:30 or 6:00. He
                    wasn't one of these people who was given to staying all night to get the job
                    done. If he gave you a task, he assumed it would be done and done properly. He
                    didn't look over your shoulder. As the executive assistant, I tended to get some
                    of the, much of the, dirty work that he didn't want to deal with, personnel
                    problems, discipline problems, writing OER problems, this kind of thing. I did
                    OER's on all of the area directors and the heads of the various media and
                    cultural elements. That all came to me to do. We had a problem with a person who
                    was the deputy in the bureau of educational and cultural affairs. Now it is
                    being called ECA in the new State Department. This guy was a decent fellow, but
                    he tended to have a very deep voice, a very loud voice, and he shouted. Sure as
                    hell, I could tell he particularly shouted at women. Maybe two or three times a
                    month one of his staff, usually female, would come into my office and cry. I
                    could almost time it just like the Secret Service was timing how long it took
                    the President to get there after Monica Lewinski ended up in the West Wing, how
                    long it would take for this guy to come into my office, close the door, pound on
                    the desk, “It was not so.” I would let him pound, let him talk. He would calm
                    down, life went on. I learned to be a good listener to both sides. We did some
                    interesting things. One of the more interesting things was trying to get rid of
                    the responsibility for international fairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: International fairs being what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Fairs, you know, like you have the world Expo '68.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh I thought it was affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>WILSON: Affairs you wouldn't want to get rid of. Stimulating, some. But I am
                    talking about world fairs and world expos and things of this type. For some
                    reason it had fallen to USIA to be the operating agency in this. These brought
                    together State Department and Commerce in particular. Commerce should really
                    have been handling it, but by some act of Congress it was designated as a USIA
                    function. USIA never really had the money to do this. We tried and tried to get
                    out from underneath it. Some people in USIA liked doing this, so if they said we
                    were going to stop, they didn't mean it. They continued to do it until problems
                    arose. Usually, these events were headed by political appointees, regardless of
                    party. It depended on who was in power. They found that even though it was
                    promised that USIA would get out of it and Commerce would get into it, State
                    just took a non-committal seat. State should have taken the lead because State
                    should have, and the director of foreign affairs projects, who was in State,
                    just sat back and did nothing. You had problems with the heads of these
                    organizations in these events bringing in their political friends, bringing in
                    their relatives. There were a few scandals that went on with it. I don't know
                    who does it now. State has to because it is part of State whether they like it
                    or not. I would hope that State would have the courage to say hey, this is a
                    Department of Commerce affair, not a State Department affair. That is one of the
                    things I dealt with over a period of three years in USIA, trying to get it out
                    of USIA. I was grossly unsuccessful in attempting to do that.</p>
                <p>Another very interesting area was the area of broadcasting, the Voice of America,
                    and particularly Cuban broadcasting. As you know, under the Voice of America,
                    nominally under the Voice of America there was established in the early 80's a
                    broadcast outfit known as Radio Marti. Marti being a Cuban patriot, etc. This is
                    designed to broadcast into Cuba to let the Cuban people know about what freedom
                    was and how Castro was keeping things from them, etc. Castro tried to block it.
                    He wasn't very successful. What he did succeed in blocking was some of the more
                    powerful midwest and southern radio channels, the radio station channels in
                    their assigned areas. This of course, led the government to reimburse these
                    stations handsomely. Even when Castro stopped jamming, the government kept
                    reimbursing. That's okay.</p>
                <p>In any case, at that point the founder and head of the Cuban American Foundation
                    was a man named Jorge Mas Canosa. He was very powerful, particularly among
                    people in Florida and New Jersey. Both parties courted him. He tended to lean
                    more towards the Republican guy than not. He was a pain. He would call the
                    director of USIA, Charlie Wick and say he wanted us to do this, that, and the
                    other thing. Mr. Wick would turn it over to my boss, Marvin Stone, and Marvin
                    would in turn, turn it over to me to deal with, with Jorge.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>Part of the broadcasting to Cuba act provided that after the first 18 months, 24
                    months, whatever it was, a study had to be done and a survey to see how
                    effective it was or how effective it wasn't. This study had to be submitted to
                    Congress. Fair enough. It happens all the time. How can I put it. Mr. Stone was
                    put in charge of the government survey, and gave it to me. I in turn gave it to
                    the head of the research and evaluation staff, who was a political appointee.
                    That was fine. He kept me informed as to what he was doing. He hired a
                    researcher in the area. People did the research. The report came back in draft.
                    It was a very balanced and honest report. It praised many of the things that
                    Radio Marti was doing. It talked about the difficulty of getting through. It
                    talked about a few of the negatives. Balanced, a good report. I liked it; Mr.
                    Stone liked it. The draft went to Jorge Mas. He was up in the air. He said, “You
                    can't send this to Congress.” He ranted and raved enough I had to hold the
                    telephone away from my ear. Very unhappy. Of course, if he was unhappy, Mr.
                    Stone passed this along to Mr. Wick who didn't want him to be too unhappy
                    because that could go to some of the higher ups in the administration. What to
                    do? Well, I counseled my boss that you can't bury this report because the
                    opponents of Radio Marti obviously know about its existence, know about it being
                    done. If you bury it and don't send it forward, it is going to cause all kinds
                    of hell in Washington. At least for a couple of days in any case, it would be a
                    good media story. You know, administration buries negative report on Radio
                    Marti. I then came up with an idea, and it was accepted. My idea was let's do a
                    second report, and we will talk to the people that are going to do the report.
                    Meanwhile, don't bury this first report, send it to the Hill as we are required
                    by law, but send it a day or two before the Easter recess. What I said was
                    bought. The report was sent. Nothing more was ever heard. We sent it exactly to
                    the people we were supposed to send it to. Nobody said anything. Nobody said,
                    “Boo.” We didn't kill it; we didn't bury it.</p>
                <p>We then set out to commission someone else to do a report, someone who is, I
                    shouldn't say this on tape, but why the hell not? Someone who is more favorably
                    disposed to Jorge Mas Canosa, and someone of whom he approved in advance. Very
                    important. We had several different people, and we came up with one. Very
                    impressive credentials. He was from New York. He had a Ph.D. from this
                    university and MA from that university, etc. I worked this out with the head of
                    research. I was about to sign the contract for him when I got an anonymous phone
                    call. I usually don't pay attention to anonymous phone calls. I figure if it is
                    worthwhile saying, then someone is going to identify themselves. This was an
                    anonymous phone call from someone at the Voice of America, because the
                    particular person had done some work for the Voice of America. The essence of
                    the call was take a look at this gentleman's r�sum� and check out the facts that
                    he put down. Check out the universities he claims he has degrees from BA's to
                    doctorates. Check this out; check that out. So I did. I don't know why I did,
                    but I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you almost have to in that sort of situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>WILSON: It turned out that three of the universities he listed from which he said
                    he got degrees had never heard of him. The fourth university didn't exist. There
                    were other problems with his veracity. So I sat down with the head of research,
                    and I sat down with Mr. Stone, and we had to decide what to do. The decision was
                    that I should deal with it, and if necessary I would tell him that we were no
                    longer going to award him the contract and tell him why. I called him. He was in
                    New York. I said, “You know we have been doing a little bit of checking.” He
                    said, “I understand. I withdraw my name.” I didn't have to say anything further.
                    He made what could have been a very delicate situation much more palatable. But
                    it was very interesting, because what he was doing is not an unusual occurrence.
                    Apparently people are forging degrees and claiming degrees in things they
                    haven't done on r�sum�s. It is fairly common.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It keeps turning up on people, you know, on people who
                        apply in places you would suspect, assume that some checking had been
                        done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. Isn't that the case. In any case, we got someone else to do the new
                    study. It turned out glowing. Radio Marti was God's given instrument. Mr. Jorge
                    Mas was happy. Everyone else was happy. That was it. So we had two reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have a long set of interviews with Kenneth Skoug. I
                        don't know if you ever ran across him, but he was very much involved talking
                        about the politics of Radio Marti and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. And before I left they were talking about Television Marti. Well,
                    first of all, Radio Marti gets through. It gets through particularly in the
                    rather urban areas, it gets through on the beaches, etc. TV Marti doesn't get
                    through at all. I don't know if the budget for TV Marti was part of the USIA
                    budget. I don't know if it is still part of USIA budget not. But it is a false
                    budget because I think it was somewhere between 20 and 30 million, I don't know
                    it, went up and down. That didn't include the cost of the balloon to keep the
                    transmitter going around. That cost was buried in the Defense Department budget
                    somewhere around 40 million dollars. But whatever connected the two, it was up
                    there. But regardless of the cost, it is just not getting through. There is no
                    question about it. Now with Jorge Mas Canosa no longer with us, with the Cuban
                    American Foundation being less powerful than it was, you don't know what is
                    going to happen, but it was obvious that people in the Cuban American population
                    were looking for the time when Castro would be overthrown, die, and they could
                    then go back into Cuba and run the country. That has been their...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the refugee groups, they all think it will happen,
                        and time has gone by and whatever they had is not going to come back. There
                        is usually a good solid time lapse. I mean these people are thinking in 1950
                        terms.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>WILSON: Well this is the problem that the Voice of America faces in particular
                    with its refugees from eastern Europe who are doing broadcasting into the then
                    Soviet Union, now the former Soviet Union and countries of eastern Europe, or
                    other countries for that matter, Iran, it doesn't matter where. They have
                    perhaps different points of view from the U.S. government. The broadcasts have
                    to be monitored very carefully. Not apropos that, but I have a friend who had
                    been the head of the, I had gone to college with him. He was originally Laotian.
                    He came into the USIA as a Laotian radio broadcaster. He became the head of the
                    Laotian service. During the '60 election campaign, the policy was you could not
                    talk about a cease fire. You could talk about a step down. So one day I said to
                    him, “Taman, how do you do this?” He said, “There is no such thing as step-down
                    in Lao. We call it a cease fire.” I said, “Well that goes against policy.” He
                    said, “But who with a policy background has enough Lao to know what I am
                    saying?” He got us. And this goes on for all the languages, all the language
                    services. You have to keep fairly close tabs on them every once in awhile.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>Many of my problems with the Voice of America while I was working for the deputy
                    director lay in the personnel area. We had another guy who was doing one of the
                    Soviet language services. His name was Nodar Gingi Hasvili. He was from Georgia,
                    Soviet Georgia. He was having a lot of problems with some of his patriots in the
                    service and with some of the Americans. He accused them all of anti-Semitism.
                    This was a major issue. So, we did not want this to get out of hand, and so Mr.
                    Stone and I convened a hearing. We had the American there who he was accusing
                    and some of his other colleagues there. He was there. This lasted almost a week,
                    a long time. We took this extremely seriously. We did not in the end find any
                    evidence of anti-Semitism. It may have been under the surface; it may have been
                    individuals; but we did not find that Mr. Gingi Hasvili was having troubles
                    because he was Jewish. It did not seem to be the case. There were some pretty
                    high powered officials, and some of those people we were dealing with are now
                    even more high powered in the success of radio stations. What can I say?
                    Meanwhile, Mr. Gingi Hasvili is in London working for the BBC. One of the things
                    that I tried to do was to get him a job here in Washington, to get him out of
                    Voice. I went to a lot of different places including the CIA to see if we could
                    get him a job doing translations or, basically, translations of Soviet language.
                    He spoke several of the languages in the Soviet Union. He was a professor. We
                    could not really get him, we got him one job for a short period. But it was very
                    interesting in dealing with him, because I must have dealt with him, his name
                    was Nodar, I must have dealt with Nodar at least once a week. He'd come in and
                    talk. I'd listen. He felt better about it. We got him a job in our research
                    office in USIA. We got him some kind of a job in INR in stages for a temporary
                    job. But basically it was a very interesting phenomenon because he was brought
                    up on communism. He said, “You know, I left a good position,” in whatever
                    university he was in. He said, “I had a car. I had a nice apartment. I had a
                    dacha in the country. They provided for me. Over here I have nothing.” He was
                    almost longing for the good old days of communism providing. It was quite
                    remarkable. He was an intelligent person. I mean extremely intelligent. I know
                    he was still following up because later when I was in Brussels, I got a call
                    from a lawyer. He wanted me to do a deposition on the situation with Nodar, etc.
                    I haven't heard further from them, but I am still sure that he is trying to
                    redeem himself in some way in the United States. I don't know. But those were
                    the kinds of issues we dealt with. The anti-Semitism was a particularly
                    sensitive issue because his wasn't the only case. There were a couple of others.
                    It was always dealing with eastern Europe. It never could be proved directly,
                    but one suspects individual cases, there was beneath the surface a problem.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problem in USIA in your time there
                        because you were finding yourself sort of stuck with a lot of personnel
                        things, sort of the policy level agenda or race? Did you, I mean, was this
                        any particular issue or how...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No. Race never played a role in my view. I never recall a case. Gender,
                    no. I think I told you when I was on the Board of Examiners for a period, the
                    head of our equal employment opportunities kept wondering if a certain African
                    American had passed the exam. I kept telling him they haven't taken the exam
                    yet. How can they pass it? “Well you know what I mean. Are they going to pass?”
                    “I guess they will but I don't know. We have got to interview them first.” While
                    I was in the deputy director's office I was not confronted with any racial
                    problems, any that made an impression on me that I can remember. This was during
                    the period when President Reagan met with Soviet Prime Minister Brezhnev in
                    Geneva. No it was Gorbachev, sorry. We had the situation where Mr. Wick went
                    over and a USIA officer, the PAO in Geneva was assigned the task of just taking
                    care of Mr. Wick. Other people were assigned other things to take care of
                    President Reagan, but the PAO was assigned to take care of Mr. Wick. That's the
                    way things go. But when they got back, there was a decision to be made as to who
                    and how, who was going to implement, State or USIA or both, how are they going
                    to implement the decision that Mr. Reagan made at the summit in Geneva. There
                    was a major conflict between State and USIA as to what should be done. It was
                    major, major. Mr. Wick said that he knew what was to be done, and the deputy
                    assistant secretary for the area, a man named Mark Palmer who later became
                    ambassador to Hungary, said he knew what was going to be done because he was
                    over there too. Nothing happened for awhile. A big discussion as to who was
                    going to do what. Well, one day my boss, Mr. Stone, said, “Come on in. Charlie,”
                    Charlie Wick, “Charlie wants us in his office.” We all went in, and the
                    counselor for the agency was there, and Mr. Wick's secretary was there. Mr. Wick
                    said, “Get Mark Palmer on the phone.” He got Mr. Palmer, Secretary Palmer on the
                    phone, put him on the speaker phone. There were the usual pleasantries, but they
                    weren't so pleasant. They went through it again, the litany. Mark Palmer said,
                    “Mr. Wick, I know exactly what the president wanted. We are going to implement
                    it over here.” Mr. Wick said, “No, I am sorry, Mark. I know exactly what the
                    president wants because he had talked to me, and we are going to do,” this, that
                    and the other thing. Impasse. Wick then turned to his secretary, Pat Stevens and
                    said, “Pat, get the President on the phone. We'll settle this.” We all looked
                    up. There was silence on the other end. I assume that Mr. Wick had talked to her
                    in advance. She said, “You mean on his private line, Mr. Wick?” He said, “Yes on
                    his private line.” So she rustled the pages a little bit and began to punch in
                    some numbers. All of a sudden on the other end Mark Palmer said, “Okay, Mr.
                    Wick, you win, We will do it the way you want it. You will, we will do it.” Wick
                    said, “Okay, Pat, just cancel the call to the President.” Big smile on Wick's
                    face. But it was a good lesson. We don't know if he could have gotten through.
                    He did spend time with the president, personal time. We knew he had the number
                    to get through, but I don't know if he could have gotten through or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or if the president would have remembered with all the
                        calls he had.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. But it was the perception of power that is very important. That was
                    a very big factor in USIA under Charlie Wick. Many people did not like him for
                    various reasons. They thought he was a lightweight and a showman and all this.
                    But while he was there, and while President Reagan was in office, USIA had
                    entree into the highest circles of the foreign affairs community whether it be
                    the National Security Council, or the highest level State Department meetings in
                    the morning, because Wick was perceived as having access to the president. No
                    one was going to challenge that, and no none was going to call him on the carpet
                    for that. So his staff, his underlings, his people were accepted and received
                    very warmly and very positively. Perception in Washington is extremely
                    important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely. How did you find the relationship between
                        Wick and Stone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Much better than between Wick and any of his previous deputy directors.
                    Much better. Because Stone wasn't after the job. Everyone else who was there who
                    had taken it was looking at it as a stepping stone, pardon the expression, to
                    other things, political power, etc. Stone was not. He was reluctant to take the
                    job because he had just sold U.S. News and World Report. He was financially well
                    off. He didn't want the hassle. And originally when he was approached he turned
                    it down. Then a mutual friend who was mutually familiar with both Wick and
                    Stone, a man named Leonard Marks who had been head of the U.S. Information
                    Agency and had been Lyndon Johnson's communications lawyer, etc., starting out
                    with Lady Bird Johnson and her television and radio stations. In any case, Marks
                    got Stone. Stone at first turned it down flat. Then about a month later, Marks
                    took Stone out to lunch and said, “you have got to do it for the good of the
                    country. Wick needs you. He is not organized. You know Washington. He needs
                    you.” He said he would do it, and he did. He had a very good relationship. On
                    the contrary, Gene Kopp who was there was all right, but the first deputy
                    director whose name now escapes me, Wick and he did not get along. He was thrust
                    upon Wick by the Republican administration. He decided to build a private dining
                    room for himself. That didn't go over too well. But the problem was this guy,
                    whose name I don't remember at the moment was a business partner of William
                    Safire, the columnist. So this immediately put Mr. Safire and Mr. Wick at each
                    other's throats. Mr. Safire was continually criticizing Wick in his columns
                    because of this former partner who Wick finally got rid of as deputy director.
                    Wick just couldn't stand him. He said, “I want him out of here.” That did
                    happen. Then a rather amusing incident, well after this guy left, but while Mr.
                    Safire was still critical of Mr. Wick in his columns. It happened that both
                    gentlemen were having dinner at the Palm Restaurant on 19th. Street in
                    Washington. Wick finished first and was walking out and he saw Bill Safire. Wick
                    is not an ideologue. He is a nice guy unless you are working for him. He
                    decided, he said, “Hi, Bill.” He decided to walk over and say look, let's let
                    bygones be bygones. He stuck out his hand to shake Safire's hand and knocked a
                    full glass of red wine into Safire's lap. It was an accident, I guess. But
                    that's the way things go sometimes in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>The politics of running an agency in Washington at the senior level is just
                    fascinating because a lot you deal with issues, but you deal with people who
                    deal with issues. On the cultural side a couple of people were thrust into the
                    agency who were just not good. When you see this happening, you somehow manage
                    to pull together, you don't send them away, but you make them less relevant to
                    the workings of the operation even though they have the title. That was one of
                    the things we did very well. You have to vet, you have to vet people coming in
                    for jobs.</p>
                <p>Well before Wick, and this is a story, and I don't know if it is fact but it is a
                    story that was told to me by a former deputy director. During the Frank
                    Shakespeare, the Watergate era, someone was sent over from the While House to be
                    the general counsel of USIA, a man named Gordon Strachan. He was interviewed by
                    the then deputy director, who was a good Republican. It was in the middle of the
                    Watergate era. This was told to me by the then deputy director. The subject of
                    Watergate came up. The deputy director asked him, “Were you, Gordon, in any way
                    involved? Is there any way you could bring discredit on the United States
                    Information Agency if you become general counsel?” This young baby faced kid
                    looked at him and said, “Sir, I was not involved in any way. I didn't do
                    anything that could bring discredit upon the agency.” About a week later the
                    deputy director learned that that very morning, Mr. Strachan was up on the Hill
                    spilling his guts talking about carrying money and various other assorted things
                    dealing with Watergate. This leaked out and of course, he never got the job of
                    general counsel. But veracity is not always front and center in some of the
                    political dealings. You have to be very careful. And you see that when you are
                    dealing at the top it is very critical.</p>
                <p>On assignments. When I was working with the deputy director, it came time for me
                    to be reassigned, he said, “Where do you want to go? Let me know.” He named
                    three places that are out; can't go there. I chose the U.S. mission to the
                    European Community in Brussels. I did the paperwork and I applied. Several weeks
                    later somebody from personnel came to me and said, “Are you sure you want to go
                    to Brussels?” I said, “Yes, I do. I have had the background in economic affairs.
                    I think I can do a good job. I like NATO and am close to that.” “Well you know,
                    there is somebody else that would like this job as well. Would you like to do
                    anything else?” I said, “No, I want Brussels.” Several days later my boss called
                    me in and said, “Do you really want Brussels? Could I tempt you with something
                    else?” I said, “No.” He said, “All right.” But there were obviously people
                    calling trying to get the job, and even now when you apply for jobs at State or
                    something, it is the personal connection that somehow plays a role.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: You have to be qualified, but it is the personal connection that plays a
                    major role in assignments.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And of course, when you get to something like Paris,
                        Brussels and all, all of a sudden all the sharks start swimming around. Well
                        then you went to Brussels in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: 1988. It was July or August when I arrived there in 1988.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there until when?</hi>

                <p>WILSON: I was there until August of '92.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I was the public affairs counselor to the U.S. mission to the European
                    Community which is now called the European Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well, we had several. I am trying to think of who the, we had a political
                    appointee who was a little guy. His name was Alfred Kingon. When I met him he
                    was back in Washington at first before I went over, he had back problems. One of
                    the ways he got this particular back problem was his unfamiliarity with the
                    European bathroom system. I don't know if you know, but in many of the European
                    bathtubs they have a hand held shower, which you could take out of the wall. He
                    did not realize this and being as small as he was, he figured that he could
                    scrunch down underneath it. And he did, and pulled his back out.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>Kingon was a nice guy, but he had very fixed ideas in addition to not being
                    familiar with European bathrooms. He wanted to do some things with other
                    European countries. Of course we were really accredited only to Brussels. He
                    didn't understand that really, and whatever he wanted to do, it was my job. He
                    wanted to do this on the public affairs side, and I attempted to deflect him.
                    What I suggested was look, let's put out a newsletter to American business
                    people operating in various communities around, various centers around the
                    European Union, the European Community and in the United States. It will deal
                    with European affairs, businesses. He thought that this was a great idea. So,
                    there was born and I developed the product that now still exists called the
                    Letter from Brussels, based on some of the New Yorker “letters from.” It was
                    designed for American business people operating in Europe and for their
                    counterpart offices back in the States. I had to get special permission from
                    USIA to do this because USIA is not supposed to send any information to people
                    in the States, at least they weren't. We went through the general counsel's
                    office, and I had to assure them that any mailings to people in the States would
                    be not done by USIA but be done by the State Department which had no such
                    restrictions. It was a very fine line, and it was more of a semantic difference
                    than a real difference, but that was accepted by USIA. I had to figure out how
                    to get a mailing list. I had never done this before. I went to some private
                    organizations in the United States. We got mailing lists, mailing lists
                    throughout Europe. We put out about 800 in our first issue. It was six pages. It
                    had a letter, an editorial from the ambassador. It was mightily successful. I
                    mean, we knew that because several businessmen in Brussels and around Europe who
                    either didn't get their copy or threw it out, came complaining to us saying what
                    the hell are you doing going over our heads to our people back in the States.
                    They are calling us asking us about certain things that you put in there. We
                    don't know anything about them. So it was effective. We put while I was there,
                    we put out about six issues. Well, we probably put out about nine issues. Then
                    it expanded. Everybody liked it and wanted to get stuff in. I left, and it is
                    still going. It is still going now as a matter of fact. It is not in the form
                    that it used to be. It is designed to be a handy quick read form that the CEO
                    could take into the john with him, just glance at it. If you had something that
                    he was interested in, he could underline or tell one of his staff to follow up
                    on this. Well by the time I left, or after I left, years after I left, we got an
                    ambassador named Stu Eizenstadt. He was a good guy. And the first letter form
                    Brussels that came out that I saw under Stu Eizenstadt, had his editorial
                    leading off, which was fine. But his editorial itself was six pages. The whole
                    thing was about 14 or 16. It defeated the whole purpose of the publication. I
                    don't know if it is still going. But I felt good about it because I kept
                    Ambassador Kingon happy. It made a difference to some businessmen. It was useful
                    to people.</p>

                <p>WILSON: It was very clear. We had many trade issues with the Europeans. Some of
                    the issues lent themselves very specifically to public affairs treatment. For
                    example the so-called bST issue which is hormones fed to cattle, a hormone
                    called bovine s somatotropin you feed cattle to make them fatter, make them
                    produce more meat. The Europeans were fighting this. They didn't want to have
                    this kind of tainted meat imported into European countries. Our job was to try
                    to get out the word that this is not dangerous. That scientifically at least
                    this is not going to cause any problems. We did this through newspaper articles.
                    We did this through bringing over experts that would talk on radio programs or
                    television programs. We used our international visitors program to send people
                    from the European Community who made some of the decisions, to the States to go
                    to Monsanto and other places to see exactly what was done. This was a made for
                    public affairs kind of issue, and it is still going on.</p>

                        article in the paper today in the Washington Post.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, exactly. It is still going on. An offshoot of this which hasn't got
                    as much publicity is porcine somatotropin, the same type of stuff you give to
                    cows except this is going to pigs, pork. Several European countries were using
                    this, such as the Netherlands. India was using it, and Israel was using it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Israel, yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well one of the big pork producers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Israel is. They export it. A big pork exporter believe it or not. The
                    reason the Netherlands is using it is the pST provides much more meat and much
                    less waste, so that in a small country like the Netherlands pig droppings are a
                    big problem. If you can have less droppings and more meat, you are well ahead of
                    the game. But this still hasn't been totally accepted by the European
                    Community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying there was another issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Lots of issues. Certainly there was the issue of American films,
                    particularly in France.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well France is the major producer of films in Europe. It
                        is a big industry.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Italy produces a lot. I will get back to films, the thing I was going to
                    talk about is tobacco. This gave me a personal problem. Not the cigarette side
                    so much, though I always marveled at the American legislation which did not
                    require cigarette manufacturers to put a warning on cigarettes for export. That
                    really bothered me. In any case, a company called the American Tobacco Company
                    produces chewing tobacco. Something you chew. Baseball players, well they don't
                    use it anymore. It is cancer causing. There was a big issue, the European, the
                    British parliament passed a law. The heads of American Tobacco Company got a
                    hold of State Department people, I won't quote their names, and they said you
                    have really got to get to the Europeans and get them to change their position on
                    this. We can't have the European Parliament, the European Commission adopting a
                    ban on distribution of chewing tobacco in Europe. Obviously this was pointing
                    toward doing some public affairs operation. I personally talked to the
                    ambassador and said, “Look, I cannot do this. I will not do this. This is
                    something I can't do.” He was not happy about it either. From my Geneva
                    experience, I had gotten to know Dr. Koop, the surgeon general. When I was back
                    in this country I talked to him about it. He said, “Well, you know, if we take
                    this up as an issue, as a government issue. Let me know.” I was prepared to. I
                    would never do this under most circumstances, but I was really ticked off.
                    Finally the ambassador was able to convince Secretary Eagleburger to let it
                    drop, and we did not have to push it. I would have been very hard pressed to
                    push the Europeans to letting in chewing tobacco if they wanted to keep it out.
                    I could not have done that. I would not have done it. I mean it was a moral
                    issue as far as, it was not a health issue to me, it was a moral issue. And I
                    did not have to, because the ambassador backed me up on it. We did not have to
                    pursue it. That was a major problem.</p>
                <p>On films, Jack Valenti and company established an office in Brussels that had
                    three or so people dealing with it. There is a very interesting series of events
                    that I think, was interesting for the Foreign Service. One incident will
                    suffice. Back in the late 80's, early 90's was a time when you were just getting
                    E-mail. Some were classified; some were not. Sometimes you had faxes but it was
                    often E-mail. Two incidents. The U.S. Mission to the European Community had
                    representatives from the Department of Commerce, Department of State, U.S. Trade
                    Representative's office, Department of Agriculture. They were all there. The one
                    that wasn't there, and the one the ambassador strongly resisted and rightly so
                    was CIA. They were in the embassy down the street, but they were not allowed to
                    penetrate our operation. The ambassador was very firm. But in any case, the head
                    of the Commerce operation was a nice guy. He wasn't terribly swift, but he was a
                    nice guy. He was using some of the new technology, the E-mail technology, and he
                    typed up something that was highly critical of some of his superiors back in
                    Washington as kind of a joke. It was really critical. He didn't delete it, and
                    he sent it in error. All kinds of problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, God.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>WILSON: In any case that was the humorous side. In another case, now this shows
                    you some of the problems. Because of the six hour time difference, Washington
                    usually wakes up about four or five o'clock in the afternoon, which was before
                    they sent out cables and things which is about ten or eleven o'clock in Europe
                    anywhere you are. Our USTR guy particularly had this problem and would often get
                    calls at home you have got to do this, that, or the other thing. At one point he
                    got a call at home saying we want you to take into the European Community the
                    following message concerning XYZ, whatever it was. He was told, when you get in
                    you will find it on your E-mail in the office. Print it up properly and deliver
                    it to the European Commission. Well Chris did as he was told. He got it typed up
                    and sent over about 11:00 in the morning. Well, he just forgot. He was on good
                    relations with the ambassador, he just forgot to mention it to the ambassador.
                    Between one and two o'clock, the ambassador got a call not from Carla Hills but
                    from her deputy, it will come to me, saying the message that we asked Chris to
                    send over to the European Commission, we have changed our minds. We don't want
                    it sent. Of course the ambassador didn't know anything about it because Chris
                    hadn't shown it to him. The ambassador got Chris right up and saw the message.
                    He said, “Well I am glad they didn't want to sent it.” Chris told him “I have
                    already sent it.” Because of the work habits of the Europeans, Chris got over
                    there probably about 11:30, 11:45. It was put in the box of whoever was supposed
                    to receive it. He could go over about two or two thirty and take it out of the
                    box. Nobody had gotten to it yet. The thing that I want to point out here is the
                    fragility of dealing with new telecommunications technology in trying to develop
                    foreign policy, because this did not go through the State Department. It didn't
                    go through anybody except the deputy U.S. trade representative. Jules Katz is
                    the guy. It went through him. It went through Chris Marsas, the U.S. Trade Rep
                    in Brussels, and it was taken over to the Commission. This is a major problem.
                    Right now, obviously, E-mails are going all over the place, classified,
                    unclassified. What is policy, what is not policy? Is policy only that which
                    comes out in a formal telegram which comes out from the Department of State? Or
                    are there other ways to interpret policy, particularly if you are dealing with a
                    multi-faceted agency approach to policy, because the U.S. Trade Representative's
                    office often has a different view from the Department of Commerce or from the
                    Department of Agriculture, and does State have a view? In my view, speaking of
                    views, the State Department way back in the 70's abandoned its interest in
                    economic and commercial affairs and turned it over to the Department of
                    Commerce. Even in the mid-80's, State was reluctant to get back involved. To put
                    it bluntly, they didn't want to dirty their hands in these types of things. They
                    are more into big policy issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know. There has always been this thrust to get the hell
                        out of consular affairs too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>WILSON: Exactly. State never wanted to get their hands sullied in this case, in
                    the case of Commerce. Now they really have to if they are going to take the lead
                    in foreign policy, as they should. State really is the one place where all this
                    should come together. Now, with modern communications technology, State has to
                    assert itself. Whether it is at the classified or unclassified level, how do you
                    know whether an instruction from Washington that it is U.S. government policy.
                    This causes enormous problems.</p>
                <p>I was not there, but it was related to me by the political counselor who stayed
                    behind or who came after I did actually and worked very closely with Ambassador
                    Stu Eizenstadt. There were some negotiations that were going on. The State
                    Department ruled that when these things are happening between the U.S. and the
                    European Community, the European Union, often business representatives are there
                    for the U. S. side, and for the European side as well. These negotiations are
                    going on with the State Department and the Justice Department. Justice is also
                    involved. In fact, I forgot to mention Justice also has an operation there,
                    ruled that the American business people could not talk to each other because
                    that would be in violation of anti-trust, and they couldn't get together and
                    talk. That was the ruling; I'm deadly serious. It was only because Stu
                    Eizenstadt was so plugged into the administration, when he heard about this that
                    he got on the phone to his friends at Justice and State, and they said stop this
                    nonsense. The Europeans talk to each other. Our guys, we have got to talk to
                    each other or we just break off these negotiations because we can't do it. Both
                    Justice and State backed off. But you don't always have a Stu Eizenstadt. You
                    have got to figure out some way to have common sense policy and coordinated
                    policies. I truly hope that the new department under Colin Powell can make some
                    kind of minor breakthrough in these areas, particularly the coordination of
                    policy involving other government agencies. How you do this is to be strong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you were there, how did you find it, especially
                        as public affairs counselor? They have got a mission to NATO, a mission to
                        Belgium, and is there another one there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No that's enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's enough.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: In Geneva we had six (ambassadors). We only had three here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were used to this. Would you get together for
                        lunches just to make sure you all were singing the same hymn?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>WILSON: That is exactly what happened. There was no organizational structure to
                    achieve this, and so the public affairs officer at NATO and I and the public
                    affairs officer to the kingdom, we would get together and try to coordinate this
                    on the political level with what was going on. It was particularly true with us
                    and NATO because the issues are very similar. We worked extraordinarily closely,
                    and we helped establish some coordinated policies. We tried to establish regular
                    meetings between the political officers in NATO and the political officers to
                    the U.S. Mission to the European Community. It was critical that we would go
                    back with one voice, that we would have one point of view. You are absolutely
                    right. Indeed the public affairs people took the initiative in this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was your impression of the staff in the
                        European Community at that time because, particularly I am thinking more on
                        the political rather than the professional side, it seems to have gotten
                        into making too many rules and over-managing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: You mean the Commission itself?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: They did some of that. The Brits were particularly distraught about some
                    of the rule making. The French were very distraught about the kind of milk that
                    could go into cheeses. They got the rule making at a very low level, which they
                    probably shouldn't do. One thing they were trying to do, and they have been a
                    little more successful now. When they got successful we began to get cold feet,
                    is to coordinate at the political level and to try to coordinate with NATO on
                    the military level. They have a political directorate, composed of people from
                    the various countries, from all the countries. But because you have so many
                    countries involved, once you make a decision at the European Community, you have
                    to go back to these 15 countries and get approval from their foreign offices for
                    any changes. It is very difficult. One time when this didn't happen, all hell
                    broke loose. It is a good example which will be remembered by people concerned
                    the Balkans. It concerned the breakup of Yugoslavia. For whatever reason, the
                    then German foreign minister Hans Dietrich Genscher, who according to some of my
                    German foreign affairs colleagues used to carry the foreign affairs portfolio
                    around in his hat or his pocket, wouldn't tell anybody. The German delegation at
                    the European Community was pushing for European, EU, EC, recognition of Croatia.
                    We thought that was a major mistake. Our ambassador to the EC at the time, a man
                    named Tom Niles who had been in Yugoslavia...</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Okay, interesting. I was in his office one time. He pleaded you have got
                    to try and stop this; it is too premature. It is premature, the “too” is not
                    necessary. But the Europeans rushed ahead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly the Germans did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, powered by the Germans. No, Powered by Hans Dietrich Genscher. The
                    EC recognized Croatia, big mistake at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And followed rather shortly at the time by the Vatican
                        recognizing Croatia, which as anybody who served in Serbia as I did knew,
                        the Germans and the Vatican had been very nasty players there in W.W.II.
                        This set off all sorts of alarms there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: And it should have. Were you there, was a guy named Don Tice there when
                    you were there?</p>

                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>WILSON: Okay, because, anyway I didn't realize you were there the same time Tom
                    Niles was. Interesting situation with Tom Niles. He came with a reputation, he
                    came from Canada, and I had served in Canada. He came with a reputation as
                    ambassador of not really caring about public affairs. As a matter of fact, being
                    anti-public affairs, anti-public diplomacy type stuff. Everyone was terrified.
                    He and I got along extraordinarily well. Not only was he not anti, but he was in
                    favor of expanding things. I mean he saw a “letter from Brussels.” People
                    thought he was going to kill it. He loved it; he wanted to keep it going.
                    Secondly he wanted to expand our exchange programs, the International Visitors
                    Program. He was extraordinarily supportive of that because at that point we had
                    maybe five or six people we could send. When the head of the bureau of
                    educational and cultural affairs came through Brussels, Niles went out of his
                    way to give him a lunch and a dinner. Niles is a good politician. He may appear
                    to many people to be cold, but he is not. We lived near each other; we both
                    liked dogs. We got along very well. He was very hospitable to the head of the
                    bureau of education and cultural affairs. He wanted very much to expand the
                    International Visitor's Program. I had come back to Washington to try to
                    accomplish that, and I talked to the head of the European International Visitors
                    Program. I said, “Look, if we could just take two IV's (international visitors)
                    each from Germany, France England, those countries, possibly Italy, they won't
                    miss them because they have 20-25, and we would use them here and it would be
                    very helpful.” I got flat turned down. Niles said we will figure out some way of
                    doing it. In the middle of the Uruguay round of trade negotiations that had been
                    going on in Brussels, I got a phone call from the office, because these were
                    held out at the conference center, please get back, please call the head of the
                    bureau of education and cultural affairs. I said, “Look, let me get back to him
                    in a couple of days because of this conference.” “No, he wants to talk to you
                    now.” So I called him. He said, “We are giving you $100,000 for your IV
                    program.” I said, “You are kidding.” He said, “No we are giving you $100,000 for
                    the IV program. It's yours.” So I went back and I told the ambassador. He was
                    delighted. Two days later when the conference was over, I got all kinds of nasty
                    phone calls from the rest of the bureau of education and cultural affairs. “How
                    could you do this. You are taking our money. You can't do that.” I said, “Well,
                    Dr. Glade said it is my money; we can do it. See, if you had given me just the
                    two I wanted from these four countries, it wouldn't have happened. But you
                    brought this on yourselves.” They were not happy, but I realized I have got to
                    work with them, so what we did, with Ambassador Niles's approval, was to
                    construct a program where we would take this money and allow the U.S. embassies
                    from these European countries, who were members of the European Community, to
                    select IV's who were particularly involved in European Community affairs. They
                    were; every country had these people. The only thing is we would have to approve
                    them and they would have to come through Brussels for some briefings. So this
                    made everybody happy. We had increased our IV program. The other countries did
                    not lose their IV's. In fact they got to send more. They chafed a little bit at
                    our having to approve, but they got over that very quickly. It worked out
                    extremely well. So we quadrupled the size of our IV program thanks to Tom Niles
                    and thanks to the support that we had from the bureau of educational and
                    cultural affairs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things were you doing in the straight public
                        affairs side with dealing with the European Community at that time? How did
                        you deal with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: First of all, you have correspondents of all major European newspapers
                    based in Brussels. Whether it was Swiss papers or French papers or German
                    papers, they were all there. So you dealt with them. You made certain that when
                    they were writing stories about various issues that came up in the European
                    Union, European community, they had the U.S. perspective. I mean, that was
                    clear. Both wire services, Reuters, AP, very important in dealing with them. So
                    you did the traditional press side of the operation very well, not easily, but
                    you had the contacts that you wanted to have. You talked about our cooperating
                    with NATO, we set up a series of seminars once a year with our NATO colleagues,
                    we helped fund it. I later caught hell from my old organization, the inspector
                    general's office because they said that I was screwing around with the money in
                    different fiscal years. We funded three conferences while I was there in England
                    bringing in people not only from Brussels but from European countries to discuss
                    EU and NATO issues, where they joined. These were often not only academics but
                    journalists. At that point, I remember, one of the people we had as a guest
                    speaker from the United States was Condoleezza Rice. She was then on the
                    National Security Council. We had people come over, and we worked this out very
                    nicely. Where I ran into trouble was the conference would usually take place in
                    the spring in England, April, May. If I had money left over from the preceding
                    fiscal year, I would send that money to the organization that was organizing the
                    conference for us, because they had to get mailing lists out. They had to do
                    some mailings in advance, so it was technically legitimate. No question about
                    that. But the IG didn't like that too much. Well we got it done, and there was
                    nothing they could bitch about because technically we were safe. We did do this
                    kind of thing, and we cooperated very strongly between our mission to NATO and
                    the European Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find particularly the European Community at that
                        time, the economic side was, of course, sort of what was driving it, wasn't
                        it? I mean at that point. When you start getting into American products and
                        all it is a continuing battle, particularly with the French. Did you find
                        the problem of globalization, which usually means American firms like
                        McDonald's or the Pizza Huts or the food but also other businesses, raises a
                        red flag in Europe, or at least does today. Was it then or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No. Globalization was not a term that we used at all. I mean, it was not
                    an issue. American films were an issue; American television was an issue, but
                    globalization of other industries was not an issue. Standards were an issue. Is
                    the European Union, the European Community using standards to block imports or
                    this kind of thing? But globalization as such, as you now described it, was not
                    an issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about on movies and such? Basically, the only real
                        powerful movie industry in Europe, maybe I am wrong, other ones had had it
                        but they sort of withered, would be the French. The British, but was there a
                        constant? I mean, did you get involved in this cultural battle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well, to a small extent yes, but we were involved in distribution of
                    American films. This was where the French were really, “what about subtitles,”
                    “what about voiceovers?” that kind of stuff. But American films were pretty much
                    accepted. The French were the ones who were bitching about American culture
                    dominating and taking over. That was their concern. We didn't deal that much
                    with the French from Brussels. I did though, because of a quirk in the USIA
                    staffing, become responsible for the public affairs work in Paris at the OECD.
                    So I would go to France maybe once every three weeks. I would go in and out for
                    the day, which is easy enough to do. Looking back on it, I was too honest. I
                    should have stayed over a couple of nights in Paris. I didn't. I could have
                    because the trains went back and forth very quickly. Now they go even more
                    quickly. It was a good, a nice two and a half hour ride.</p>
                <p>What happened was the State Department had pulled out the PAO from the OECD.
                    Margaret Tutwiler liked him, a guy named George Kennedy. Do you know George? So
                    there was no public affairs officer at OECD, public affairs person. Well, there
                    was. The head of the public affairs for OECD was the former USIA person, but
                    nothing for the mission. So I would go. And the PAO in Paris at that time, named
                    Bud Korngold, who is a good friend said he didn't want anything to do with the
                    OECD. He had his own problems and he wanted to deal with them. So I got assigned
                    to the OECD because many of the issues they discussed in the OECD were similar
                    to the issues they dealt with in Brussels. So I became the de facto public
                    affairs officer for the mission to the OECD as well. It only became a little bit
                    difficult when the OECD had its annual general meeting, and all the big wigs
                    coming in, and the speaker or somebody from the OECD coming in for press work in
                    a different area, and I would go in. But I did not get involved in French type
                    things. Whenever I went to Paris, I made a point of seeing the PAO or the IO in
                    Paris, so he would not feel I was stepping on his toes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were there '88 to '92 when a small little thing
                        happened. That was essentially the fall of the Soviet Union and the
                        reunification of Germany. From your working point, did that make any changes
                        or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>WILSON: I think subtly yes. One of the problems we always face, and if you talk
                    to the people involved they would say the same thing, was the concern that the
                    members of the European Community had, and the Germans in particular, that the
                    Germans should not become too dominant in the community because of the
                    experience that Europe had with Germany. They are extraordinarily competent. It
                    was an unspoken kind of concern, you have got to make sure the Germans don't
                    take over. When German unity came, this fear, this concern, was heightened. It
                    was a very difficult thing for the Community itself. They did not want the
                    Germans to take over all the good jobs, and yet they realized the problems that
                    Germany had economically trying to get the eastern European, Eastern Germany to
                    unify with the rest of the country. Yes, it was a concern to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you left there in '92. Were there any other major
                        problems or issues that you were dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: What I was dealing with then is stuff they are dealing with now. When I
                    came, pasta, the kind of wheat that you have. Some of these issues just don't go
                    away. Yes, they were always there. The agricultural subsidies that the European
                    Commission, European Community, gives to its farmers. A big issue. Major issue.
                    That is not going away. The Europeans, of course, complained about some of our
                    subsidies we give. One person's subsidy is another person's need to exist. I
                    mean the Europeans contend the hallmark of Europe is the small farmer, and they
                    have to keep that small farmer going. These issues did not go away. They are
                    there now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just watching French TV yesterday, and in Brussels
                        the whole place was shut down because farmers came again. I am not sure what
                        the issue was. It was an European issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: When we were there, they came in with their tractors. They shut down the
                    whole place at least twice. We also dealt, of course, with the European
                    Parliament in Strasbourg, though there wasn't a hell of a lot you could do with
                    that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: I came back to work in the E bureau, education and cultural exchange, an

                    he asked me if I wanted to head up a new office.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Was a Foreign Service Officer named Barry Fulton, because the director, a
                    political appointee, had left in anticipation of the election. The new office
                    was to be called the office of policy and evaluation. The reason for the new
                    office was about a decade earlier, the E Bureau had an office of policy which
                    was a total fiasco, a total failure. They just determined that it was very
                    difficult to get academic types intellectual types, I will put “intellectual” in
                    quotation marks, types to conform to policy. And policy was a very negative,
                    very bad word, but by combining evaluation of programs with policy, it was
                    thought that we could make some progress. And indeed we did. I agreed to take
                    this on even though it was a very small bureau, a very small subdivision of the
                    bureau. The other office directors, head people, had 30-40 people. I had five or
                    six.</p>

                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>WILSON: I probably was better off. The first real issue came when we were trying
                    to decide what initials we should give to this new office. I kind of having a
                    flair for doing out of the box stuff, decided well, hell, they have E and EA, I
                    am going to call my new office EZ. They said “Why EZ?” I said, “Because it is
                    the end of the alphabet. It is the last office that is going to be created. It
                    sounds good.” “Well people are going to call it easy.” “Whatever they want to
                    call it.” After about three weeks the director called me and said, “Do you
                    really want to go with EZ?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Well if you really want to,
                    I will go along with it, but I think it is crazy.” It has stuck. It is still
                    there. With all the other E this and E that, we have EZ. The next point was
                    finding sort of a deputy for me, and the acting director of the bureau was a
                    little bit apologetic. He had interviewed a couple of people. He said, “I think
                    this person is a very good candidate for you. Why don't you talk with him.” His
                    name was Peter Clawson. He said, “Don't be taken back by his looks.” I met him
                    and he had a ponytail. Ordinarily, I would have said what the hell. But since
                    the acting director had interviewed him and I respect his judgment, I
                    interviewed Peter. I talked with him, went out to lunch, and I got along very
                    well with him. He was a young officer. He was on the make. He had just been
                    divorced and was getting another wife in Germany, and he was a good person to
                    work with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his experience in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: He had been in either Afghanistan or Pakistan. He had served a tour in
                    Germany and was now back in Washington. But he was fine. He was probably in his
                    mid 30's. He was a good officer. The policy side was more difficult than the
                    evaluation side. The problem with the evaluation side was not that we had
                    trouble with evaluations but that we had trouble getting money for evaluations.
                    People never like to be evaluated. If we did an evaluation it would cost
                    somewhere between ten and thirty thousand dollars. When this office was set up,
                    I began getting calls from people, Dr. this and Dr. that from this university
                    and that university saying could we do evaluations. We do them for AID; we would
                    be glad to do them for you. Well it quickly became apparent that although they
                    said they would like to do them for us, the remuneration was so pitiful compared
                    to what AID paid that nobody from the outside was really interested. AID, I
                    discovered, for an evaluation of a program where you have to go overseas for
                    anywhere from three to five or six weeks, AID pays a minimum of $250,000.
                    Minimum. We were paying a maximum of $25 or $30,000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes one gets the feeling, and this is a prejudiced
                        thing, AID had become sort of a milk cow or something for the academic
                        institutions.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>WILSON: Well not only academic, but the beltway bandits. There are tremendous
                    amounts of money spent for no reason whatsoever. That was always a problem for
                    us in getting evaluations done. We got involved in a lot of controversial
                    evaluations such as the overseas book translation program. You know, if a post
                    decides it is important for its program to translate a certain book into say,
                    Spanish, and it is agreed by the area officer in Washington, why does it take
                    upwards of 18-24 months to get this thing done? By the time they get this thing
                    done, the CAO who requested it is probably gone. These are the kinds of things
                    we came up with in evaluations. Another thing that we discovered is when a
                    program hires a school or organization to run a particular aspect of this
                    program, let's say they are hired to run the whole program, there was no, and I
                    suspect there still is no ongoing fiscal accountability. Money is doled out on a
                    basis, with a schedule set up in advance, and the program officers don't really
                    now what the hell is going on. The people that are running the program send
                    their reports in to a budget type person who really doesn't care what is going
                    on in the program as long as the budget reports are there. The program officer
                    never sees any of the ongoing reports. There is no responsibility between the
                    program officer and the program that he or she is supposedly running. This was a
                    major problem. When we tried to correct it we ran up against all kinds of
                    entrenched bureaucratic turf fighting. The budget and fiscal people said, no, we
                    have got to have those reports. We don't care about the program officer. The
                    program officers basically said we have so many programs to run we are too busy
                    to look at these reports. Therefore, most of the work was going on
                    helter-skelter, pell-mell, without anyone really checking to see the
                    effectiveness of the result. That was a problem. We reported on it. I am not
                    certain much was done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine that as you started doing this,
                        particularly the evaluation side, you would begin to take on a certain
                        amount of the aspect of an inspector, inspector general, and this would not
                        make you overly popular particularly since you were right in the
                        headquarters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. I was certainly outside of the bureau in the first place. I was more
                    on the information side of the operations, more the political side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The E bureau, what does that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Bureau of educational and cultural affairs, which is now ECA in the new
                    Department of State, education and cultural affairs. Up until the late 70's it
                    had been part of the Department of State, and then it was switched over to USIA.
                    In '98-'99 it was switched back into the Department of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this period you were dealing with, what did education
                        consist of?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>WILSON: A lot of exchange programs. Whether the international visitors program,
                    Fulbright exchange program, other exchange programs, visitors exchange programs,
                    that's what it consisted of. University to university programs that type of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking, and I am not really sure if it is a prejudice,
                        my gut feeling is this is probably one of the most important things that our
                        government does, getting people over, moving into our society, taking a look
                        how we work. It is very revolutionary because when these people eventually
                        go back over, they have a different appreciation for the United States, and
                        they are also kind of doing things the way we do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well, I don't know if they do things the way we do them, but you are
                    actually right. I developed an appreciation for these types of programs because
                    I had been more on the fast information side, and this education program, the
                    effects of these educational and cultural exchange programs are seen only in the
                    medium to longer term. It is not an instant result, and you have to take a
                    little bit on faith that things are going to work out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you know, I think the big thing one can look at today
                        is how many mainland Chinese have come to the United States. This has to
                        have had, in the long run, a profound effect.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well, something that I never knew, this has nothing to do with my work.
                    It is my extracurricular activities with my old college. I learned, the college
                    that I had gone to had closed its library school. I was dealing with a lady who
                    was heading the library school out here at the University of Maryland. I was
                    dealing with her for a variety of reasons on a personal level. We had talked
                    about the closing of the library school at Columbia. She said, “That was all
                    political.” She then went on to tell me, she gave me one of her cards. One side
                    was in English, the other side was in Chinese. She pointed out that long before
                    the ping pong diplomacy with the Chinese, Columbia University school of library
                    science had an ongoing and extraordinarily effective exchange program with
                    librarians in China. During the Chinese cultural revolution, it was these
                    Columbia University trained librarians that managed to keep some of the material
                    together from being destroyed and various archives, keep it together. You had
                    ping pong diplomacy with Kissinger and Nixon. Long before that you had library
                    diplomacy which I had never known.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I hadn't either.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It seemingly has paid off and paid off handsomely. This lady is now the
                    head of the Maryland school of library science and spends a lot of time in the
                    far east and China recruiting students. Quite interesting. But it all stems form
                    this Columbia University exchange program.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a look at the educational exchange program? I
                        mean was it possible to kind of evaluate it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well not overall, but the individual program and individual components,
                    sure. Long before I arrived there, the bureau had put out a supposedly annual
                    report on exchange programs, government wide. It was a fiasco. It was a bust. It
                    was three or four years behind. It wasn't really being done. The officer that
                    was running it didn't want to handle it, and so the acting director asked me if
                    I would take this on and put some new life into the annual report. I was very
                    hesitant because I realized it was a tar baby. I didn't know if I could ever get
                    out of it, but because of personal ties and because he said you have really got
                    to help me, I am really stuck on this, I said, “Yes.” And I did. And we put out
                    the first new annual report of the cultural and educational exchanges run by the
                    government. Not just by USIA and State Department, but by the whole government.
                    We pulled these things together from agencies across the government. It was
                    remarkable. It was, first of all, the number of exchanges was incredible. People
                    didn't know about a lot of them. We still don't know about a lot of them. When I
                    left the office we were up to, well even now, we were over $2,000,000,000 in
                    government funded exchanges, not with one single agency but with a whole slew of
                    agencies across the government. The greatest exchange programs, of course, at
                    least in the greatest number of dollars came from the Department of Defense.
                    They don't want to talk about it, but they run them. AID runs some. AID isn't
                    even certain what they run. An amusing story, one of the organizations that gets
                    money from the government to run exchange programs is the National Endowment for
                    Democracy. Okay, this is logical. They work for an organization, the
                    International Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute, the
                    chamber of commerce and the labor group. Unfortunately, money from the congress
                    was funded through USIA. So it was incumbent upon us to see what these
                    organizations were doing. I naturally got ahold of them and said, could you give
                    us a rundown. They said, “We really have no idea. We can't tell you what is
                    going on. We just get the money from you and we funnel it to, we don't know what
                    the hell is happening. You have got to go to the individual organizations and
                    talk to them.” It is an example of total irresponsibility in a bureaucracy, but
                    it was not unusual. We had a lot of trouble getting data out of many of the
                    organizations because they feared if we got data out of them we would give it to
                    the congress, and they would get their budgets cut. So this was always a big
                    problem. AID was particularly sensitive in this area. They never wanted to come
                    through and really say what exchange programs they were doing. It was a mess. A
                    couple of times some congressional subcommittees on the House side were
                    investigating AID and its relationship to USIA and exchange programs in Africa.
                    There were major problems. I mean, the political guy who headed the E bureau at
                    the time sort of had to lie to the congress and say, “Oh yes we are cooperating
                    very well with AID and there is no overlap,” whereas in truth there was bitter
                    distention. There was bitter fighting. For example, in South Africa AID set up
                    what they called the Mandela Economics Scholars program spending $50,000 per
                    grantee on a very few number of grantees whereas the program that USIA was
                    running was spending $10-$15,000 on an exchangee and being much more effective.
                    But these are the kinds of things you run across.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>In any case, we put out our first report. We got a professional organization in
                    Alexandria, Virginia to do the cover. We won for that year the award for the
                    best government publication, art design, and it was very effective. One of the
                    minor ironies of this is when I left the office in 1996 to go over to the office
                    of inspector general as a team leader, one of my old staff called me and said,
                    “Look we are putting out a series of statistics on exchange programs, graphs and
                    charts and things, and would it be all right if we used the cover from this
                    report?” I said, “Sure, because it is our report and we have the rights to it.”
                    Well, the cover showed in a very abstract way, dancers. The then counselor of
                    the USIA, a newly minted counselor, a woman named Ann Sigmund. I won't
                    characterize her except to say, well I won't characterize her because she is now
                    the deputy inspector general. But she is singularly lacking in a sense of humor.
                    I will leave it at that. She does not like libraries and that type of operation.
                    In any case, this report that we were putting out, my old office was putting
                    out, came across her desk. She saw it, at least. She was outraged. She said,
                    “How can you put out a report like this showing dancers? You can't send it to
                    the congress.” By that time, my office had already sent it to the congress. She
                    said, “this looks like what a bunch of pansies would do, you can't send a report
                    with dancers on it to the congress. You have got to show that we are hard
                    nailed, tough guys,” which is a ridiculous approach. It was fine. We had
                    absolutely no trouble with it. When I left, the office was expanded. It got a
                    lot more funding. We didn't have to go begging every time to the office of the
                    director to get money for this evaluation or that evaluation. The office was
                    given a couple of million dollars, and it was going strong ever since.</p>
                <p>One little aspect of this office, again, because they didn't know where to put
                    it. There is a little organization known as the cultural property committee. No
                    one wanted to have any responsibility for it. When I had been up to the deputy
                    director's office, I mediated a couple of disputes between the head of that
                    office and her deputy. Each of them came from different political parties and it
                    was a problem. So when I was in this new EZ office, they said, “Hey could you
                    take this on? We don't know where else to put it; take it under your wing.” I
                    said, “sure.” Because I had enjoyed that, and indeed we did do a lot of good
                    work with the cultural property advisory committee protecting cultural property
                    at the request of countries who asked that their cultural patrimony be protected
                    from sales in the United States, this type of thing. It was very useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give an example of the sort of thing that you
                        would be doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>WILSON: Well the committee consisted of about seven or eight private individuals,
                    and they would meet. For example, Italy comes in with a request to save certain
                    objects, to say that they can't be imported. They come in with supporting data.
                    The cultural property advisory committee meets. They examine the data and then
                    they will go back and ask for more data, more details. It goes back and forth
                    for three or four years. If, indeed, their criteria are satisfied, they then
                    issue a draft regulation which then has to go through the State Department. It
                    is part of the State Department, actually, so it is all right. A ban might or
                    might not be placed on the importation of certain cultural objects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they get involved at all in trying to get museums or
                        collectors to return things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well, they were involved a little bit in that, yes. One of the problems
                    that we found was that a member of the cultural property advisory committee,
                    they are usually fairly wealthy individuals because they collect themselves, had
                    donated certain objects to the Williams College art museum. Somebody was up
                    there, and they said, “Hey, this stuff is not kosher. We don't know the
                    provenance of this stuff.” So there was a lot of debate going on. The person who
                    was on the committee quietly resigned.</p>
                <p>The other thing they were getting into, that the State Department was into now,
                    is if a foreign country sends a piece of art over for exhibit, who is to
                    guarantee that some American citizens aren't going to bring suit to keep it?
                    These are ongoing issues that the cultural property advisory committee expanded
                    from one person to three people. It was a growing concern. It is now at State. I
                    don't know where it is under. No one really wants it because it is one of those
                    oddball operations, but every now and then it gets into the news, and it is very
                    important. A lot of the protection was from Latin American countries, from Peru,
                    from the Andes, for some Aztec object, you know, it is just various areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then in '96 you left this part of the E bureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. Well, before that, just something that should be noted historically.
                    Back in '94, I had been asked by the director of human resources, personnel for
                    USIA to head up a promotion panel from the 1 to the OC level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is basically from colonel to brigadier general. It
                        is an important jump.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, it really is. I, at the time, was an MC and I said that was fine,
                    sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: MC being minister counselor.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. And meanwhile, the year's promotion list came out, and five women
                    who were at the 1 level who felt they should be at the OC level brought suit
                    against the director of personnel, against the Information Agency saying they
                    were discriminated against because of sex, gender. Okay, I was paying somewhat
                    close attention to this, and I talked to people who headed the panel before, and
                    I got to know the pitfalls. One day the director of personnel came into my
                    office and closed the door. I had a little office, about the size of this room.
                    Okay, I don't need a big office. He said, “Look, I have got to ask you
                    something. You know, I went to Stanford, and I am a WASP. I am really being hit
                    by this suit. I am going to ask you to step aside as chairman of the panel. I
                    need to appoint a woman. I have got to appoint a woman Foreign Service Officer.
                    It is just too much pressure.” So, what could I say. I stepped aside. A woman
                    was appointed chairman of the panel, and lo and behold in the next round all
                    five officers who brought suit got promoted. Isn't that surprising. That really
                    knocked my socks off; I was flabbergasted. A year later in the fall of '95 they
                    asked me if I would chair the panel again in the spring of '96. I said I would,
                    and I did. It worked fine except that one of the difficulties was that that was
                    the year they had very little money, and so whereas in the past years the
                    promotions in USIA from 1 to OC numbered anywhere plus or minus 15, in this year
                    we were not told in advance, but it was generally known, the number of
                    promotions was seven. That made it very difficult, extremely difficult, because
                    we did not know in advance where the cutoff would be but we did know that it was
                    going to be lower. Even then there was considerable pressure to promote one
                    person who was very good, at least on paper. She was an African American. If you
                    looked at the comments that were made about her you could not have helped but
                    promote her. Indeed, she was promoted. A decision that I regret, but then again
                    given the facts as they were laid out, there was nothing that we could do about
                    it. She merited promotion. It then turned out that she had written all of her
                    stuff herself, and had people sign them. She was very limited in her experience.
                    She had experience in Africa. They assigned her to western Europe because her
                    husband was not a government employee. He was in London. She was an utter
                    disaster where she was. But they were waiting to make the assignment until they
                    saw she got promoted. There was no direct pressure, but certainly indirect
                    pressure to promote this woman. We did, and it was a mistake. Again, looking at
                    the record as it laid in front of us, you could not help but promote her. And
                    promotion or not, it is not an individual decision. The panel was four people,
                    and you had to make those decisions. In any case, after this panel experience, I
                    went over to the office of the inspector general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was essentially from '96 to '98.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: From the fall of '96, from September of '96 to November of '98. I went
                    over as a team leader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Meaning what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>WILSON: Meaning I was heading an inspection team, my team. I was the first USIA
                    originated team leader that the OIG ever had, the inspector general's office
                    ever had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time, I can't remember, was USIA amalgamated into
                        the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No, but we knew it was going to be. I mean it was up on the Hill, and the
                    amalgamation didn't take place until the fall of '99, but everything had been
                    set into place for it to happen. So I went over. I had a lot to learn. I didn't
                    have that much to learn about the State Department operation. That I knew, but I
                    had to learn about how the OIG conducted itself and what you did, etc. I learned
                    from my deputy, a senior State Department officer who was a bit of a
                    curmudgeon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: A guy named Gary Sutton. I had an admin person on my team. I think I had
                    two admin people on my team. I had a consular officer and a USIA officer. It was
                    a good team. Of course being my first time out, we did the eastern Caribbean
                    including Trinidad Tobago, Guyana, one other place. It was an experience for me.
                    It was quite an experience, particularly when I got to Trinidad, where there was
                    a political ambassador who had replaced a career ambassador. The political
                    ambassador was from the Boston area. I am from Massachusetts, so we talked a
                    lot. I tried to win him over a little bit. He was having a lot of trouble with
                    his consular officer. The dispute, the problems had gotten to the level of the
                    director general. There were major problems with the consular officer reporting
                    to the medical department of State that the ambassador was unfit to serve as
                    ambassador. A lot of things were going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was more personality than...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, I think it was personality. The consular officer was accused of
                    lesbianism. She wanted to adopt some Trinidadian children. She said the
                    Ambassador had let the Trinidadians know of her sexual preferences. It was a
                    mess; believe me it was a mess. To boot, she was a personal friend of my deputy.
                    It was not an easy situation. In any case, one of the problems was that this
                    ambassador was very pigheaded and strong. He had done a lot of good things. He
                    saw the need to interdict drugs coming in, boats that would then go up to the
                    States from Colombia, stopping over in Trinidad and then going up. He had a good
                    sense about the economics of the country. But we had to say in the report that
                    he was making progress, had done a lot of good things here and there, but there
                    were these personnel problems and he had to recognize them. Well, he looked at
                    this report, a team leader has to write a report, an inspection evaluation
                    report on the ambassador and DCM. There was no DCM at that point, so it was on
                    the ambassador that I wrote it. You write it in conjunction with your team, but
                    you deal with the ambassador on it. He looked at this, and he was furious. He
                    said, “I will not sign this. I will not sign this if you put a gun to my head.”
                    Here I was, this was the first one I had ever written. I didn't know what the
                    hell to do. I said, “Okay, if you won't sign it, I will just make a note that
                    you refused to sign it. What else can I do?” That is what happened. I came back
                    to Washington. The OIG officer said, “That's fine.” These reports on political
                    appointees supposedly could go to the White House. It never happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, nobody gives a damn.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. I mean he had talked about the fact that when he came in,
                    he came in from the eastern part of Massachusetts, from the Brockton area. He
                    said he really wanted Ireland as a post to be ambassador. He had been a former
                    Congressman who had been defeated. He said, “Teddy Kennedy called and said, no,
                    Jean Smith has Ireland. You stay out of that.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That of course, was Kennedy's sister.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. So he said that he stayed out of it. In the first
                    inspection there were a couple of other amusing problems. In one of the
                    countries, we had an ambassador who had just left, and a DCM who had just left.
                    They did not get along. They were both career people. It turned out, and I won't
                    use names, it turned out that the ambassador, after he left, he left early. He
                    hadn't brought his wife out with him, because they were having problems. He had
                    been assigned to the office of the inspector general; they like to get
                    ambassadors in that operation. Well, one of the things we quickly discovered was
                    that the DCM, who I won't get into more details, but he bears your last name was
                    not the greatest guy in the world, was not the most honest guy in the world. The
                    ambassador was not getting along. There were shouting matches in the hall. There
                    were major personnel problems, not the least of which were the fact that Foreign
                    Service nationals people in the community knew that the ambassador was fooling
                    around with prostitutes. He had one in particular, I don't know if she was a
                    prostitute, but she was staying at the residence. There were all kinds of
                    problems. He was frequenting bars that the security officer had put off bounds
                    for embassy people and marines. He was using his car to take several of his
                    people around. He had a favorite hotel where he would go if he didn't go to the
                    residence. It was a very delicate situation. We are talking about a country of
                    800,000 people, and the American ambassador in Georgetown stands out. Let's be
                    honest. It was a very difficult situation, and what I had to do because we
                    didn't have a secure line, I had to call the deputy inspector general and say,
                    “Look, I'll explain more when I get back, but this person should not come into
                    the inspector general's office. It would not be good. There are too many
                    problems, and I will explain when I get back,” which I did. I came across my
                    notes the other day listing the points I wanted to make. Ironically the first
                    point that I made was this gentleman represents the President of the United
                    States, and he is known to represent the President of the United States. You
                    cannot have him doing these things. Little did I know that he represented the
                    President a lot more than I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about President Clinton and his impeachment
                        and Monica Lewinski and all that stuff.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. Ironically the very first point that I wanted to make from my
                    talking points with the Inspector General is this man as ambassador represented
                    the President of the United States, and you can't have him doing this. He
                    represented the president literally. As it turned out, he did not come in to the
                    OIG. He was supposed to leave the government, but as those things go, he didn't.
                    He stuck around. Same with an admin officer in Trinidad who was really bad. He
                    was a decent admin officer but he called his local employees monkeys. It was a
                    mess. We had a history of statements from various people of the tensions he had
                    caused. We recommended that he be removed from the service. And indeed that did
                    not happen either because a year ago when I was walking in the Department I saw
                    him walking around the Department. He is still there. It is very frustrating
                    because he certainly should have been, but nobody had the guts to do this. More
                    importantly, before we went out on the inspection, I and the deputy leader
                    talked to the director general, which is where these problems are centered. We
                    talked to the director general because of the problem between the ambassador and
                    the consular officer. When we came back and reported back to the director
                    general about this admin officer, it turned out that he had been admin officer
                    in Latin America at a post where this director general had been ambassador, and
                    the director general knew all about him. He never mentioned it to us in advance.
                    I said, “Why didn't you do something?” “Well there are too many other things to
                    do.” He didn't do anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are pointing to a really frustrating problem. Again
                        and again I have talked to people who have known of Foreign Service
                        Officers, I am talking about professionals, who really are disasters. I
                        mean, either because of their personal conduct or because of their
                        prejudices or even almost criminal activities, sometimes maybe even criminal
                        activity. And yet, the system is not able to pick them up, chew them up, and
                        spit them out. They conceal, and particularly if they happen to call
                        themselves a minority or a gender case, but even on the straight white male
                        type things. I mean if you want to dig your heels in, you can stay, collect
                        the money and be almost untouched.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: That's right. I had a couple of colleagues who did that who should have
                    been out a long time ago, but stayed in. They weren't doing anything. They were
                    stuck way over in the west wing. That is exactly what happens. But in the
                    inspector general's case, he should have told us in advance this guy's problems,
                    and the officer should have been out. Anyway, it didn't happen.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>When I met with the inspector general and some of her staff about this ambassador
                    in Georgetown, I must have gone through three or four talking points. To show
                    you the mentality, somebody on her staff said, “Well you mean he was actually
                    picking this woman up in his ambassadorial car?” “Yes.” “They were sending the
                    car for her?” “Yes.” This gives an idea of the mentality, this person said, “We
                    could get him for misuse of government vehicles.” I said, “No, I am not going to
                    get into that kind of crap.” I mean, we are talking about a much bigger picture
                    than misuse of government vehicles. But I mean it was that kind of mentality. It
                    just floored me. He misused the government vehicle, but a lot of people do. But
                    that wasn't the issue. The issue was broader based issue, and it continues to
                    be.</p>
                <p>We also had a case at one of the posts, probably this first inspection, where we
                    had a DCM who had just left, and she was very good at the consular side of
                    things, and they had a big problem in the consular section, major fraud going
                    on. She didn't pick it up. She didn't supervise it terribly well. We had said
                    this, and she came in and she complained because I had known her personally. I
                    had worked with her. She had complained that it was my deputy that didn't like
                    her, that this was a bad report and was going to ruin her reputation or corrode
                    her reputation. I said, “Well nobody is going to see it. It doesn't really
                    matter.” She cried. She is a good officer, still in the service. You know, she
                    went in and complained to the inspector general and cried. What can I tell you.
                    But the report stood up, and I still talk to her. Nobody really saw it; it
                    doesn't really matter.</p>
                <p>In my next round of inspections, I went off to the Balkans while things were
                    heating up, during the winter so we couldn't be accused of taking a vacation. We
                    were very concerned about safety, but we did it. We did Macedonia, Serbia,
                    Croatia, when things were, well Macedonia hadn't hotted up yet, but it was the
                    last of the former Yugoslav republics to break away. In their main square they
                    still had a statue of Tito up, which was interesting. One of the things we
                    recommended in Macedonia was that the Voice of America stop broadcasting into
                    Macedonia in the Albanian language, or in the alternative start broadcasting
                    into Macedonia in the Macedonian language. This recommendation was made because
                    the foreign minister...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, you were pushing the button with the Greeks, but go
                        ahead.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>WILSON: Well, yes, we know that. In fact it is not Macedonia, it is the FYROM.
                    Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. That is the name that you officially have
                    to call it. But at that time a good friend of mine, Tom Niles, was the
                    ambassador to Greece, so we talked. I was going to go down to see him, but
                    direct air transportation had been cut off. You had to go a roundabout way, and
                    I couldn't do that. There wasn't the time. But in any case, the foreign minister
                    asked the ambassador to stop this broadcasting in Albanian. We put that as part
                    of our recommendation. The reason, of course, the VOA was broadcasting in
                    Albanian was since the start of the Cold War they had an Albanian service, they
                    had Albanian refugees. They didn't have any Macedonian refugees. They were not
                    about to stop. The director of USIA at the time, a guy named Joe Duffy, not
                    among the stronger directors USIA has ever had, in fact probably among the two
                    or three weakest, or weaker, told the inspector general, “I am very glad this
                    recommendation is in. Help me get the Voice to do something; I can never get
                    them to do anything I want them to do,” which is true. It didn't have any effect
                    until believe it or not, last April. Last April because of what was going on,
                    the Voice suddenly instituted a Macedonian service. I would like to think we
                    were responsible for that. I realize that we probably weren't, but it was our
                    recommendation that it be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am surprised, because I am an old Balkan hand going back
                        to the 60's. Usually as soon as you start talking about Macedonian, which is
                        essentially a dialect of Bulgarian, not Serbian, it is a dialect. But this
                        gets very hot. The Greeks go ballistic claiming that there is no such thing
                        as a Macedonian language. I even had a Greek person at their embassy in
                        Belgrade, when I casually mentioned I spoke some Macedonian, told me I was
                        crazy, and he meant it. Was this an example of the Greek lobby being so
                        strong in the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It is only outdone by a couple of other lobbies that are strong, but the
                    Greeks are very strong. In any case, the ambassador, Christopher Hill, was a
                    very strong very good ambassador. He is now back here doing something with that
                    area. Anyway they wanted him to come back and head up one of the parts of the
                    Department that was dealing with this whole Balkan crisis. He did not; he stayed
                    there, and now he is back. He is the one that when Holbrooke was going in and
                    out, he was at Holbrooke's side. Spoke the language. His brother was a political
                    officer in Serbia. His father had been a missionary and had been brought up in
                    the Balkans. Good ambassador. It was one of the better run posts that we had
                    come across. He had a very good sense of feel with the government, with the
                    dissidents. He had some UN, you know the white vehicles running around at the
                    time. You had an American presence, three or four hundred American soldiers
                    rotating in and out from Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at those areas, Macedonia, particularly in this
                        time, how was our embassy, because so many of these things were sort of put
                        in on the cheap and all that? How did you find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>WILSON: It was good. It had moved to a location just outside of town. It was a
                    good embassy that was well run. It was in decent shape. We complained about the
                    fact that USIS had moved out there. They had done that to save money, to move in
                    with the embassy. It was also more protected, but it was also more exclusive and
                    harder for people, Macedonians, to come and go to use the library and things. It
                    was not a good place for USIS. It wasn't a new building, but it was a new
                    embassy, and it was in good shape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about in Croatia? How did you find things there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The embassy was very tight. It was a consulate that had been converted
                    into an embassy, and space was a major problem. But let me get to that later.
                    Serbia was the old embassy in Yugoslavia. A big place. Still, when we were there
                    it was hard to get from one place to the other. You had to walk on the outside.
                    It was kind of disastrous sometimes. It had an extremely strong and good
                    ambassador named Dick Miles, one of the better ambassadors I have encountered.
                    it was his third tour there. He had been there as a JO (junior officer), as
                    something else, now he was back as ambassador. Spoke the language, knew the
                    people. His wife did the same thing. Extremely well run embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There must have been quite a bit of tension wasn't there,
                        because Milosevic, this was really close to the time when they stirred up
                        things in Kosovo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well yes, a little bit before. We had a USIS operation in Kosovo, in
                    Pristina. We had a cultural center which was established under Secretary
                    Christopher without consulting with USIS, but with the support of Milosevic,
                    providing, and this is one of the ironies, providing that the government agreed
                    to reopen its cultural center in the center of Belgrade down near the
                    university. We had closed this because Ann Sigmund didn't think we needed that
                    kind of operation. Milosevic gave us permission to open the center in Pristina
                    on the condition that we reopen this one in Belgrade, and he gave it to us rent
                    free for about three years. It was very nice. We knew how important a post near
                    Pristina would be. Now, one of the problems we ran into of course, was that the
                    PAO in Pristina did not bring his wife, and he took up with an Albanian beauty
                    on the side. That was a slight problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an inspection team, I mean, everybody is getting looser
                        and looser in things, and supposedly what you do on the side is not
                        important, but this obviously is. I mean how did you view something like
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>WILSON: We did not put anything in the inspection report. He was not doing
                    anything that seemed to violate security. That is all I can say. We didn't
                    mention anything about it. It was generally known, I mean, this woman was at
                    diners with the Ambassador when he came down to Pristina. He was married back
                    home; that was known. I mean, she was supposedly his language teacher. All
                    right. What can I tell you; she taught a lot of languages. But one of the things
                    we were concerned about, we wanted to get a secure phone link between the
                    embassy in Belgrade and the USIS operation in Pristina. We ran into enormous
                    opposition both from the security people in the embassy because of cost and from
                    USIS saying that we don't deal with secure phone lines on our premises, and we
                    don't accept that, which is a dumb position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, sort of like the extra pure, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, we had a report, we put it in the central part of the report. After
                    about four months, USIS caved in and said we could do it. It took the State
                    Department another seven months to come up with the funding to put it in, saying
                    it is not going to be secure. It could be compromised. Yes, it could be, but at
                    least get something. Otherwise the only way you could communicate was to drive
                    four hours from Pristina to Belgrade. Anyway, that was a little triumph we had.
                    It took a while for it to materialize, but it did materialize.</p>
                <p>The ambassador was very close to many members of the opposition. He had his
                    problems with Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Milosevic's wife, and two other people who
                    were really running the country. We found there was a difficulty in reporting.
                    They weren't coordinating and they weren't talking to each other in who was
                    getting which stuff. It was a bit of a problem. I assume it is overcome by
                    events; I don't know. Let's get into Croatia first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wait a minute, let's, before we leave Belgrade, was it a
                        hostile situation there? I mean this is the time I guess when the students,
                        there were demonstrations against Milosevic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, there were. In fact, I walked alongside a couple of them. I was
                    careful. I probably shouldn't have, but I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would think you would have sort of a two faced
                        embassy, an embassy where government facilities were really sort of closed
                        to them, but at the same time you had certainly some of the intellectual
                        side and the opposition falling all over themselves to keep in touch with
                        the embassy. How would you define it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>WILSON: Well, yes, that was true. It was a dichotomous situation. The ambassador
                    dealt with Milosevic, very harshly at times. He told him certain things that he
                    wanted. To save time if the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, sent him a
                    message the ambassador considered too harsh for purposes, he wouldn't hesitate
                    to go back and tell her this. That was part of the coordination that I did not
                    like or we did not like. When they were drafting stuff, the position to send to
                    Milosevic, they didn't consult the embassy. They presented the embassy with a
                    fait accompli. Wrong! I mean the ambassador had the courage to go back and say
                    this shouldn't be done. He was told go back and do it. He did it. But the
                    embassy was not consulted in development of a position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well in talking about this, I mean, this is an era that I
                        am not too familiar with. I am told that by this time the E-mail process had
                        sort of really taken over so there could be what amounts to quite a bit of
                        consultation. They were planning to send you the following instructions.
                        What do you think before they come up, or had this arrived at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No not at all. No there was no consultation in any way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But was this happening in other places?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No. In fact as far as I was concerned in '97, in the winter and spring of
                    '97, no. I did not see this at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you finding in, I mean, from your glimpse of the
                        foreign policy apparatus, this obviously was a key place at the time, that
                        policy was, you know, instructions and all this were sort of being issued
                        sort of at the Secretary of State level without really bringing in the
                        experts? I mean, this is more sort of the Washington operators who want to
                        look like they are being tough.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes. I mean there were a couple of people, Bob whatever his name was,
                    they were consulted. But the desk people and the country directors were not
                    really involved. As I said, the ambassador certainly was not consulted in the
                    making of policy. That bothered us. We said so. It didn't matter, but we said
                    so. That was about it in Serbia. There were not a large number of American
                    journalists there yet because things really hadn't heated up. In Croatia, we had
                    a lot of trouble because we couldn't fly directly from Serbia to Croatia. You
                    had to go up by Europe and come back. I don't know if that has changed. The
                    ambassador to Croatia at the time was a former democratic staffer on the foreign
                    relations committee named Peter Galbraith. He was both hated and more hated by
                    the professionals. I got along with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am interviewing him. He is away now. He is off on OSC
                        something somewhere, but he is coming back, and so I will continue
                        interviewing him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well if you do talk to him, give him my best. I got along well with
                    Peter. He did not refuse to sign his efficiency rating. He was very good about
                    it. He was not nearly so harsh as his reputation, which preceded him, was. And I
                    know from dealing with the deputy director's office in USIA, he was the nemesis
                    of USIA on the Hill. On the other hand, when he was out there as ambassador, he
                    was probably the strongest supporter of public diplomacy, public affairs, that I
                    have ever seen. In fact, when as I mentioned, the embassy was in an old
                    consulate building, there were a lot of space problems, they were remodeling,
                    etc., and my two admin people in their draft recommendation recommended that the
                    USIS library was too big and the USIS space was too much and should be cut back
                    by almost 50%. The ambassador said, “No way, if anything it should be enlarged.”
                    Of course, being a team leader I could do anything I wanted, and we did not put
                    that recommendation in. On the contrary, we needed to put in a recommendation
                    for larger space when we got back. But Peter truly liked what public diplomacy
                    was doing, and in fact he put the public affairs officer who was a good officer
                    on his special working team along with the number two political officer and
                    somebody else in the consular section who were his favorites. They really
                    developed policy. There were major problems, as you probably have heard, between
                    the ambassador, Peter Galbraith, and the CIA station. Major problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the issues? Can you talk about them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It is hard to get into, but there were major problems. I mean the
                    director of the agency came out. That is how bad it was. On the inspection side,
                    our deputy inspector general who was in charge of relations with the CIA, a guy
                    named John Wyatt, came out. It was a severe situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I know there were newspaper articles about shipments
                        of arms and things of this nature that, I mean, there was great debate. I am
                        not sure it continues because the focus has shifted.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The station chief sent an individual to the States on some programs,
                    didn't tell the ambassador. Various things of that kind. I mean, just getting
                    the station chief and the ambassador to talk to each other was a major
                    accomplishment. When we left, we thought we had accomplished that, and we really
                    had, but then within three months the thing went sour again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tudjman was considered, along with Milosevic, those were
                        the two key players in causing the disaster that Yugoslav internal policy
                        caused, I mean maybe not caused the split up, but made it as appalling as it
                        was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>WILSON: Well, it was, but Tudjman was very needed by us in the whole Bosnian
                    affair in Bosnia, so we were treating him very well. There was a couple of areas
                    in dispute. Ambassador Galbraith showed a lot of political courage physically
                    going out there and telling the Croatians they had to accept the Serbs in this
                    situation. There was a time when the Croatians were fooling around with Serb
                    tractors, and the ambassador was on one of the tractors. He dragged me and one
                    of my team mates out there. It was a pretty hairy situation. I have a picture of
                    myself in a Ukrainian helicopter in the middle of a thunderstorm. We did it. I
                    am glad I am back here to talk to you. He showed good political courage and
                    physical courage. We were very impressed with him. But I don't really want to
                    get into the problems between the ambassador and CIA station.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he get along? He is obviously an activist. I had
                        only covered the senatorial side when he was having a wonderful time sort of
                        making policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, screwing everybody up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes. But how did he get along with some of the State
                        Department Foreign Service side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Well he calmed down a lot. He got married. It was his second or third
                    wife. They had a child. He took on a different persona from the Peter that was
                    here on the hill. He and I had a close mutual friend, maybe that helped me get
                    along with him. But I truly liked him a lot. I mean it was a very jaundiced view
                    of when he was up on the Hill and I was in the deputy director's office. But
                    seeing him in action and working with him for 21/2 or 3 weeks on the inspection,
                    I respect him. I respected his political judgment. I respect his courage,
                    physical courage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the relations with State Department,
                        instructions and all this? This was a tricky time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We discussed that, Peter and I, and he said that he never flaunted
                    instructions, that he followed them. He may follow them in his own way but he
                    followed them. He did not flaunt them; he did not burn them. He did not say that
                    he just paid no attention to them. What he did say though, was very interesting.
                    He said often he found a vacuum in policy, and he, Peter Galbraith the
                    ambassador, did not hesitate to fill that vacuum. I respected that; he did a
                    good job. I know there was a policy vacuum at least out of the Department that
                    was very hard. So I mean he followed the instructions. He did not flaunt them.
                    He saw a vacuum, and he filled it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and then you don't report back. You just do what you
                        feel you need. You don't ask for advice at a certain point.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>WILSON: He filled the vacuum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Then when you came back, how did you feel, who was
                        the inspector general, and how did you feel, I think it was a woman. How did
                        you feel she dealt with her teams and the recommendations and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: There is a big long process in the inspector's office. It is changing
                    now. They have made a whole new setup which I consider grossly ineffective. I
                    won't get into that because it is not my business anymore. But she handled it
                    well. It was very bureaucratic. It would take months, four or five months for an
                    inspection report to get all the clearances and get out. What else can I say.
                    I'll give you a better example. When I also inspected Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right let's talk about Korea.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>WILSON: Korea, I had a new deputy, a man named Dick Tierney who was a former
                    Foreign Service Officer who was very good. Extraordinarily good. Very competent
                    at using computers. One of the things that both Dick and I pride ourselves on
                    was that even though the Korean inspection was very important, it was a big
                    post, we were determined to keep the inspection report under 50 pages. That was
                    a major job, and we did it. Our other posts that were small, the inspection
                    report was easy to keep under 50 pages. But many of the inspection reports go on
                    and on with irrelevancies. I mean, nobody pays any attention to them. I mean,
                    you read the “key” findings, and that is a word I told you I hate in government.
                    I never use it because ever since my fourth or fifth year in government, those
                    things that are important are considered “key,” key contacts, key ideas, key
                    findings. They have got to be a little bit more something than the word key. In
                    any case, we kept our Korea inspection report under 50 pages. That was a
                    deliberate decision, and we did it. Dick Tierney was very good. We added a
                    second admin inspector, that was fairly important in a place like Korea. We had
                    a charg�, not an ambassador. The political ambassador had left a charg� who was
                    in charge, Dick, his name escapes me. This raised a very interesting point. He
                    had been in Korea in the Peace Corps. He had, if you count the Peace Corps, this
                    was his fourth tour in Korea. He knew the language; he knew what was going on.
                    He knew the people. He knew the head of the Korea CIA. He knew the President. He
                    knew the people personally. They had known him from way back. Very important.
                    One of the problems that we cited in our report was what should the Department
                    do about a post like Thailand or Korea or China, or Russia for that matter,
                    where you have a vast cultural difference from the United States and language
                    difficulties, and language barriers. Should someone specialize in this as a
                    career and stay specialized in that with occasionally, very occasionally, be
                    moved into something else, or does this make the person too “pro” the country in
                    which they are specializing, and therefore their advice becomes suspect? It is a
                    very good question. There is no right or wrong answer. You don't know how to
                    deal with it. The Department, from a personnel perspective, isn't going to
                    really put people specializing in Korea, we are going to promote you because you
                    know the language and you have done a very good job. You know the people; your
                    advice is important. Their advice is important, but automatically the policy
                    makers and political people, if they see this guy has specialized in Korea for
                    18 years, think, well, you know, he is leaning too much toward the Koreans. It
                    is a problem, how you deal with it, I don't know. You also have a situation the
                    reverse of this, because of internal politics within the Department, they named
                    as head of the political section a person who had no Korean experience at all,
                    no Korean language. Because they had to do something with him, they gave him two
                    years in Korea. He was not very good. I mean good officer but he couldn't deal
                    with the subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Korean is, it ranks up among the top two or three of the
                        most difficult languages.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because, I mean, there are all sorts of qualifiers and all
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>WILSON: He couldn't really deal with the situation. That's ironic. Well, in any
                    case these are issues where there is no answer, no right or wrong answer. You
                    just have to see where you are going. The PAO in Korea, had also been in the
                    Peace Corps. This was only his third tour, but he and the charg� were effective,
                    because they knew the people, they knew the country, they knew the language. Did
                    they go too far overboard? I don't know. One of the things the charg�, and I
                    strongly agreed on, Christianson was his name, we agreed on the importance in an
                    embassy of telephone operators, human beings. One of the real complaints I had
                    when I was in Brussels was that the admin office for all the three missions in
                    Brussels went to an automatic telephone answering system, which is frustrating
                    as hell in a place like Belgium because you had to have everything in English,
                    French, and Dutch. That wasn't so great. By the time you connected with a
                    person, if you are calling from long distance, it has already taken you two or
                    three minutes. In Korea they maintained a rank of Korean-English speaking
                    telephone operators who were smart enough and well paid enough to know where to
                    direct your call, to whom to direct your call. One of the strong recommendations
                    we made is they should keep this type of operation going, not try to automate
                    the phone system because the phone people are the first contact with your host
                    country. Very important. His name was Dick Christianson, the charg�. He agreed
                    with me totally on that. We cited keeping this in our report on best practices,
                    in spite of strong pressure form the Department to cut costs. We said you could
                    cut costs in other places. We had a major consular problem in the operation. It
                    stemmed from a group of former USIA people who were brought into the State
                    Department because they might have been ousted from USIA. We ran into one of
                    these guys in the consular section, and he was a real screw-up. I mean he truly
                    was. It was bad. One of the things that had happened was they had lost 10,000
                    visa forms. A big deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely because these validate a visa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: On the black market in the Far East these things would be worth a lot of
                    money. We figured they would be worth at least $100,000-$200,000, at least. My
                    consular inspector found that what had happened. They had one box, and there
                    were supposedly four other boxes missing. We didn't know where they were. This
                    guy in the consular section didn't pay any attention. The consul general, who
                    was a favorite of the head of the consular section in the Department, so no one
                    was going to say anything against her, and she later got an ambassadorship, let
                    this roll off her back. She was responsible for it. No one was going to say, she
                    was good, she should have been responsible for this. In any case, my consular
                    inspectors discovered that Seoul is right near Santiago in the mail pigeonhole
                    setup in the department. Four of these visa form boxes were placed in the
                    Santiago...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh you mean just how things are sent.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>WILSON: Yes, and Santiago got these things. They realized it wasn't for them.
                    They sent E-mails to the Department and to Seoul. Nobody paid any attention to
                    them. So for months these missing visa forms are sitting in Santiago. Santiago
                    didn't care. When we got there and started pushing, somebody found the E-mail
                    that was sent. Maybe it was a telegram, I don't remember. It might have been a
                    telegram because it went to both Seoul and Washington. We found them, and they
                    took care of it. That was extraordinarily lax administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, on the part of the consular section. How about
                        fraud? Were you looking for fraud or malfeasance or the like in Seoul in the
                        consular operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: Not really, but in another section we were. One of the problems in the
                    consular section was that most of the consular officers are first tour, maybe
                    second, didn't speak the language, so they needed an Korean interpreter. They
                    had maybe 30-40 seconds to make a decision in a case. The ambassador set up a
                    system whereby if there were political issues involved it would be cleared
                    through the political section. This caused some problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am grimacing at that because I was consul general in
                        Seoul back '76-'79. It is not a good idea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: No, and this caused some other problems. But on the other hand, when the
                    son of the minister of justice wants to go over to the United States as a
                    tourist, he had the bank account etc., but he is turned down, I mean...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you have got to have a way of looking at it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: We said there should be no special considerations. Obviously there is
                    always the exception here, the exception there. But the consular section is one
                    of the more important sections of any embassy because you have contact with the
                    Foreign Service host country nationals. You have got to deal with them properly.
                    We had problems with visa lines in the Caribbean. You just can't leave people
                    out standing around. You have got to pay attention to their needs. You have got
                    to pay attention to the public relations aspect. In Korea they had visa lines.
                    There were often press stories on the length of the visa lines, etc. The
                    consular section was responsible for the emergency evacuation plan and the
                    coordination with DOD. That needed a lot of...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it is a real threat because something could

                <p>WILSON: They needed a lot of pulling up of the socks on that one, how that was
                    going to go. But the more interesting situation developed just a couple of days
                    before we left. One of our admin inspectors received a tip. He was told that the
                    commissary - there was an embassy commissary, and you had four classic liquor
                    stores on base. You had 37,000 military stationed there close around Seoul. Some
                    were in; some not. The embassy commissary could not account for a shipment of
                    1,200 cases of Mogen David wine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is not exactly a best seller on the open market I
                        don't think.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>WILSON: Well, the Koreans apparently like sweet wines, and this is considered an
                    elixir. There were four black market rings operating out of the commissary,
                    usually the wives of military who had relatives off in the boondocks. They were
                    forced into this. They did a lot of stuff. One of the first indications we had
                    was in our admin inspection, when one of our admin people, our chief admin
                    officer, who is really superb, he is still working, a guy named Allan Barenson,
                    really good. He learned that the tip box, at the checkout of the commissary
                    there is a tip box, that the tip box was pulling in about $3,000 to $5,000 a
                    month in tips. Okay, well, it gives you some idea of what is going on. In any
                    case, we got back to Washington. There was a flurry of E-mails. After about a
                    week or ten days, we got an E-mail, a very proud E-mail saying we have located
                    the missing 1,200 cases, and only two cases were broken, and you will be pleased
                    to know that from the time we put this on the shelf in the first week, 700 cases
                    were sold. Isn't that interesting. We turned this over to the investigators.
                    They weren't really interested in this. They did a little bit of investigating.
                    They called the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. We learned through
                    them, through our investigators in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
                    that from a little place in California called Ripon, California, that between
                    January of 1997 and July of 1997, there had been shipped to the embassy in
                    Seoul, Korea 150,000 bottles of Mogen David wine. 150,000 bottles! It may have
                    been closer to 145,000 but it was X number of cases times four or five
                    shipments, a shipment varying between 1,000 and 1,200 cases in a shipment. I
                    said, even at Passover time in the Catskills, you are not going to consume that
                    much Mogen David wine. One of the little ironies was the admin inspector who had
                    first discovered this, was leaving our team once he got back to Washington. I
                    did give her a little going away party. I went to find some Mogen David wine. I
                    couldn't find any. I finally found some way out in Silver Springs somewhere.
                    Obviously I couldn't find it; it was all in Korea. I am sure they had it
                    somewhere else. You know, I asked our investigators, I said, “You know, this is
                    probably the tip of the iceberg. There is probably a lot of alcohol going the
                    same route.” They had other things to worry about. They never worried about it,
                    but it was rather amusing, 150,000 bottles of Mogen David wine in a six month
                    period shipped to the embassy in Seoul. Obviously some American GSO or assistant
                    GSO, somebody had signed for the damn thing. Somebody had to know it was going
                    in. It wasn't just the head of the commissary who was the problem, and he was.
                    He had the problem you see, he had been in several commissary jobs in southeast
                    Asia. He had been fired. He gets picked up. No one wanted to have any trouble,
                    so they kept him on. You know it is the same thing you were talking about with
                    Foreign Service Officers in some of these cases, that is the problem. We didn't
                    do much else about it. It was an amusing situation. It makes for good
                    conversation now. A lot of Mogen David wine. The inspection in Korea found very
                    solid political economic reporting, the consular section, the consul general was
                    named Dee Robinson. She is very well respected. She is ambassador to Ghana now.
                    She was very good. There was a guy there, a deputy in something else, who was
                    not that good, but Dee was a good friend of the head of the consular office
                    here. What the hell is her name?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mary Ryan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>WILSON: Mary Ryan. Of course we met with Mary when we came back. My big brave
                    consular officers in our discussions with Mary, not once did they say one thing
                    negative about Dee Robinson. They said several negative things about two other
                    people in the operation. But when we came out of the meeting with Mary, this was
                    the third or fourth time I had met with her because we did this each time we
                    came back. I said to my two guys, “Why didn't you tell her what you found?” They
                    said, “Well, because we are consular officers. We want an assignment overseas.
                    We know how she feels about the consul general. We are not going to blot our
                    copy books with Mary.” That is the way things go, unfortunately. I mean they
                    weren't serious things, but Dee wasn't the paragon of efficiency and virtue that
                    people thought, no one is that good. She is good, she is excellent, but my guys
                    decided to put the onus of problems on two others. One of them was really bad.
                    He was leaving the consular service anyway, so it really didn't matter. But
                    those things happen.</p>
                <p>The one good thing that came out of the, not good thing, the one thing that came
                    out of the Korean inspection was that our team had nothing to do, nothing going
                    on in early fall. I was there in Washington, and I was determined to get the
                    inspection report out in a timely manner. Because I was there, I could walk
                    things around from office to office. I could call people. I could come over to
                    the State. My goal was to get the inspection report out in final form in a
                    month. I missed that goal. I got it out in six weeks, but that was considered
                    remarkable. It shouldn't be. It should be considered standard. The only reason
                    that this happened was I was physically there, and I could be persuasive. A
                    fellow just wants to get me out of their damn office. I was forceful, and one of
                    the recommendations that I made, not in the inspection report but to the
                    inspector general, and again it wasn't carried out, is that a member of the
                    incoming inspection team, a fairly senior member should stay behind if that team
                    goes out again, to shepherd the progress of the inspection report through the
                    bureaucracy to get it out before it becomes ancient history. That is very
                    important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well was this about the end would you say of the Seoul
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: It was because I ended up in the late fall, early winter breaking my hip,
                    and I wasn't going to go very many places. I stayed around, did a few things.
                    They came up with some bureaucratic exercise, not just for me but for the whole
                    inspector general's office. They were going to reform it. They set up a team. It
                    was ridiculous. Nobody has ever, you know, for four or five months everybody is
                    writing these reports, paying attention, taking notes, having meetings two or
                    three times a week. Nothing ever happened. They had meetings in Baltimore and
                    meetings out at the Wye Plantation, a lot of different things. Nothing every
                    happened. Then I retired in the fall of '98.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what have you been involved with since you have
                        retired?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>WILSON: Well, at one point I came back in to help the Kosovo task force because I
                    knew some of the people who were on it, some of my inspection team. To be
                    honest, I spent about three or four days doing it and I found I didn't have to
                    work. I did not believe in the way they were conducting things. I got out of it.
                    You know, after the bombing of the Chinese embassy, there was a big flurry about
                    what kind of map did you have. The deputy, the DCM in Belgrade, was there
                    working. I had known him because we had inspected him. He had come back, and his
                    driver had come back with him. He got a visa for his driver who was living in
                    the States somewhere around here. The DOD called over and said, “Do you know
                    anybody, who could help us out with a downtown map of Belgrade?” This guy said,
                    “Well I can't, but my former driver is here, and he knows it very well, because
                    I never paid attention to where we were going.” They said, “Oh, but he is not an
                    American citizen. We can't deal with him.” About two days later they called back
                    and asked, “Could we come over and talk with him, we really need to know where
                    certain things are.” I did some work for the new ECA bureau in the State
                    Department. I came back as a consultant.</p>
                <p>I don't know if I got into the visa waiver group. I assume I did when I was
                    talking about, I hope I did. But I was chairman of the J visa waiver review
                    committee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is exchange students.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILSON: The J visa, educational exchange visas. When they come over and they want
                    to stay, to forsake the terms of their visa, the case would come before the J
                    visa waiver review committee, and we have to make a decision. I was chairman of
                    that for about three years. A very interesting job, but one of the things they
                    do is to come back and now that they are moving over to State, to look at not
                    only the J visa review side but the J visa designation side, which was formerly
                    controlled by the office of general counsel in USIA. There was a lot of problems
                    with the exchange organizations in that in doing that, and we found out the J
                    visa designation unit was peopled by about seven or eight women who were there,
                    two of whom and come over because they were doing film reviews. There was a
                    downsizing and they had to merge. They merged the film reviews with the J visa
                    designation unit. It was a very ineffective operation. I agreed to do this, the
                    study would not last longer than a month. It wouldn't be agonizing. We would do
                    a short report, which we did. Some of the reforms that we suggested were good. I
                    then talked to someone in the consular section in the State Department because
                    they then divided up the J visa review, the J visa designation, and the waiver
                    review group was taken over by a lady in the State Department whose husband is
                    Marc Grossman, Mildred Patterson. I helped out on how things could go. I worked
                    with her a bit. I have gone back a couple of times on occasional visits to help
                    the ECA bureau on the annual report. At the moment I am awaiting a call from the
                    FOI office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Freedom of information.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>WILSON: Freedom of information. They sent me a request back in May asking if I
                    would come and do FOI. I filled out the papers. I didn't hear and didn't hear.
                    Finally in September I called, “Oh yes we are working on that Mr. Wilson.” In
                    November, “Yes you are among the people who have been selected. A lot depends on
                    money and budgets and things like this.” I haven't heard more from them in
                    January and February. I am still waiting to hear. I have all the clearances I
                    need because I continue to keep the clearances that I had. Getting someone to
                    call me back is very difficult, getting a particular individual to call me back,
                    and I won't get into names. One of my philosophies when I was working in the
                    Department was I returned every phone call every day. Occasionally you couldn't
                    do that, but at the very least you returned their phone calls.</p>
                <p>I think a good Foreign Service Officer, in my view, has to be willing to accept
                    responsibility for his or her actions, and to make decisions that may or may not
                    be popular, not just to go along with the crowd or to bury yourself in the
                    bureaucracy and say, well, it is policy that we do this. Dammit, we as
                    individuals make that policy, and don't hide behind it. Often in the Foreign
                    Service, we just are content to write reports and sit back and do nothing else.
                    Just write reports. Well, it is the bureaucracy. That is how things do or don't
                    get done. I think, if you want to move ahead in the Foreign Service,
                    particularly now in the 21st century, you need to be able to have the courage.
                    You need to have courage, you need to have good common sense, good common sense
                    judgment, and take responsibility. Very important in the Foreign Service.</p>

                <p>WILSON: The other thing beside responsibility and working with the bureaucracy to
                    do your will, not hiding behind it or hiding in it is you have got to care. A
                    Foreign Service Officer has got to give a damn. Very important, care about what
                    you do, care about your work, be involved.</p>
