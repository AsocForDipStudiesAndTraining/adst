                <p>Interviewed by: Arthur Tienken </p>

                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I will be having the privilege of interviewing Ambassador
                        Sheldon Vance, who was twice ambassador, once to Chad and once to Zaire.
                        Ambassador Vance, you entered the Foreign Service in 1942. Could you tell us
                        what about the Foreign Service interested you enough to make it a
                        career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I attended Carlton College in Northfield, Minnesota, from 1935 to 1939.
                    Shortly before I went to Carlton, Frank Kellogg, former Secretary of State, and
                    a Minnesotan, died and left a large part of his fortune to Carlton to establish
                    the Kellogg Foundation for the Study of International Relations. I did not major
                    in that department, but I took many courses and became very interested in
                    foreign affairs. Indeed, I wrote a weekly column for the Carltonian, the college
                    newspaper, on foreign affairs.</p>
                <p>In 1939, my mother and I went on a trip to Europe, which sometimes followed a
                    college graduation, and we visited most of the countries of Western Europe,
                    including then Nazi Germany. I happened to be in Nuremberg, attended the last
                    Nazi Congress in Nuremberg. We were in Naples when I read of the Hitler-Stalin
                    Pact, and I told my mother, “We'd better get out of Mussolini's Italy fast.” So
                    we did, and we were in Nice, France, when Britain and France went to war with
                    Germany, and were evacuated. We went home on a ship sent to a little fishing
                    port near Bordeaux. So that sort of initiated me into foreign affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Having entered the Foreign Service, you spent a fair
                        amount of your career involved in what was then the Belgian Congo, later
                        Zaire. You first presumably were initiated to Congolese affairs when you
                        became country desk officer for Belgium in 1951. Was there much interest at
                        that time in the then Congo in the Department of State?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>VANCE: Not a great deal, but the fact that the Congo was a very huge country and
                    enormously rich potentially in raw materials interested it mightily to form
                    Belgium to the Belgians. Therefore, I began to learn something about the Congo,
                    although the affairs of the colonies in Africa were then handled by the Bureau
                    of Middle East, South Asian, and African Affairs, rather than the Bureau of
                    European Affairs, where I was. But nonetheless, I began to be exposed to it.</p>
                <p>Then having been transferred from Washington to Brussels, where I became chief of
                    the political section in 1954, I had that position from 1954 to 1958. In the
                    very beginning of 1958, I visited the Belgian Congo and Rwanda and Burundi as
                    the aide and translator and advisor to our then ambassador to Belgium, Clifford
                    Folger. We spent five weeks touring the three colonies. That resulted in my
                    really being bitten by the Africanist bug. I was fascinated by what I saw.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your chief impressions during that visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: There was a very paternalistic policy on the part of the Belgians. The
                    then Governor General briefed the ambassador and me when we arrived in
                    Leopoldville the very first days of January 1958. He explained to us that the
                    Belgian policy was that they were going to wait to give self-government to the
                    Congolese until they had educated a very large percentage of the population, in
                    order, said he, to avoid the mistake that had been made, in their opinion, by
                    the British and the French and the Portuguese, who had educated a small elite,
                    then at independence, which had already begun in the early sixties, a
                    dictatorship of the small elite. They were going to avoid that. So here he was
                    talking to us in January 1958, and saying that Belgium would be there as the
                    colonial power for a number of years.</p>
                <p>They had just had the first very minor elections about a month before we arrived,
                    in about eight or ten communes or sections of major cities. A gentleman by the
                    name of [Joseph] Kasavubu had been elected burgermeister of one of the communes.
                    When I discovered that the Belgian hosts did not intend for the ambassador to
                    meet any Congolese, I advised the ambassador, and he insisted that he meet the
                    elected burgermeisters of the Leopoldville area. I therefore met the gentleman
                    who later became the first president of the Congo, Mr. Kasavubu. That was the
                    last encounter that the ambassador or I had with the Congolese, other than as
                    servants, during the remaining five weeks of our visit.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your time both as desk officer in Washington and your
                        position as chief of the political section in the embassy at Brussels
                        spanned a period of time when U.S. policy towards evolving Africa was being
                        developed. One of the things that a great deal was made of was the fact that
                        the United States had not been a colonial power, as opposed to European
                        countries. At what point in time did you begin to detect a definite
                        individual policy on the part of the United States towards the evolving
                        African countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: It was developing very slowly. I think one of the reasons was that we had
                    a relatively small number of Foreign Service officers stationed in colonial
                    Africa, and also Africa was part of the Middle East and South Asian bureau.
                    That, I think, tended to give a lower priority, I believe, in the minds of
                    senior officials in our government because of the tinderbox type of situation
                    that has been in the Middle East for many years. I didn't detect a great deal of
                    interest in what Ambassador Folger and I had seen and learned in the Congo on
                    the part of the Department of State after we returned to Brussels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a school of thought, if I remember correctly, at
                        that time that the United States tended to support the European colonial
                        powers as a general thesis. Would you call that valid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I believe there was a certain amount of validity to it. I think the United
                    States was in favor of stability and careful transition so that wild-eyed
                    revolutionaries, communists, would not ensconce themselves in the former African
                    colonies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After Brussels, you came back to the Department in a
                        personnel job, and therefore you were not immediately involved in the
                        independence of Zaire. But you certainly inherited it in your first job,
                        after Zaire became independent, as Director of the Office of Central African
                        Affairs. When you became Director of the Office of Central African Affairs,
                        did you inherit a policy? Did you begin to develop a policy? Can you tell us
                        a little bit about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: It was during my service in personnel when the African Bureau became
                    independent, although during the remainder of my service in personnel, I
                    continued to handle African assignments, although the African Bureau had become
                    independent.</p>
                <p>I then moved from personnel to be a student at the Foreign Service Institute in
                    Senior Seminar, and this was from September of 1960 to right after the
                    independence of the Congo on June 30, 1960, until the following May or June, a
                    nine-month academic-type assignment. In that seminar, it was then policy—and I
                    believe still is—for the 25 or 30 students from the full variety of U.S. federal
                    government agencies which deal in foreign affairs, to choose a subject for a
                    research paper. They were asked to choose a subject on a part of the world they
                    had not previously been exposed to.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I was giving some thought, around the first of December of 1960, to choosing a
                    subject related to Asia, when I had two popped discs and underwent major
                    surgery, and was forbidden to envisage any world travels. Therefore, I tried to
                    choose something that I had some background in, so that I wouldn't be totally
                    without firsthand experience in the area that I chose, but one where I had not
                    actually been assigned.</p>
                <p>I chose the newly independent Congo, which, two or three weeks after its
                    independence, had fallen completely apart largely due to the Belgian policy of
                    not giving education to the Congolese. We estimated at the time that there were
                    about 16 million Congolese, and that there were about 12 Congolese university
                    graduates and 2,000 or 3,000 high school graduates.</p>
                <p>Another part of Belgian policy prior to about 1959 was that they did not allow
                    Congolese to occupy positions of officer equivalence, not only in the armed
                    services and policy, but in private sector. The most that a Congolese could rise
                    to in, for example, the mining operations, was to run a locomotive on the
                    railroads or a steam shovel.</p>
                <p>Therefore, when independence came, all of the officers in the Congolese Army were
                    Belgian, and the soldiers could not understand why, after independence, they had
                    to continue to take orders from the Belgians. So the Congolese Army revolted two
                    or three weeks after independence, and very shortly after that, the then
                    Governor of Katanga Province, where all the copper and cobalt mines are located,
                    declared that he had seceded from this disaster up in Leopoldville, and he was
                    aided and abetted by the then Congolese mining company, the Union Miniere [de
                    Haut Katanga], and the same thing happened in Kasai, where the sister company,
                    MIBA, helped the then head of the Kasai Baluba tribe, the M(inaubdible), or the
                    emperor of the Kasai tribal peoples, to secede also, because there were diamond
                    minds. So the two provinces that produced all of the foreign exchange earnings
                    of the Congo had seceded.</p>
                <p>During the course of that year, that first 12 months while I was in the Senior
                    Seminar, the central government fell apart. Kasabuvu had been elected president
                    and [Patrice] Lumumba had been elected the prime minister. The two of them had
                    had a falling-out, each firing the other, and Lumumba was accused of being a
                    communist leader and was finally arrested on Kasabuvu's orders by
                    [Joseph-D�sir�] Mobutu, who had been a sergeant in the Congolese Colonial Army,
                    had been promoted to colonel and commander-in-chief of the Congolese Army by
                    Kasabuvu.</p>
                <p>There Lumumba had his hands, and he wondered where it would be safe to put him in
                    prison. He and the president decided that it would be safer to ship him off to
                    safekeeping in Katanga at the hands of [Moise] Tshombe, who certainly did not
                    like communists or Lumumba. They shipped him off there. Tshombe either
                    personally executed him or had him executed.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>But Lumumba's number two, Gazinga, had managed to escape Mobutu, and made it to
                    Stanleyville, where he declared that he, being the vice prime minister chosen by
                    the Parliament after Lumumba's death, had become the prime minister and the
                    legitimate governor of the Congo.</p>
                <p>So we had two central governments of a country, its two provinces that supplied
                    all of the foreign exchange earnings of the country having seceded. So I had a
                    lot of interesting problems to write about. I went over to the new African
                    Bureau, which had just been headed, under President Kennedy, by former Governor
                    of Michigan, “Soapy” Williams, and “Soapy” was not very well acquainted with
                    Africa, to put it mildly, and brought in Wayne Fredericks, who had been the Ford
                    Foundation man in charge of their African efforts. Wayne Fredericks was the
                    number two.</p>
                <p>I spent a great deal of time over in the African Bureau talking to officers who
                    had been following the Congo and developments in great detail, because I was not
                    able to travel out there for medical reasons. I wrote my paper with their help,
                    first analyzing the background of what had happened, and then suggesting what
                    the United States should try to do to resolve the problems of this disaster. As
                    I say, to a considerable extent it was a product of the officers in the bureau
                    who had been working on the Congo, but also my own thoughts.</p>
                <p>In summary, it was that we should do our best to restore the Congo to its
                    original hold, and the means to that end would be to reassemble the Parliament
                    that had been dissolved when Lumumba and Kasavubu each dismissed the other. Then
                    Kasavubu dismissed the Parliament. We should also endeavor to persuade Tshombe
                    and the Kasai leader to stop this secession and return to the central government
                    if we could get Gazinga to back off.</p>
                <p>Also in view of the fact that there had been a total disintegration of government
                    and law and order, we recommended that the United Nations be asked to supply
                    experts to assist the Congolese in running their government and provide troops
                    from countries other than major powers to provide law and order.</p>
                <p>Governor “Soapy” Williams thought our paper was so good, he asked if I would come
                    to the bureau after graduation from the Senior Seminar, and he would create an
                    office, the Office of Central African Affairs, charged with only trying to cope
                    with the Congo and the two adjacent Belgian colonies, which were about to become
                    independent, Rwanda and Burundi. That launched me in African affairs.</p>
                <p>We did our best to persuade the Kasai leader and Tshombe to abandon their
                    secession and to send their representatives to Parliament, which was reconvened.
                    The U.N. send troops which were spread pretty much all over the Congo, and the
                    U.N. offered, when Kasavubu recalled Parliament, to guarantee the safety of all
                    the members of Parliament, and even to send aircraft out to bring them into
                    Leopoldville.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>The Parliament was finally reassembled at Louvanium University, which had been
                    opened by the Belgian Government only about two years before, as an offshoot of
                    the great Belgium ancient University of Louvain. Louvanium was located on a rise
                    of land above the Congo River at the outskirts of Leopoldville, and the U.N.
                    provided a full battalion of Nigerian troops, in which all sides appeared to
                    have confidence to assure their safety while they were meeting there. Bob
                    Eisenberg, who had been in the bureau before the creation of AFC, had been
                    working on Congo affairs, had become my deputy, and we sent Bob out to
                    �lisabethville to try to persuade Tshombe to send his representatives to
                    Louvanium. Bob thought that that had been arranged. Regrettably, it fell apart
                    because Tshombe couldn't believe himself to believe that he would be safe if he
                    went up to Leopoldville and put himself in the hands of Kasavubu and Mobutu. He
                    didn't come.</p>
                <p>The people from Kasai did come. Gazinga sent his people, but himself, a member of
                    Parliament, did not come down, and all of the remaining members of the lower
                    house of the Congolese Parliament disappeared behind the troops up at Louvanium.
                    The first signal we got from the embassy was that a Gazingist had been elected
                    as Speaker of the Chamber.</p>
                <p>I was then summoned to Secretary [Dean] Rusk's office to be asked by the
                    Secretary how sure we were that Gazinga would not be chosen prime minister, and
                    that this was a bad sign. Being eternally optimistic, I said that our repeated
                    head counts showed that he would not be. Kasavubu, under the constitution, was
                    the only person authorized to nominate he prime minister, and he had assured us
                    that he was going to nominate Cyrille Adoula, who was a moderate Belgian-style
                    socialist, and our head count showed that if nominated, Adoula would win.
                    Kasavubu was certainly not going to nominate Gazinga.</p>
                <p>There was some thought in higher reaches of the Department of State at this point
                    that maybe the African Bureau, particularly the Central African Affairs office,
                    was perhaps a little na�ve. There were some suggestions that it might even
                    resemble our Cuban experts on the eve of the Castro revolution or our China
                    experts on the eve of Mao taking over in China.</p>
                <p>A telegram was sent out to get the views of our ambassador there, Ed Gullion, in
                    Leopoldville, and he fired back assurance that he was confident that we would
                    emerge successful. So the inclination to ask Kasavubu to call the affair off
                    dropped, and Adoula was indeed nominated and he became prime minister. This was
                    in the fall of 1961.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>President Kennedy had taken a great personal interest in the affairs of the Congo
                    and the crisis. It was a crisis big enough to come to his attention, and he, I
                    think, was anxious to overcome what had proved to be a bad mistake when he had
                    continued the Cuban effort, the Bay of Pigs. So he was following the matter
                    very, very closely, and he would frequently have “Soapy” Williams over to the
                    White House to brief him on what was happening. “Soapy” would bring me along
                    with him. The President's interest was so profound that sometimes his questions
                    would exceed the details that his assistant secretary would have, and so I would
                    engage in a dialogue with the President, which was really exciting.</p>
                <p>On two different occasions, my secretary came into my office and said, with her
                    eyes bugging, that the President of the United States was on the line and wanted
                    to talk to me. I would salute, stand up, and pick up the telephone. He'd say, “I
                    just read in the newspapers (or heard on the radio) such and such. That does not
                    jive with what you've been telling me.” Then I would have to explain what was
                    going on. He would say, “Very well. Keep it up.” Finally, President Kennedy
                    decided that e was so thrilled with his success.</p>
                <p>I should back up just a bit. I said earlier that Gazinga had not come down to
                    attend the meeting a Louvanium, which had undercut his strength at the Louvanium
                    Parliament because he had shown cowardice. But he continued to sit up in
                    Stanleyville and make trouble. His r�gime was recognized by left-wing
                    governments throughout Africa and by the Soviet Bloc. Here public and
                    congressional criticism began to erupt from the conservative elements in the
                    press and the Congress, wondering why in the world the United States Government
                    was supporting a central government which was headed by a socialist, of all
                    parties, and was unable to do anything effective with Gazinga, who was an
                    admitted communist.</p>
                <p>Senator Thomas Dodd held a press conference just as the Congress was dissolving
                    for the Christmas recess, and said that as soon as he returned, his American
                    Affairs subcommittee, Pan American Affairs, I think it was called, would hold a
                    hearing to try to determine what in the world was going on down in the State
                    Department. In reply to a question as to if he had any dubious, questionable
                    personages in mind, he named two or three, and my name was at the top of the
                    list.</p>
                <p>The Secretary of State immediately informed the press that everything that was
                    being done by his department had his approval, and that if there was such a
                    hearing, he would be the first witness and he would assure the committee that he
                    had full confidence in his staff.</p>
                <p>The committee meeting opened on January 18, which, coincidentally, is my
                    birthday. I was able to walk into the committee room with the Washington Post in
                    hand, the headline of which said, “Gazinga Arrested by Adoula.” So I escaped
                    that horrendous hearing.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>We thus got rid of Gazinga, we resolved the Kasai matter, and Tshombe continued
                    to be a problem. As I indicated earlier, certain conservative elements in the
                    United States were very curious as to why, as someone put it, “we were being
                    beastly to this anti-communist, Christian Tshombe.” Several people, in
                    particular Senator Dodd, were particularly critical of our stand. They organized
                    the Katanga lobby and, to our horror, they organized a mass meeting at Madison
                    Square Garden—I can't remember exactly when—in the spring of 1962, where the
                    Katanga lobby was going to hold a mass meeting, and they invited Tshombe to come
                    to address this mass meeting.</p>
                <p>A parallel development was that President Kennedy was so proud of his success in
                    the Congo, that he invited Prime Minister Adoula to make an official visit to
                    the United States. On the very day that Kennedy was having Adoula for lunch in
                    the White House, a luncheon which I attended as possible translator-advisor to
                    Assistant Secretary Williams, I learned just before going to the White House for
                    that luncheon, that the Tshombe application for a visa to come to the Madison
                    Square Garden meeting, which the African Bureau had, we thought, arranged for it
                    to be refused, had been overturned. The African Bureau's decision had been
                    overturned by the Secretary's officer, or the seventh floor, at least, quite
                    possibly by Under Secretary George McGhee, who had not been very favorable up to
                    that point of our Congo policy.</p>
                <p>In any case, there I was in the White House with the President of the United
                    States and Prime Minister Adoula. When Adoula went to leave the White House
                    after the lunch, Kennedy escorted him. “Soapy” Williams went with them. Because
                    Adoula did not speak English and neither of them spoke French, I went along. So
                    I was present when the President put Adoula in the automobile and he drove off.
                    “Soapy” stood on the front stoop of the White House, them talking to each other,
                    people passing on the sidewalk shouted and waved at the President, and he waved
                    back. I stood there knowing that the President did not know that that afternoon
                    the press would probably learn that a visa had been issued to Tshombe.</p>
                <p>I mustered my courage, all three hands, and went up to the two gentlemen and
                    said, “Mr. President, something happened this morning that I think you should
                    know about.” And I told him that the decision had been made in the Department
                    that morning to issue Tshombe a visa, the very day that he had been entertaining
                    Adoula at the White House.</p>
                <p>Kennedy exploded, and he asked “Soapy” Williams how in the world that could
                    happen. “Soapy” started muttering about pressure from the Hill, and Kennedy's
                    long finger was poking “Soapy” in the chest, and he said, “That's why we've got
                    you in the State Department to handle matters like this. Get yourself back to
                    the State Department and stop this nonsense!” Whereupon “Soapy” ran off, the
                    President went back to the White House, I withdrew with my tail between my legs,
                    wondering what horror was going to befall me for appealing to the President of
                    the United States over at least the Under Secretary of State and not the
                    Secretary of State.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>All heck did break out. I was suspended as office director. Management of our
                    Congo policy was removed from the African Bureau and lodged personally in the
                    hands of George McGhee, and I walked the halls for a couple of weeks, wondering
                    if I would ever get another assignment.</p>
                <p>After, I think, two or three weeks of what we call in the Foreign Service
                    “walking the halls,” without any assignment, my pay was not suspended,
                    fortunately, but I had no office to sit in, no job to report to.</p>
                <p>Finally, I was rescued by people at management, by the Director of Personnel, who
                    gave me an office and worked out an assignment for me that was acceptable to all
                    concerned, and that happened to be the Deputy Chief of Mission position in Addis
                    Ababa, which had suddenly become open due to the incumbent Fred Hadsel, who had
                    been on home leave, finding in the course of his regular medical examination
                    that he had a shadow on his lung, which, fortunately, proved not to be
                    important, but which prevented his returning to Addis Ababa. There was urgency
                    in replacing him, because Vice President [Hubert] Humphrey, on a recent tour of
                    Africa, had formed a very strong dislike for Arthur Richards, who was then our
                    ambassador to Ethiopia, and insisted to the President and the Secretary of State
                    that he be replaced. He was about to be removed under those circumstances, so he
                    needed a deputy in a hurry.</p>
                <p>So my wife, Jean, and I were shipped out to Addis Ababa in a great hurry, and I'd
                    been assured before I left the Department that Art Richards would be informed
                    before I arrived, of his imminent transfer. He met me at the airport, which is
                    rather unusual for an ambassador, even for his deputy, and said he had done so
                    because he was impressed by the rapidity with which Fred Hadsel had been
                    replaced by my arrival. (Laughs) He wondered what was up. He obviously had not
                    heard. I told him on the drive back into the city from the airport what was
                    imminent. That, of course, was not very pleasant news for him to learn. He left
                    about ten day after I arrived, and I became charg� d'affaires, which is a little
                    more important than being charg� between absences of an ambassador. This was
                    between ambassadors, and this period went on for about five or six months before
                    Ed Korry was named ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get into Ethiopia, I would like to go back again
                        to your experience as Director of African Affairs. As you so clearly
                        indicated, the then Congo developed into a very high profile of concern on
                        the part of the Kennedy Administration, going on up to the President
                        himself. There were a variety of players in the act, including “Soapy”
                        Williams, as you mentioned, and McGhee. Who was basically calling the shots
                        as far as our Congo policy was concerned at the time? What were some of the
                        differences of opinion, even in the Department of State, between such
                        organizations as the African Bureau, the European Bureau, and perhaps even
                        our embassies in Kinshasa, or Leopoldville, at the time, and Brussels?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>VANCE: There certainly were differences. The battles were long and all but
                    bloody. Our then ambassador to Brussels was Douglas MacArthur II, and he
                    bombarded the Department with two- and three-section telegrams containing the
                    advice and points of view of the Belgian Government which differed very sharply
                    from ours, especially in the way that we were badgering that great conservative
                    statesman Moise Tshombe.</p>
                <p>The European Bureau spokesman was Bill Burdett, Deputy Assistant Secretary of
                    State, and had been assigned the Congo problem by his assistant secretary. Then
                    the Office of the Bureau of International Organization Affairs, known in the
                    Department as IO at the time, was very pleased with what was going on in the
                    Congo, because the U.N. was, in effect, managing the Congo with its experts and
                    maintaining law and order with its troops.</p>
                <p>So the battles would be joined every time an instruction telegram went out to our
                    embassy in Leopoldville. It had to be cleared by IO and EUR, and very often IO
                    would almost always agree with AF's point of view, and EUR would almost always
                    disagree. Then, therefore, when bureaus disagree, the matter is appealed upwards
                    for resolution. The next step is the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, who
                    was at the time George McGhee, who tended, on the whole, to favor the views of
                    EUR, but not always. Then if we lost at that level, we would appeal it to the
                    next step, which was to George Ball, who usually came down on AF's side. Very
                    rarely did it reach the Secretary's level.</p>
                <p>Ed Gullion, who was our ambassador at the time in Leopoldville, was strongly
                    supportive. We and he saw eye to eye on what should be done and what shouldn't
                    be done. As I say, Ambassador MacArthur usually differed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in AFC, the U.N. had sent peacekeeping
                        troops to the Congo. But in the U.N. itself, as I think you've already
                        hinted, there was a considerable difference of opinion as to the value or
                        the desirability of becoming involved in Zaire. Could you comment on that
                        and your feelings or thoughts about our own relations with the U.N. presence
                        in Zaire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: The first U.N. manager, or director—I've forgotten his title—of the U.N.
                    program in Zaire was an Indian by the name of Dewal. Regrettably, we thought in
                    the AF Bureau that he tended to favor the Gazingist types. So we raised such a
                    considerable fuss with the U.N. that he was transferred and replaced by a
                    gentleman from Ghana, who was Bob Gardner. We got along very well with Bob
                    Gardner, and we continued to do our best to bring Tshombe around. But he
                    continued to resist all efforts, and when we'd get him in a corner, he'd agree,
                    and then as soon as he found a way out of the corner, he would disagree.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>There was fighting going on between U.N. forces in Katanga, and Tshombe's
                    gendarmes, were officered and equipped by Belgian mercenaries and mercenaries
                    from other countries, including South Africa. Just as the U.N. forces would get
                    him in a corner and he would appear having to give in, he would appeal to the
                    U.S. Government. A couple of times he asked President Kennedy, one time in
                    particular, to arrange a truce negotiation. Well, we couldn't say no, so he
                    agreed, and there was a truce. Tshombe flew up on a U.N. escort into a site down
                    towards the mouth of the Congo River, and there it appeared that there was going
                    to be a settlement, but as soon as he got back to �lisabethville, he backed
                    down.</p>
                <p>After I had gone on to Ethiopia, I learned that the U.N. had finally stopped
                    listening to the United States' urging to hold back and not rough up Mr.
                    Tshombe, and Bob Gardner and the then Indian commanding general just kept
                    marching on Tshombe, and finally forced him into exile in Spain. A great noise
                    erupted at the U.N., and the U.S. was furious that they'd told U Thant to order
                    the U.N. troops to stop marching on Tshombe, and they hadn't stopped. The
                    Secretary General of the U.N. at the time was U Thant. His predecessor, Dag
                    Hammarskjold, had been killed in an airplane crash when he was flying out to
                    �lisabethville, in order to try once again to persuade Tshombe to give up his
                    secession.</p>
                <p>In this case, Bob Gardner arrived in Addis Ababa, where I was then stationed, to
                    take charge of the Economic Commission for Africa under the U.N., because he had
                    taken care of Tshombe, and the Congo was reunited. Therefore, the U.N. operation
                    could wind down. So as soon as I had a chance, I asked Bob Gardner what in the
                    world had happened. He told me that the commander of the Indian troops in the
                    U.N. forces there, had decided that Tshombe just had to go. He said, “I knew
                    that the United States Government would scream and holler if we got rough with
                    Tshombe, so I just, in effect, turned off my hearing device. We just did
                    it.”</p>
                <p>U Thant flew out to Leopoldville to find out what had happened, a breakdown in
                    communication or a rebellion in the U.N. against his instructions, that he had
                    assured the United States that he had ordered the U.N. troops to stop. Bob
                    Gardner told me he went to the airport to meet U Thant. As soon as U Thant got
                    in his car and they drove away from the crowd that had been out to welcome him,
                    U Thant embraced him and said, “That was a fine job you did, Bob. Thank the Lord
                    that one's over.”</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>The other amusing story about Tshombe's visa that I omitted earlier is that one
                    of the loudest voices complaining about the United States' refusal of a visa to
                    Tshombe was that of Arthur Crock, that great sunderer of the press, repeatedly
                    expressed horror in his column. But shortly after the refusal of the visa, t the
                    annual Gridiron dinner, at which the President and other notables are roasted,
                    as the press says, but then they are given a chance to reply, and JFK stood up
                    to reply, and he said, “I see my good friend Arthur Crock in the audience.
                    Arthur, I'll make a deal with you. I'll give Tshombe a visa if you'll invite him
                    for lunch at the Metropolitan Club.” This was back in the days when blacks were
                    not admitted to the Metropolitan Club, and Arthur Clock was a frequenter at a
                    prominent table at that club each noon. We never heard another peep from Arthur
                    Crock about Tshombe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you look at the Congo as it was in 1960, in terms of
                        United States interests, narrowly speaking, we had some missionaries there,
                        we were interested in minerals production, copper, uranium, manganese,
                        cobalt. We were also generally interested, I guess you could fairly say, in
                        the decolonization process in Africa. What, in your judgment, triggered such
                        high-level interest in the Congo in those days? Looking back now, would you
                        say that the development of our policy in those very same days was
                        relatively successful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I think that our high-level interest was, as I began to suggest earlier,
                    due to the personality of President John F. Kennedy and his great interest in
                    foreign affairs and his great embarrassment that his first foreign affairs
                    effort had been such a disaster. He continued the effort that had been planned
                    to help the Cuban anti-Castroites land in Cuba, a program that had been planned
                    just before he became President, but with which he went along. It was, as we all
                    know, a disaster. Vietnam was beginning to become important, but had not yet
                    assumed major importance. It was still largely a French problem for the
                    relatively brief period we're talking about in history.</p>
                <p>So our policy, which favored the restoration of the Congo's original colonial
                    geographic boundaries, was indicated in our mind, in the African bureau, by the
                    fact that boundaries of almost every African state had been drawn in the
                    colonial period, depending upon where the troops and explorers and the related
                    representatives of the colonial powers were at the time, without any regard to
                    tribal or ethnic boundaries, and very little regard to economic sense. We
                    recognized that, but as every country in Africa, most of which by that time were
                    newly independent, had that weakness, we believed, as indeed the Africans
                    themselves did, at one of their early meetings of the Organization of African
                    Unity at Addis Ababa, they all agreed that this was the situation, but if one
                    country tried to take a piece of neighboring country for tribal or ethnic
                    reasons, then all of Africa would disintegrate into chaos. Therefore, they all
                    agreed that present inherited boundaries would be recognized and there would be
                    only peaceful efforts, if any, to correct them.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Also the United States' African policy favored the larger countries, because we
                    saw that the disintegration of the former French colonial structure to many
                    small independent countries, most of which were economically inevitable, that
                    was going to provide for a lot of instability in the future, and that the larger
                    the structure, the more economically viable it would be.We believed that the
                    Congo, with its boundaries as drawn during the colonial period, was an
                    economically viable unit if its leaders could bring its people to regard
                    themselves as Congolese, rather than members of each of the tribes. That, I
                    think, is basically what finally happened in the history of the Congo between
                    the time I've just discussed and four or five years late, was one of great
                    unrest and instability, when they were trying to overcome their tribal
                    differences.</p>
                <p>There was a major tribal rebellion of the Swahili Simbas, which seized for a time
                    a good part of eastern Zaire, of eastern Congo, and finally took Stanleyville,
                    and there seized the houses and the U.S. consulate in Stanleyville and a great
                    many Belgian private citizens and advisors and teachers.</p>
                <p>Eventually, the Simba rebellion was overcome and Mobutu seized power, and his
                    rebellion put the Army in control. There certainly has not been a great deal of
                    what we call democracy, but at least it began to make a country and to make most
                    of its inhabitants think of themselves as Congolese or, today, Zairians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me interrupt you for a moment, because I want to take
                        you into your time as Ambassador in Zaire, which began in 1969, skipping
                        over the period of time when you were DCM in Addis, followed by your first
                        ambassadorship in Chad, then a tour for a year as Foreign Service inspector.
                        You also did a side job as African Affairs advisors to the U.N. General
                        Assembly in 1968.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In 1969, you became ambassador to Zaire, and you lasted in that job well over
                    four years, which is something of a record in terms of ambassadorial
                    appointments. When you arrived in 1969, the cast of characters had changed.
                    Mobutu was already president. Territorial integrity had been preserved. What
                    were the problems you inherited then? What are your feelings about what came
                    after you arrived in the subsequent years?</p>
                <p>VANCE: One of the first problems we faced after I arrived was what to do about
                    Mobutu's nationalization of the Union Miniere. When Mobutu seized power in his
                    coup of November of 1965, one of the first things he did was to nationalize the
                    Union Miniere. We could recognize that that was an understandable human
                    reaction, because the Union Miniere, as I indicated earlier, had helped Tshombe
                    and encouraged Tshombe to mount his secession.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Union Miniere was the giant Belgium-based mining company
                        in Katanga.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>VANCE: A huge subsidiary, but nonetheless a subsidiary, of the Soci�t� Generale,
                    which was as powerful in many respects as the government in Belgium. An amusing
                    footnote is that the Place Royale in Brussels has, as a rectangular park, four
                    sides, at one end is the royal palace. At the other end is Parliament, the
                    opposite end. Then of the two sides, on one side there's the Soci�t� Generale
                    headquarters, and on the other side is the U.S. Embassy. People would giggle
                    about the juxtaposition of the relative powers in Belgium.</p>
                <p>The Union Miniere had been nationalized by Mobutu, and the Congolese simply did
                    not have the trained manpower that it took to manage a huge mining operation of
                    that nature. Obviously, they could have turned to other countries to recruit
                    leadership, but we believed that notwithstanding the love-hate relationship
                    which always exists between a former colony and a former metropolitan
                    government, that the people of the former metropolitan country are much more
                    likely to be successful, or be willing to come out in sufficient numbers and go
                    into the distant corners of the former colony and do what has to be done.</p>
                <p>So we certainly did not, although some Belgians criticized the United States'
                    intent to try to “steal” the Congo from them during this earlier period that
                    we've been talking about that I was in the AFC, but we kept assuring our Belgian
                    friends, many of whom I knew personally from service in Belgium, that all we
                    were trying to do was to take the albatross of neo-colonialism, a term which was
                    invented by the press to describe what certain Belgians were doing in the Congo,
                    off their backs so they could play their appropriate role.</p>
                <p>So we recommended to Mobutu that he strike a deal with a Belgian company, and not
                    inquire too deeply into how it used the proceeds of its management of former
                    Union Miniere property, because being a corporation related to Soci�t� Generale,
                    quite possibly some of these funds would find their way to former Union Miniere
                    shareholders. That would take the curse off the nationalization. Nothing is more
                    injurious to a developing country's reputation amongst foreign corporate
                    investors than a major nationalization. We thought that we saw that the Congo
                    should get correct its reputation by making such an arrangement. They did.</p>
                <p>Mobutu did gulp a couple of times and make an issue to agree to a management
                    contract with a company called General Mining Company, in English, which brought
                    Belgian operatives in and has been a successful operation ever since.</p>
                <p>We also, at the same time, helped the Congolese Government revise their initial
                    investment code to govern foreign investments, because we thought that the
                    potential wealth of the Congo could be developed more rapidly, not only if the
                    Belgian private-sector position was restored, but if other countries' private
                    sectors, particularly that of the United States, could be encouraged to go
                    there. We did that. Our Department of Commerce spread that word around.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Very shortly, about less than a year after I arrived, we were able to arrange an
                    official visit by Mobutu to the United States, and we urged him and our
                    government to use this occasion to encourage U.S. private sector to see the
                    opportunities for foreign investment in the Congo. This, indeed, happened. Pan
                    American built the first international hotel, the Intercontinental Hotel, and
                    got the management contract for Air Zaire. Meanwhile, Mobutu had changed the
                    name from the Congo to Zaire. City Bank opened a branch. A major grain company
                    opened a flour mill in Matadi, and General Motors and Goodyear Tire both opened
                    plants in Kinshasa. There was a considerable American private sector.</p>
                <p>The Congolese economy, because of the very find, excellent prices obtained for
                    its raw materials like copper, cobalt, uranium, and diamonds, its economy was so
                    successful that we moved Zaire from grant assistance to loan assistance in this
                    period. Eventually, shortly before I left, at the beginning of the collapse of
                    the economies of most of the developing world, which were the direct outcome of
                    the formation of OPEC and the incredible driving up of oil prices, which
                    destroyed the economies of most of the developing world that didn't have its own
                    oil supply, and damaged even the developed world, in my opinion, and was not
                    favorable in the long run, even for the major oil producers.</p>
                <p>I haven't been able to understand why we appeared to, in some ways, support the
                    creation of OPEC; we should have done everything possible to prevent its
                    creation.</p>
                <p>I think that on the whole, most Congolese now, education is widespread, there's
                    free public education, there are many thousands of Congolese university
                    graduates.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, our gift at independence to the Congo—I've forgotten the number,
                    but several hundred university full fellowships. We found that once they had
                    been chosen carefully, they still had to be put through a year or, in some
                    cases, two years of preparatory training in the United States before they could
                    cope with university studies.</p>
                <p>I think, on the whole, as I look back on our policy toward Zaire with regard to
                    Mobutu, it wasn't all that bad. He certainly is not perfect, but I think Zaire
                    could have, and still could, do much worse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mobutu, of course, is still president of Zaire. His
                        relations with our chiefs of mission have been rocky at times. They were not
                        during your time. I'd be interested in hearing your judgments about Mobutu
                        himself and what it was that you were able to accomplish in terms of
                        personal relationships that led eventually to your receiving a decoration at
                        the time you left, the Order of Leopard.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>VANCE: I think that I was able to develop a special relationship with Mobutu
                    because he knew of my considerable background in Congolese affairs and of the
                    helpful role I had played in previous assignments. We got along very well. I saw
                    him often alone. Some of the things that I endeavored to advise him on were not
                    successful. For example, I saw that foreign investors were coming in.</p>
                <p>One of the foreign imports that I feared would become all too acceptable and
                    received in a developing country was the question of corruption. I tried to
                    explain to Mobutu that he should do his best to strongly discourage this on the
                    part of his subordinates, because I pointed out that he should be interested in
                    having the support of the real best judgment of his supporters, and not the
                    views of those who were currently renting the favorable views of his supporters.
                    I regret to say that that effort was not widely successful.</p>
                <p>Also, I noted that as years went by, most of the time I was there, Mobutu paid
                    great attention to detail and really tried, by travel throughout the country, to
                    build a stronger and more viable country for his citizenry. But I gather that
                    more recently, as I've seen him on occasion when I've gone back or seen him
                    here, I understand that he's paying less attention to detail. After all, he's
                    been absolute ruler since 1965, and that's now 23 years. That's a long, long
                    time to be busy seven-plus days a week and 24-plus hours a day. So it's
                    understandable.</p>
                <p>Currently, I think he has a pretty good Cabinet. He's delegating, in effect,
                    authority to that Cabinet, and things seem to be going reasonably well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your time beginning in 1969, the fevered pitch of
                        our interest in Zaire had died down somewhat. Did you feel that the
                        development of policy and, indeed, the carrying-out of policy was, in
                        effect, being carried out basically between yourself and the Bureau of
                        African Affairs? To what extent did you feel that you were able to develop
                        and influence our policy there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I had the impression that high-level interest in the Congo was very
                    fleeting in our government. Therefore, in effect, I was doing a lot of evolving
                    of American policy towards the Congo myself, with the very excellent staff that
                    I had working with me in Leopoldville. Although the backup of the African Bureau
                    was always very friendly and very effective and very helpful, my old friend
                    David Newsom was Assistant Secretary for a good part of this period, and our
                    views on what should be done coincided almost invariably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One question I wanted to explore a bit with you in the
                        earlier period we were talking about, and can apply, in fact, to both
                        periods of time when you were intimately involved with Zaire, concerns the
                        role of other agencies in the developing and carrying-out of our policy in
                        Zaire. Would you like to comment on that?</hi>

                <p>VANCE: The problem that is faced by ambassadors, especially in countries where
                    there is a very considerable presence of a variety of U.S. Government agencies
                    and a large staff, is a problem for any given ambassador, and it has gotten
                    worse over the years as management of foreign policy in Washington has become
                    more and more difficult, with the explosion of different agencies, each of which
                    thinks that its view of what should be done in a given country should
                    predominate, and also the explosion of staff in the Congress and the great
                    increase in the congressional impression and belief that each one of them is
                    qualified to decide and announce American foreign policy.</p>
                <p>This was beginning during my period in the Congo, but had not reached alarming
                    proportions, I didn't think. I had the feeling that I had very little difficulty
                    in coordinating the positions of activities of AID, CIA, USIA, and our military
                    in the Congo. I was then, and now, convinced that it was because of my charm,
                    but when I got back, after almost five years in the Congo, and found myself
                    facing Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who informed me that my next
                    assignment was to be his executive director in charge of coordinating all U.S.
                    Government federal agencies abroad in the control of narcotics, I saluted, of
                    course, and said, “Sir, I'll do whatever you tell me, but why me? I don't know
                    anything about narcotics.”</p>
                <p>He said, “You are my favorite son of a bitch, and I mean to do something about
                    it.” He had apparently concluded that from my performance in Zaire. (Laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Kissinger take any active interest in Zaire while you
                        were ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No. I've forgotten the dates, but he was, of course, during virtually all
                    of the time, at least, National Security Advisor to the President. Then he moved
                    over to the State Department, and he kept both jobs for a short while, in
                    effect, part of the time due to Brent Scowcroft's great ability with people.</p>
                <p>I didn't think that Kissinger had a great interest, but what he had observed, he
                    had apparently liked, because he stuck me with my most difficult assignment in
                    my 35 years in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Returning a moment to Zaire itself, the period while you
                        were ambassador was a rather quieter period in terms of internal unrest, I
                        think, than your earlier experience. Did you find that Zaire, while
                        territorial integrity had been preserved, had advanced under Mobutu in terms
                        of a nation state? Were the tribal divisions sufficiently still serious
                        enough to be at least a threat? In other words, had Zaire evolved
                        considerably from the very divisive period of time when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>VANCE: It definitely had evolved. Mobutu continued to fear that there might be
                    some threat especially from the Katanga. For that reason, for a long time he
                    kept, in my opinion, an unwarranted suspicion of a senior tribal figure, a very
                    able man, and who was twice foreign minister and twice charged by Mobutu with
                    high treason. The first time, Mobutu caught him. That was while I was ambassador
                    in Zaire. He was sentenced to death. I believe I made some contribution when I
                    urged Mobutu, the next time I saw him, just talking alone, that it would make a
                    very unfortunate impression if the execution was carried out. In fact, it was
                    commuted to life imprisonment, then it was commuted to enforced residence in his
                    native village, and then the next thing we knew, he was foreign minister again.
                    He later became prime minister.</p>
                <p>I think that by the time I left Zaire in 1974, the Zairians were basically
                    regarding themselves as Zairians. Certainly there were older Zairians who still
                    regarded themselves in a tribal way, like we in the United States think of
                    ourselves—in my case, from Minnesota. There are still local loyalties. I think
                    that, on the whole, they've done an excellent job of building a nation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mobutu, of course, had consolidated power in himself and,
                        as you mentioned, was a very strong leader. Had he retained some of the cast
                        of characters of the period of time when you first became involved with
                        Zaire, such people as Justin (Inaudible), or had they disappeared entirely
                        from the scene?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Mobutu was particularly close to him at the beginning, and he continued to
                    be foreign minister for a period of time, including the beginning of my sojourn
                    as ambassador. But then they had a falling-out, and he withdrew to his native
                    province up river, and now he's become a private businessman. This is what has
                    happened to move of the original characters, but not all.</p>
                <p>Mobutu continued to work with most of them for quite a period of time, and some
                    of them are still with him. For example, his leading financial advisor while I
                    was there and governor of the national bank, Jules Sabwa, is now, I believe,
                    prime minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By and large, I may be overstating the case a little bit,
                        Zaire has more often than not supported us in interests elsewhere in the
                        world. That is, their vote in the U.N., for example, relatively speaking,
                        anyway, has been more with us than, say, the socialist or communist world.
                        Was there a reason for that? Was Mobutu naturally conservative? What do you
                        think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: I think both. He was naturally conservative, but also his great friend at
                    every stage of his life had been the United States. So it's a natural outcome of
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Mobutu ever try to play the United States off against
                        Belgium?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>VANCE: Oh, often! That's really the favorite outdoor sport throughout the whole
                    period. I referred earlier to the love-hate relationship between the Congolese,
                    the Zairians, and the Belgians. I understand that there's currently a great
                    breakdown in the relationships due to something that someone said in Belgium. I
                    haven't heard all the details. It was at a high level, and it just infuriated
                    the Congolese, the Zairians, and they almost stopped talking to each other. But
                    it is still to be noted that whenever a Zairian leader's child is ready to go to
                    the university, if he can arrange it, he arranges to send the child to Belgium
                    to study. That's where they travel on vacation. The Belgians continue, of
                    course, to take enormous interest in the Congo, because many, many Belgian
                    families have had members who lived in the Congo, so they are very well informed
                    about Congolese developments and follow this very closely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mobutu, at least in Western eyes, did one or two bizarre
                        things which I'd like you to comment on. For example, there was a time when
                        he changed his own name. He also proscribed certain holidays that he decided
                        would no longer be celebrated. Could you comment on this aspect of
                        Mobutu?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Even before I arrived in Zaire, when I was still in Chad, Mobutu had
                    launched a program of Africanization of place names and people's names, and even
                    of dress. He abandoned the coat and tie of Western Europe, and wore what really
                    looks like a Nehru jacket, with either a scarf or no shirt at all, nothing
                    behind the V-neck of the jacket. He called it � bas coats, which is “down with
                    coats” in French. He wore a leopard-skin hat shaped like the overseas hat of our
                    World War I uniform. As you indicated, they changed the place names and personal
                    names, all of which had been chosen by the Belgian colonials. He persuaded
                    President Tombalbaye of Chad to bring these things about.The latter explained to
                    me that his capital city was called Fort Lamy, named after a French explorer,
                    and the second biggest city was called Fort Archambault, and he said, “Neither
                    of them is a fort. Why in the world should we keep those names?” So he changed
                    them to the capital of N'Djamena.</p>
                <p>Mobutu even changed the name of the river, the Congo River. It's called the Zaire
                    in the Zaire. He claimed that the Congo tribe that inhabited—and still
                    inhabits—the mouth of the Congo River, when they were found there when the first
                    Portuguese arrived in the continent, he said they called this river “Zaire,”
                    which means “the river” in the Congolese tribal language. He said, “Being
                    primarily a Catholic country, all of us have Christian first names named after
                    the Christian saints. What in the world have we got to do with Saint this and
                    Saint that? Joseph! I'm Joseph, which is the husband of the Virgin Mary, which
                    seems a strange name for a Congolese to have.” So he changed his name to Sese
                    Seko, and it goes on to maybe 15 or 20 more words that describe him.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>All of them changed their names by his orders, all of the Congo, except his wife.
                    Her name was Marie Antoinette, and she obviously was damned if she was going to
                    give up Marie Antoinette and take on an African name. Yet the press and the
                    radios could not continue to call her Marie Antoinette, so from that moment on,
                    she was always referred to as “Mama Mobutu.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the holidays?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Oh, yes. He had a great falling-out with the Catholic Church and banned
                    the use of all Christian holidays, including Christmas briefly. That's nonsense
                    now.</p>
                <p>I had a very amusing encounter with the Catholic archbishop in Zaire. He finally
                    became a cardinal—Cardinal Malulu. He was complaining to me during this real
                    breach between Mobutu and the church. He was complaining to me, and I said, “But
                    your church is responsible for Mobutu having reached the position he has
                    reached.”</p>
                <p>“What? What do you mean?”</p>
                <p>“Well,” I said, “I've been told by Congolese and even confirmed by Mobutu that he
                    attended a church school up river, and the church had a rule at the time that if
                    a student who had been so fortunate as to be accepted into a church school, had
                    the nerve to misbehave to the extent of visiting that den of sin and iniquity
                    called Leopoldville without proper authorization of his teachers, he was
                    immediately dismissed from school and put in the Army as a private. I've been
                    told that that is how Mobutu got into the Force Publique.”</p>
                <p>My partner in the conversation looked aghast and changed the subject.
                    (Laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Mobutu's adopting a leopard-skin hat. I
                        believe it's correct to say that you have such a hat. How did you acquire
                        that, Mr. Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: It's one of my cherished possessions that was given to me by what's
                    referred to in French as le guy. It was after I had been decorated with the
                    Order of the Commander of the Leopard. I was instructed by the president that
                    whenever I wore that decoration, I should wear the hat, whether it be indoors or
                    outdoors. Once in a while I do so. Not often. (Laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back now on your close to five-year tour as
                        ambassador in Zaire, what gives you most satisfaction?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>VANCE: I think the degree of success that we had and the United States had in
                    that period in helping the Congolese leadership create a nation. It certainly
                    was not a total success, but as developing countries in Africa go, it is
                    certainly not amongst the worst. That is a source of satisfaction. As I said
                    today in this interview, I put a lot of years off and on, either directly or
                    indirectly, into Zaire. It's been very interesting. I think I've been lucky to
                    have had that much association over a 35-year career with one country. I guess
                    that doesn't often happen. I also feel similarly close to Belgium for the same
                    reasons. We still have very good Belgian friends who we see from time to time,
                    who visit us, and we visit them.</p>
                <p>At one point when I was ambassador to Zaire, we were returning for home leave, I
                    think, and I decided that I would see if it were convenient for one of my
                    closest Belgian friends for us to visit him and his wife. So I communicated with
                    him before I sought permission from the Department of State. I also had to seek
                    concurrence from my counterpart, the American Ambassador to Belgium, so I
                    wouldn't appear to be “poaching” in his preserves. My great friend, Pierre
                    Harmel, happened to be prime minister of Belgium at the time. I did not convey
                    that to young Mr. Eisenhower, who was son of President Eisenhower, our
                    ambassador to Belgium. Toward the end of our communication, he seemed rather
                    reluctant to concur, and I had trouble getting his attention in the telegrams,
                    asking if he concurred. Then when I finally told him who I would be visiting, I
                    got approval.</p>
                <p>We were entertained for a drink at the residence, and I don't think he was
                    terribly amused by the fact that I told him, when our plane door opened when we
                    landed in Brussels, that at the foot of the steps was the prime minister, who
                    put us in his car to take us to his house. (Laughs)</p>
                <p>Pierre Harmel is a great person, and we got to know him very well when we were
                    assigned in Brussels. We arrived right after the war, and he had been Minister
                    of Education in a Catholic government that had just been defeated. He was in the
                    opposition. I got to know him I've forgotten how, and we became very close
                    friends. The only way to make friends with very, very senior people is when
                    they're not senior. He was delighted. I arranged for him, in fact, to have a
                    Leader Grant tour of the United States. By coincidence, Jean and I and our
                    children returned on the SS America from home leave, and discovered that Pierre
                    Harmel was o the same ship. So we sat together at meals all the way across. We
                    and the Harmels have been very close. Their older son came and stayed with us
                    for a while in Washington, and we still communicate.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, I now would like to get to your time in
                        Ethiopia, which was from 1962 to 1966, where you were deputy chief of
                        mission. That was a period of time when Ethiopia was a very different
                        Ethiopia n many ways from what it is today. Haile Selassie was still
                        emperor. The old feudal system of Ethiopia was still in pretty much full
                        flower, much of which has disappeared now since the revolution of 1974. I
                        wonder if you could tell us your impressions of Ethiopia at the time and
                        your relations, if any, or at least your impressions of Haile Selassie.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>VANCE: I think that the period of time that we were in Ethiopia is one of the
                    most difficult for me to analyze as to what did we do wrong or what went wrong.
                    Shortly after we left, it fell apart and was taken over by the disaster known as
                    the derg.</p>
                <p>I was in Ethiopia the four years. As I said earlier, I was charg� d'affaires
                    between ambassadors at the beginning, so at the beginning I got to know the
                    emperor on a personal basis. Because I speak French and he spoke French and
                    Amharic, period, full stop with him—he spoke almost no English—I was able to
                    communicate and talk to him directly without an interpreter, which most
                    Americans are not able to do if they didn't know French.</p>
                <p>He had decided, after he was returned to his country by the British after the
                    war, that he would have to make strenuous efforts to modernize his country, and
                    he ruled, among other things, that education for the future would be in English,
                    not in Amharic, so that his educated people could communicate with the rest of
                    the world more easily.</p>
                <p>He said also that public education would be pressed. Before the Italian
                    occupation, education had been entirely in the hands of the Coptic Church, and
                    it was said that there were many Coptic Church teachers who believed still that
                    the earth was flat and other wonderful bits of intellectualism of that nature.
                    As I look back on my four years in Ethiopia, that man dragged his country
                    kicking and screaming out of the cave age.</p>
                <p>What happened? He regarded the United States as his greatest friend, and we
                    supplied his prime minister with a legal advisor. The second one was there when
                    we were there, Donald Parradis. We helped them draft a modern constitution which
                    envisaged a Parliament with two houses, which would have a general election,
                    have public participation in the elections. The emperor would appoint a prime
                    minister, there would be a Cabinet, and it all looked like Thomas Jefferson had
                    been at work.</p>
                <p>However, looking back on it, the emperor, I should add, although very friendly to
                    me personally and to close foreign friends, people he regarded as close friends,
                    he really was God in the eyes of his people. I've been standing with him and
                    have seen reasonably senior Ethiopians come up and prostrate themselves flat on
                    the floor in front of him.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Although he was 70 years old when we arrived, I certainly can attest to his good
                    health and strenuous physical capacities, because he would frequently go on
                    inspection tours of this, that, and the other thing, and the diplomatic corps
                    would be invited. I was very considerably younger than he, but I would get out
                    of breath trying to keep up with him at that altitude. He just practically ran,
                    almost a dog trot, as he conducted these inspections. There was certainly
                    nothing senile about him during my period.He was so interested in education and
                    expanding the public schools, that he leapt at the possibility of having a large
                    Peace Corps contingency. We sent 600 Peace Corps volunteers to Ethiopia, which
                    was at the very beginning of the Peace Corps, and it practically doubled the
                    faculty of the secondary schools in Ethiopia. So we should not be astonished
                    that we instilled a lot of ideas and ideals that were very strange to then
                    feudal Ethiopia in the youth that was growing up at the time. We helped him open
                    Haile Selassie University, funded it, supplied teachers, and started turning out
                    these highly educated young people.</p>
                <p>We did not realize how really, totally, 1000% feudal the old man was. He simply
                    was not about to delegate anything to anybody. We used to joke that he decided
                    whether to put a 25-cent stamp on any letter that left the government, or a
                    50-cent stamp. His unfortunate son kept on being absolutely nothing but Crown
                    Prince on and on and on, until he finally had a nervous breakdown and became a
                    vegetable. He went to Switzerland.</p>
                <p>I'm told that finally what happened was the emperor became senile and lost
                    control of what was happening. I can't understand it. What happened was, he
                    lived too long. If he had tried to use the educated, trained youth and the
                    structure in the government. We talked him into land control and land reform,
                    brought in airplanes to map the country so that people would know who owned
                    what, rather than just the dukes and their equivalents owning everything in
                    sight from the mountaintop. It all fell apart. I think it all fell apart because
                    he lived too long, and people got fed up with the crap. It was just very sad to
                    look back at that period.</p>
                <p>We were able to drive everywhere in Ethiopia. They had an agricultural advisory
                    structure that was supported by an agricultural college and high school that
                    we'd founded, that had county agents helping the farmers throughout Ethiopia.
                    This was the country that was the breadbasket of the Middle East, and now
                    everybody's starving to death. It's just an extremely sad view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later it became fashionable to echo what you've just been
                        saying, that the emperor was no longer able to keep up with developments
                        toward modernization, if that's the right word, in Ethiopia. That failure
                        was one of the direct causes of the revolution that took place in 1974.
                        Another was supposedly his failure to recognize the seriousness of the
                        famine that had occurred just before that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Were you able to recognize in the period of time that you were there, 1962 to
                    1966, the trend that would develop later on, or did that come later?</p>
                <p>VANCE: I think it came later, because we kept being asked by Washington to report
                    on how we would appraise the possibility of a revolution, and there didn't
                    appear to be any signs of one coming up. I think we probably weren't wise enough
                    to see the slippage of the training or the creation of all these hopeful young
                    people. We saw the form of government that they had, but it was never used. We
                    should have seen that this was headed for a dust-up, but we didn't. I think it
                    started after that.</p>
                <p>There had been a coup, but it was an in-house, in-palace coup. The bodyguard and
                    police chiefs were, regrettably, the emperor's brothers, and the two of them
                    pulled off a coup while he was traveling aboard. But that was an in-house coup
                    within the feudal system, so that there were no signs that we detected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a considerable American presence in Ethiopia
                        while you were there, specifically in Asmara, where we maintained a
                        fair-sized base. Is that fair enough?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes, absolutely, and we had a very large MAAG, military advisory group, a
                    large AID mission, a large aid program. As I indicated earlier, we had an
                    enormous Peace Corps contingent and advisors in the government of Ethiopia. An
                    American advisor was in the office of the prime minister, with an open door to
                    the emperor.</p>
                <p>I remember something that should have tipped me off, I guess, during one of my
                    early calls on him when I was charg� after I arrived. We used to get telegrams
                    from Washington that would start out, “You will make clear to HIM (His Imperial
                    Majesty): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.” I went over to deliver one of those. Of course, I
                    tried to put it forward more diplomatically.</p>
                <p>His Majesty interrupted me after I got started, and he said, “I want to assure
                    you that we will always value highly the advice of our great friends, the
                    Americans. But Mr. Charg� (this was all in French), would you mind telling me
                    when you were born?”</p>
                <p>I said, “I was born, Your Majesty, January 18, 1917.”</p>
                <p>“Oh,” said His Majesty, “that's just about a year after I became regent. What
                    were you saying, Mr. Charg�?” (Laughs) In other words, “Drop dead. You guys
                    don't know what you're talking about.”</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ethiopia, of course, was the one African nation that had
                        not ever really been colonized. The Italians tried to do it at the end of
                        the 19th century. They really only occupied it in the late thirties. There
                        were some evidences of Italian presence there, particularly the roads the
                        Italians had created. Was there any other foreign presence there of
                        consequence while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No, I don't think so, not of significance. The Italian roads were
                    certainly evident, the great road building of the descendants of Rome. We helped
                    the Ethiopians maintain them by bringing advisors from our highway departments,
                    and we enlarged road systems and helped maintain the ones in existence. As I
                    indicated earlier, I drove over most of the corner of Ethiopia during that four
                    years. The main road system was made open at every corner.</p>
                <p>We had even American Protestant missionaries, strangely enough, in a country
                    headed by the emperor, who was the defender of the faith of the Coptic Church.
                    There were probably other national missionaries. There was a major one in
                    southwestern Ethiopia whose followers extended over the border into southern
                    Sudan, and this caused a certain amount of problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just before your arrival in 1962, a year or so, the
                        beginnings of the Eritrean separatist movement had taken place, a movement
                        that's still going on. Was that an issue between us and the emperor at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: No. We were involved from the very beginning, from the early stirrings of
                    that Eritrean movement, because one of our mapping planes made a forced landing
                    out in the boondocks of Eritrea, and the crew was seized. We had quite a long
                    negotiation getting them released. It was a little awkward because we were
                    negotiating with the ELF and the emperor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was another province that also became concerned with
                        separatism, namely Tigre. Perhaps you'd like to comment on that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Yes. I indicated earlier that we would periodically be questioned by
                    Washington about the prospect of a rebellion. I had become personally friendly
                    with the then chief of staff of the Ethiopian Government, General Yassou. One
                    night after a small party at our house, at which General Yassou had been
                    present, he stayed on for a nightcap. I asked him about it. I said, “From where
                    you sit, General, do you see any threats of rebellion?” He referred to some
                    rather minor flare-ups at the time with the Eritreans, but he said, “That's
                    about all.”</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Laughingly, I said, “General, if you see a threat coming along that you think is
                    likely to succeed, my personal advice to you would be join it and lead it,
                    because if there's going to be one that succeeds, we might have someone like you
                    heading it.”He patted his big tummy and laughed back at me and said, “Look, Mr.
                    Vance, I have no intention of undertaking anything as physically strenuous as
                    that.” Well, let me remind you that General Yassou is the deputy leader of the
                    Eritrean rebellion going on right now. He certainly doesn't have a big tummy at
                    this point.</p>
                <p>The Tigrenian rebellion was headed by President Ras Tafari, who is the head of
                    the Tigre House in the Imperial Dynasty. The Imperial, in Ethiopian history, had
                    been in competition with the House that Haile Selassie belonged to. However, in
                    the time we had come along, peace had been restored. They named the governor
                    general of Tigre, he was given one of the emperor's granddaughters, Princess
                    Aida, as his wife. We visited them in the capital of Tigre with Sam and Mary
                    Gammon, when Sam was consul general in Asmara. Tigre was part of the Asmara
                    consulate district.</p>
                <p>I have seen him twice here in Washington in the last year or so, because he and
                    his son were invited by Mary and Sam Gammon, and just six of us went to the
                    Gammon apartment. Sam suggested that if I had any slides of that visit, I should
                    bring them. I brought them and our projector, then showed him and his son slides
                    of their home in the great old days. Aida had been arrested and incarcerated
                    with her mother and other female members of the royal house for years at that
                    point, so these pictures brought tears.</p>
                <p>Since then, I've been told and have seen in the newspaper that the royal ladies
                    have been released from prison. But the second time I saw him was just about two
                    or three weeks ago. I asked him where Aida was, and he said, “I don't know. They
                    were released, and I haven't heard any more about it.”</p>
                <p>I asked him the first time whether he and the ELF were coordinating their efforts
                    of rebellion, and he said, “Yes, we were. I told the ELF I would be prepared to
                    work out appropriate arrangements, if we won.”</p>

                    sense a lack of adequate food. It was an agricultural country. They seemed to be
                    sustaining a subsistence level, better than a subsistence level, of life. In big
                    cities, there were beggars all over the place, but abject poverty is too strong
                    a word to describe most of what we saw. Certainly no villages were prosperous,
                    but they seemed to be getting along.</p>

                        for some years, urged him to concentrate on agricultural matters. In terms
                        of what you were saying earlier about Haile Selassie, I wonder whether that
                        made sense, in the sense that he was not able to recognize that this was
                        going to be a problem, even though famine had been endemic in Ethiopia for
                        centuries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Famine had been endemic due to climatic up and downs, particularly in the
                    north and west. But I've heard the story that there was this famine in central
                    Ethiopia, and he should certainly have noted that and done something about it,
                    and could have, because he had coped with it earlier in such outbreaks. I think
                    he was beginning to lose touch because he was too old, I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served in Ethiopia as DCM for essentially non-career
                        ambassadors. How did you find your relationship with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: My first ambassador lasted only two weeks, and he was a career man. Then
                    the only other one was Korry, who was not career. Korry was of a journalistic
                    background. Korry tended to leave the running of the embassy and the mission as
                    a whole to me, except for the most important political issues, dealing with the
                    emperor and the prime minister. That he very jealously kept to himself. We got
                    along reasonably well. Korry's ego is pretty enormous, and he did not think that
                    anybody else could be very bright or very capable, but he was willing to leave
                    the sort of nuts-and-bolts management of the mission to me. Rather to my
                    surprise, when I left, I learned that he had raved about me in his efficiency
                    reports, which led to my being considered as having an ambassador
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>He then was assigned to Chile, where he sort of went off his rocker, because he
                    was just obsessed with demonstrating that he had no part of overthrowing Allende
                    Gossens. He just spent the rest of his life trying to prove that and became
                    almost unbalanced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the same Korry, was he not, who was later
                        identified, or maybe during your period, with a rather elaborate thesis on
                        aid?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>VANCE: Oh, yes. That was during my time. He was called back to head up the
                    committee that studied how we should reorganize our aid programs in Africa, and
                    he came up with the idea that there were 50-odd independent countries, and there
                    was a great waste of administrative talent and money running a separate aid
                    mission in each one of these, and a separate aid mission should be continued
                    only for bigger countries, and the smaller ones should have regional
                    programs.</p>
                <p>When I was selected to go to Chad as ambassador, which was one of the smaller
                    ones and no longer had an aid mission, a friend of mine asked me how I expected
                    to be successful dealing with the Chadian Government when I didn't have an aid
                    program. I said, “Well, if an American ambassador could not get the attention of
                    his chief of state with or without an aid program, he ought to be sent back to
                    kindergarten.” Anyway, it was an interesting approach. I think there was some
                    merit, perhaps, to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it from your remarks that living was reasonably
                        comfortable in Ethiopia during the time you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Very. We had a very pleasant house, which I think you're familiar with. We
                    had a good staff of servants, and we had a very interesting and able group of
                    colleagues. The Ethiopians were friendly, and we enjoyed that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure now, however, there must be an element of sadness
                        with regard to your time in Ethiopia, because surely some of the people with
                        whom you had contact or associated with among the Ethiopians . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: Are dead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are either dead as a result of the revolution or in
                        exile.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VANCE: In exile. Exactly. It is very sad. We run into from time to time our
                    friends the Rosenfelds. Chris Rosenfeld was the PAO when we were there. He was
                    instrumental in organizing an association known as Friends of Ethiopia, and
                    everybody reminisces about the great old days and the horrors that have befallen
                    the country now. It is sad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that will conclude our interview today. I want to
                        express my very deep appreciation to Ambassador Vance for a rather lengthy
                        interview, which I found most stimulating and most interesting. We do
                        appreciate it, Sheldon, and thank you very much.</hi>

                <p>VANCE: My pleasure. It was great fun.</p>
