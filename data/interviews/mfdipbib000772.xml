                <p>KARL F. MAUTNER</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Thomas J. Dunnigan </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: May 12, 1993</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Karl, my first question to you is, give me your
                        background. I understand that you were born in Austria and that you were
                        engaged in what I would call political work from your early days and that
                        you were active in opposition to the Nazis. Could you tell us something
                        about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Well, that is an oversimplification. I was born on the 1st of February
                    1915 in Vienna and worked there, went to school there, was a very poor student,
                    and joined the Austrian army in 1935 for a year. In 1936 I got a job as
                    accountant in a printing firm. I certainly couldn't call myself an active
                    opposition participant after the Anschluss. I can't take credit for that...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it is true, is it not, that shortly after Hitler took
                        over Austria, you came to the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Not all that immediately. My brother came right away. He already had
                    legal status because he had lived in the United States before. So he left
                    immediately after Hitler, and soon my sister too. But I had visa problems. I
                    applied a little later and thought I could stick it out; holed up in Hungary
                    where I had wealthy relatives who took me in in April '39. In other words a year
                    after the Nazis had taken over. I left Hungary in February, 1940 and arrived in
                    the United States on the 29th of February, a peculiar date, on a bitter cold day
                    in New York. Then two days later I took out my first papers, and went to work as
                    a baby and dog photographer. Got started with a loan of twenty-five dollars from
                    my sister and the eight dollars I had brought along from Europe. Then I got
                    drafted and inducted on April 3rd, 1941. By that time, I had two hundred
                    fifty-two dollars in the bank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had already made some progress in the new world, I
                        take it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to go back to one question and that was, you talked
                        about getting your visa. Did you actually get it from our Legation in
                        Budapest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: I got it from our Legation in Budapest from Vice Consul Milton
                    Rewinkel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Milton Rewinkel later went on to a distinguished career
                        himself in the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes, I ran into him later on when I myself was an FSO. In February 1940
                    I took a train through Yugoslavia to Italy, got on a ship in Genoa, the “Conte
                    di Savoya.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you arrived in this country. Did you apply for
                        citizenship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes, I applied for my papers the second day after arrival. First day
                    wasn't good because it was icy, a very nasty day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you were drafted in the army, but being a
                        non-citizen, did that in any way interfere with your career in the
                        army?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: No, it didn't. Amazingly not. It helped that I had served in the
                    Austrian army. I was drafted into an infantry unit down in Fort Jackson the 13th
                    regiment. I knew my “right face, left face, about face” business and advanced
                    fairly rapidly to the high rank of corporal, then sergeant, still earning $21 a
                    month. Then I was shipped out as anti-tank platoon sergeant to Bermuda. In
                    Bermuda, we replaced a British territorial battalion. The American infantry
                    battalion went there in this swap for fifty destroyers and a couple of bases in
                    Bermuda, Antigua, Br. Guyana, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Bermuda was your first overseas posting for the United
                        States government, is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: As it were, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Bermuda, and from there where did you
                        go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: Well, first of all, it is quite interesting that I was not a citizen. I
                    had an accent and was a little bit of a boy scout. I was a sergeant in a platoon
                    of pretty tough guys mostly from Kentucky, from the hills, but the uniform, the
                    stripes and evidently something else worked so that I managed my job quite well.
                    I think one of the reasons was that we went out to the shooting range very soon.
                    I was a very good pistol shot having been a hunter in Austria and having shot a
                    lot, and I outshot all those hillbillies. In fact, they had to recount the
                    targets and I had to shoot another set which proved even better, so it
                    established me somehow. But it was an interesting time. I stayed there almost
                    two years, from September '41 to June '43. I couldn't become a citizen in
                    Bermuda because there was nobody to swear me in, otherwise you could become a
                    citizen if you had served one year in the army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we not have a consul in Bermuda then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: I have no idea, but apparently nobody could swear me in. It had to be a
                    judge or a commissioner or something like that. Anyway, my company commander got
                    me a furlough in December 1942 and I went right away with the help of a friend
                    to a judge and got sworn in. When I went back to Bermuda, I was picked for OCS
                    in Fort Benning, in the nicest time of the year in Georgia—July, August,
                    September. After that I was sent to Camp Ritchie which was sort of the
                    intelligence and language center, graduated there in the winter and was shipped
                    out to England in January '44.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a paratrooper by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Not yet. In England I volunteered for the paratroopers with a friend of
                    mine from Vienna, Alfred Diamand, who is a professor in Bloomington, Indiana,
                    probably retired now. When the recruiter came around, we looked at each other
                    and said: “Who shouldn't volunteer but us?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very good. And that made you eligible to jump on D-Day I
                        take it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: That's exactly what it did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you hurt in the landing then on D-Day?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: No, fortunately not. By the way, General Gavin was the one who pinned
                    the wings on me. Shall I tell you a little bit about D-Day?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Well, D-Day, I was pretty far back in the airplane which meant a very
                    short opening of the parachute and I was right away on the ground. As the plane
                    disappeared in one direction, I figured I had to go in the opposite direction
                    because I had no idea where I was. I was in the middle of a field, surrounded by
                    cows, and nobody else around. I started walking and being careful about what I
                    was doing, and about the noise I was making. Then I was challenged by some of
                    our people—we all had those click, click, click things. The password was called:
                    “flash,” and you had to answer: “thunder.” They didn't like the way I pronounced
                    “thunder” and I heard the noise of readied rifles. That was a bit hairy, but one
                    of them eventually recognized me and about five or six of us then wandered in
                    the same direction I had started out, and wound up about eleven a.m. instead of
                    four a.m. in Sainte-Mere-Eglise where we had our designated drop zone and
                    rendezvous site. Then things just went on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You made another jump later in the war, did you not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: In Holland, in Nijmegen. That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you come out of that alright too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: That one was a rather comfortable experience coming down in a nice
                    afternoon on the 17th of September on a soft plowed field. The shooting started
                    only a little bit later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, telescope things until the end of the war. You were
                        with the 82nd when they were our first troops into Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: They weren't really the first troops. The first troops were the 2nd
                    Armored which went in on the 4th of July. They were relieved very shortly after
                    by the 82nd Airborne as an occupation force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now the 82nd Airborne didn't stay there too long, but you
                        did stay. Would you tell us how that happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Well, the 82nd went home in October and let me see. Somebody...one of my
                    friends, Colonel Jim Kaiser...yes, that is where I got tied in with the Foreign
                    Affairs establishment. This is a fairly complicated thing. My sister had a job
                    after she arrived in the United States as a governess for a couple of little
                    girls. They were the daughters of Ed Kellogg, a friend of my brother, who had
                    visited us in Austria.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was later a distinguished Foreign Service
                        officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: He died recently. He eventually became Consul General in Dusseldorf.
                    Great family. So I was a bit acquainted with Ed Kellogg. Somehow, I don't know
                    anymore how, I found out that Ed was in Berlin. I looked him up and he
                    introduced me to some of the people in the State Department offices there. I got
                    acquainted with some of the young ladies there, Joan Clark among them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes, and with Jean Phillips, later married to Merritt Cootes and Frances
                    Nichol, later married to the unforgetable Wendell Blancke, and other Foreign
                    Service people. But prior to this, the 82nd ended the war in Mecklenburg,
                    meeting the Russians there. On the way there, we were hit by a flood of German
                    refugees and soldiers wanting to surrender. Among them were some mounted units
                    in perfect order, every man shaved, even if they were dusty. They were
                    Hungarians. I knew that my old friend Jim Kaiser, Commander of the 3rd Battalion
                    of the 505th, was a horseman, and he was the one I could get on the radio. So, I
                    radioed Kaiser and told him, we got horses here. He said: “Send them over.” So,
                    we were able to separate out a number of horses as well as a Hungarian captain
                    who was a very fine rider and Colonel Kaiser and his friends somehow were able
                    to hang on to those horses and bring them to Berlin. I got into that horsey
                    group because I was a rider and we kept up this friendship. Later, through my
                    acquaintance with those State Department contacts, I introduced Kaiser to the
                    then Military Attach�, Colonel Hohenthal who hired him. In other words, Kaiser
                    stayed, and when the Division left, so did I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he and you stayed behind from the 82nd?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: I decided I'd stay behind too. German speakers were in demand. I had
                    little to gain in the United States. I had no job, no degree or anything, and
                    going on photographing dogs didn't appeal to me too much. Another introduction
                    this whole group developed when one of my sergeants came to Berlin. He was a
                    bassoonist and was looking for a teacher. He found one, a Viennese named
                    Rothensteiner, a bassoonist from a bassoonist family and member of the
                    Philharmonics who also played the piano. Some of the girls wanted to study piano
                    and for some reason asked if I knew anybody to recommend. Rothensteiner was a
                    good piano teacher and so they linked up. That was a great success. They loved
                    him dearly. He was also very good at making “apfelstrudel.” Anyway, that got me
                    even better into this group, and I got acquainted with more and more people whom
                    I found congenial (and vice versa I suppose) in the Berlin Foreign Service
                    establishment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were people in the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: And eventually, the interviewer, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Now, moving on, when you arrived in Berlin, did you
                        think that we would be able to get along with the Russians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the policy of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Partly that. I really thought we would get along. We were still fighting
                    Germans, after all. I remember, we had a couple of rough times in Mecklenburg
                    when we met the Russians. There were great drunken brawls of course and all
                    kinds of things like that but we ignored that. Coming into Berlin I remember
                    clearly seeing that big Russian tank standing on the Potsdamer Chaussee and I
                    remember as we were coming up in a jeep saying: “As long as this stands here,
                    there will be peace.” It was an illusion but that's what we thought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our relationship with the German population at
                        that time in '45?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Well, there was strict non-fraternization, not necessarily
                    needlessly...but it went to the point where it was really pretty absurd—kitchen
                    garbage being doused with gasoline so the Germans wouldn't take it and things
                    like that. They were down to so many calories and weren't supposed to get more
                    than that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We didn't want them to pick up the extra calories from our
                        garbage presumably. Now all this was done while we were setting up a
                        military government for our sector of Berlin. You became acquainted with
                        some people in the State Department. How did the U.S. military government
                        relate to the State Department at that time in Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: I don't really know. I had at first little contact with military
                    government people. The military government I'm talking about is the Berlin
                    Sector, Colonel Howley being Director. OMGUS, the higher headquarters...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OMGUS meaning Office of Military Government United

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes, for Germany. It was a very big headquarters and I didn't really
                    know much what was going on. My own activities concerned mostly screening
                    refugees in a refugee camp and funneling them to people who would interrogate
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were of course looking for senior Nazis,
                        influential or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: That was at the beginning, but it didn't last long because most had left
                    Berlin long ago. Very soon we found out that we weren't getting information of
                    what was going on in the east and we had begun to be interested in what happened
                    there, or our superiors became interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening in the east?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Well, there were tremendous groups and “Trecks” (convoys) of refugees
                    still filtering out of the east in very poor condition, usually, starving
                    children and abused women. We didn't really have a clear picture of what was
                    going on there. We were aware of the fact that the Soviets were just moving
                    everything out, cattle, horses, machines, and everything, and living conditions
                    in the area occupied by them were very bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving it back to the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes. Then, there were rather gruesome stories out of the
                    Polish-administered territories of mistreatment of people, etc. Of course, at
                    the same time all kinds of stories from the German concentration camps were
                    surfacing. So there was still a certain balance in that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, at that time, you were not yet working essentially in
                        what would be called the foreign policy field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Not really, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how did that develop, that you got into the body
                        politic, shall we say, of the Berlin city government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Well, let me see. When the division left, I began working for the
                    military organization G2, Colonel Heimlich...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Intelligence in other words.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes, and did pretty much the same, i.e., interviewing refugees, etc.
                    Then again one of those things where interplay began. We had this riding
                    establishment with Hungarian horses and a couple of captured German horses.
                    Colonel Kaiser and I struck up an acquaintance with Colonel Howley who had a
                    good horse which he acquired somewhere in Germany. So we got acquainted and then
                    sometime in the summer of '46 an Army horseshow team was put together and sent
                    to Switzerland for a tour. It was a haphazard affair, none were top riders and
                    even I got on that team. We went to Geneva and Bern, and performed creditably
                    but not very successfully, with some of those horses we had in Berlin. Our
                    Hungarian instructor came along and it was rather fun. While on that tour,
                    Howley found out that I could get along well in German. He asked me if I wanted
                    to join his staff as liaison officer to the Mayor because he had somebody in the
                    job who didn't speak German, and who was going to go home anyway. I gladly
                    accepted, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you became liaison officer to the Mayor of Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes, but it took a while. There were elections in Berlin on the 20th of
                    October 1946. German-speaking officers were sent out as observers. It was quite
                    interesting. My interest in German politics was high because I was now reading
                    the German newspapers. We had already at that time the Tagespiegel and the Neus
                    Zeitung (which was American-run) both excellent papers. These elections were
                    very important for Berlin and for German-Allied relations.</p>
                <p>But a bit of context, first: in late 1945 the communists in the East had decided
                    to form a merger of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party (SPD),
                    because they thought they weren't going anywhere alone. This forced merger went
                    reasonably smooth in the East with the defection to the communists of SPD leader
                    Otto Grohwohl, but in the West a group—including Franz Neumann, Swolinski,
                    Germer, and others—resisted and were able to force a referendum for all Berlin
                    SPD members which blocked the merger for Berlin. Thus you had in West Berlin an
                    unimpeded SPD. The party continued to function in East Berlin too but under
                    constant severe pressure. In both parts of the city an SED (Socialist Unity
                    Party) emerged as cover for the communists. In the Soviet Zone of Germany, the
                    SED was the unified, merged, communist-dominated existing party.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>The momentous decision of the Berlin SPD against the “merger” showed a great deal
                    of courage. West Berliners often had to attend meetings in East Berlin. They
                    never knew if they would get back safely. Some were abducted, some lost their
                    bicycles which had got them there. It was dangerous to engage in politics not
                    favored by the communists and the Soviets. In my opinion this was the first real
                    eye-opener for many of us, showing us that Berliners had civil courage and were
                    democrats. The October election, thus, became a bitter political struggle for
                    the democratic elements in Berlin and when the non-communist parties won by a
                    great margin our respect for these forces grew.</p>
                <p>Among us election observers were some military German-speakers, mostly from
                    Colonel Heimlich's staff. One of these, Peter Beer, also a paratrooper who had
                    come in with us, was an interesting man. He was born in Vienna, in fact his
                    mother was at the same time a communist city councilor, but he was fiercely
                    opposed to the “merger” in Berlin and very active on his fairly low level (he
                    was a captain) in assisting the SPD, as were others on the lower level.</p>
                <p>I did not have the feeling that our higher echelons were interested in helping
                    one way or the other. It seemed a neutral stance was policy. I may be wrong.
                    Certainly Irving Brown, the CIA/AF of L representative was permitted to engage
                    vigorously in favor of the democratic forces. He was an important man. Our
                    friends needed help. The Soviets supplied the SED with food, cigarettes and
                    transportation and security, and things not readily available for the SPD. The
                    relatively little help they got from our lower level was very important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting to me, if I may interrupt, Karl. Here you
                        talk about our friends and yet this is within a year after they had been our
                        enemies. How did they come to be our friends? Can you comment on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Well, I think I go back to these merger days in early 1946 when it
                    turned out that the German democrats, the leftovers of the Weimar Republic, were
                    people you could rely on to do the right thing. But of course, other things
                    happened in between. The Russians, or the Soviets, were getting more difficult,
                    slowly but surely. We noted that the Russian-appointed city government which the
                    elections were to replace had a mayor who was a total figurehead, an architect
                    name Werner, but the real power was his deputy, Karl Maron, a communist. That
                    same pattern applied throughout the districts the western allies took over.
                    There was always the Moscow installed deputy. The mayors were replaced first but
                    the second in command was harder to remove, elections or no elections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they were the communists, the second men usually?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes, and there was a great deal of obstruction in the labor union field
                    which the communists attempted to dominate also in the West. Slowly the
                    atmosphere had begun to deteriorate. By the time the merger episode had played
                    itself out, I think those of us on the working level had concluded the
                    Berliners, certainly the Social Democrats and also the other democratic parties,
                    could be considered our friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That answers my question in that regard. Our friends were
                        not being helped in the same way that the communists were being helped by
                        the Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Certainly not as massively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that change over time, or did it change?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: You mean did we help them out?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. You referred earlier to the higher levels of our
                        government and at that time that was represented by General Clay who was our
                        military governor in Germany. Was it hard for General Clay to accept
                        socialists since so many of our pre-war army officers had been so
                        conservative in their background and in their pronouncements?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: I don't think so, really. I think General Clay followed pretty much the
                    trends of the time. If you look at his writings and everything else, it seems he
                    was convinced he could get along with the Russians for a long time, until it
                    became clear during the 1947 Moscow conference that things weren't going the way
                    he thought they should, and General Marshall came to the conclusion that we just
                    weren't getting anywhere with the Soviets on an all-German solution, and,
                    therefore we had to stand on our own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the Soviets of course in their sector of
                        Berlin, and the British in passing, but the French were also there. How did
                        the British and French factor in and did they work closely with us in this
                        opposition to the Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: The French actually were quite obstructionist, very difficult. Later on,
                    we came to appreciate their sturdiness. At that time they were just plain
                    difficult. Not that of course we didn't notice as much on our level as on the
                    higher level, the Berlin Kommandatura, and of course the Allied Control
                    Council.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Kommandatura being the governing body for the city of
                        Berlin and the Allied Control Council the governing body for Germany. When
                        did it become clear to you that the Soviets had no intention of agreeing to
                        four-power rule in Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Well, let me go back. After those elections, after the new Magistraat
                    took his seat...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is Magistraat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: The Magistraat was the governing body of Berlin, let's say the cabinet
                    of the mayor running the city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, we should think of that as a Cabinet then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes. First of all, there were three mayors elected at that time. One of
                    them was a Social Democrat, Mr. Ostrowski; second one was a Christian Democrat,
                    Dr. Friedensburg; and the third one was an SED man, Dr. Heinrich Acker. And
                    under them was a cabinet of various functions: finance, building and housing,
                    food and agriculture, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned three mayors. Was one a senior mayor, a
                        governing mayor, or were they all equal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: The senior one was the Social Democrat because the Social Democrats had
                    gained the majority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would have been Ostrowski?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: In fact, was it a majority or a plurality, I'm not quite sure anymore. I
                    think it was a majority.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there was one mayor over the other two? Deputy
                        mayors?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes. One was a bit more than first among equals. Now, you asked before
                    when it became clear that the cooperation was becoming difficult. That was
                    January, '47. That's when I started in the City Hall. Initially, I was nominally
                    the deputy to Colonel Kaiser, because it was a Colonel's job and I was barely a
                    Major then. But Colonel Kaiser left things pretty much to me and was transferred
                    very soon and I took over the job. One of the first things I ran into was of
                    course what I was going to do down there. Kaiser and I had replaced a Lieutenant
                    Colonel who was a very nice man but didn't speak German. He told me when I took
                    over: “Now, don't forget you represent the General who represents the President.
                    You call the mayor and the mayor comes in and you make him stand at attention,
                    etc.” which of course I was able to change very quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're already sliding into the diplomatic way of doing
                        things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Well, there were really very few instructions for me what to do. In my
                    predecessor's view, you just transmitted orders, and that was it. But I very
                    quickly considered the job as something going in both directions and started
                    writing little reports. Somebody would come in the office, maybe Dr.
                    Friedensburg, and would tell me about some development. Then without really
                    understanding very clearly what was behind the things he told me, the intrigues,
                    and machinations, I wrote it down and reported it to Colonel Howley. That in
                    turn irritated people in Colonel Howley's political section, Captain Biel
                    especially, whose prerogative it was to cover this kind of thing and he
                    confronted me. I was smart enough to gang up with him from that time on because
                    he knew much more about the local scene, and we became good friends, and still
                    are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dr. Biel never doubted his own ability as I recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: By the way, I remember an incident that is of interest. It was in
                    August, I believe, the 21st or 22nd of August 1945 and I think it was the first
                    concert of the Philharmonic after the Americans had moved into Berlin. It took
                    place in the Titania Palace in the American sector, an old movie theater which
                    served as a concert hall. The conductor was a young man named Borchard. I
                    believe he was a White Russian. His sister, by the way, Madame Kudriavzev, had
                    served for many years as a receptionist in the American Embassy in Berlin.
                    Unfortunately, Borchard lived in the British sector, and somebody who had a car
                    took him back into the British sector. In those days we still had border guards
                    between the American and British sector and the U.S. border guard tried to stop
                    him. But the car did not halt and the guard shot and killed Borchard. It was of
                    course most unfortunate. It was a man from the 82nd Airborne Division. General
                    Gavin was called on the carpet and was asked what happened. “Well, I taught my
                    people to shoot and kill and why do we have those stupid borders between the
                    British and American sectors anyway. Let's eliminate them.” And from that day on
                    they were abolished.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A point of interest. Were there still border guards
                        between the British and French sectors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: I don't think they continued after that incident.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the only border guards would have been between the
                        three western sectors and the Soviet sector?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes, but I don't really remember if anybody was stopped in those days on
                    these borders, but it could be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was an unfortunate incident, but I gather from then
                        on there were many incidents that happened, but generally it involved
                        Germans and Soviets, or westerners and Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes, but fortunately, not as prominent people as Mr. Borchard. By the
                    way, you might be interested to know that I was able to save the Philharmonics
                    more or less because Mr. Rothensteiner needed reeds for his bassoon section. The
                    Russians had used his supply for fire kindling. He tried to get some through the
                    military government and the ones our music officer got him weren't flexible
                    enough and didn't work. When I went on a skiing vacation to Switzerland early in
                    1946, he gave me an address where I could get some reeds, and I brought back
                    enough to keep the bassoonists functioning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the reeds section of the Philharmonic was saved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes. Interesting that we had a “music officer”, presumably in order to
                    teach the Germans how to play Beethoven.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the meanwhile you were encountering increasing problems
                        in your job as liaison with the city government. Not so much with the
                        Germans as with the obstructions from the Soviets, I gather, to what the
                        western powers wanted to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: We were talking about the Ostrowski crisis, I think. Ostrowski was the
                    elected Social Democratic mayor. He was a big tall, rather impressive looking
                    man with a bald Mussolini like head but he called himself “neither an Ostrowski
                    nor a Westrowski”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A pun on the German East-West division.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes. Of course it didn't go down too well because in the meantime it was
                    quite clear that the Social Democrats sided with the west, whereas the SED, a
                    minority party, sided with the east. So the Social Democrats voted him out of
                    office for consorting with the SED, saying, “You are no longer our mayor, our
                    representative at the Magistraat,” and voted in Ernst Reuter in his stead. That
                    brought on a real crisis because Reuter had been a prominent communist in the
                    1917 revolutionary days. He had been a prisoner of war with the Russians since
                    1914.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the First World War.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes. He had even helped establish the Volga German Republic in the
                    Soviet Union. Then disillusioned with the Bolsheviks, he came back to Germany,
                    and eventually joined the Social Democrats. He became a very successful
                    transportation expert. For example, in Greater Berlin, he was instrumental in
                    getting the U-bahn and the S-bahn coordinated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The U-bahn being the subway and the S-bahn being the above
                        ground rapid railway?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Then he became mayor of Magdeburg. In the Nazi days, he was for a while
                    in a concentration camp, then emigrated to Turkey where he taught in the
                    university in Ankara. After the war he was induced to come back to Germany,
                    arriving in Berlin right after the elections of the new Magistraat. In April, he
                    was elected to succeed Ostrowski. That created a crisis situation, because the
                    Soviets insisted he could not become mayor unless his election was approved by
                    the Kommandatura. That required a unanimous four-power vote and they were not
                    willing to endorse him. It went back and forth. I don't remember the details
                    anymore, but although we kept insisting that an election is an election and we
                    needn't approve this kind of elected high official, the Russians were adamant.
                    It moved up to the Control Council level and I think a “compromise” was reached.
                    In other words, we just relented, and Reuter was not made mayor. Louise
                    Schroeder, a Social Democrat, was moved up instead as Acting Mayor. I'd like to
                    talk about her later. So the city struggled along. Reuter was really de facto
                    mayor. He ran a lot of the show, but he was not acknowledged as the mayor. That
                    was one of the first overt signs of problems with the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the city, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: In the meantime, things kept getting a little more difficult. There were
                    incidents of obstruction on the scrap iron front. The railway system throughout
                    Berlin was under the control of the east, and suddenly unauthorized trains of
                    scrap iron started moving out of West Berlin into East Berlin and things like
                    that. There was constant interference by the previously appointed communist
                    underlings in the functioning of various cabinet departments. Very difficult
                    situations arose in the case of the education department where an old-time
                    communist was the number two man, Wildangel, who spoke French and therefore was
                    also favored by the French, as well as the Russians. Another elected official
                    named Nestriepke couldn't get anything done in his department and was constantly
                    attacked by the Russians in the Kommandatura. There was one day when we had a
                    new Commandant General, Cornelius Ryan...Howley, mind you, was director of the
                    military government of Berlin, but only later became Commandant, a two-star job.
                    Until then, he was deputy to the Commandant who was appointed by General Clay.
                    General Ryan came from the military government side throughout the war. A very
                    nice man. He acquitted himself well later in the McCarthy days but he was really
                    not up to the problems that arose in Berlin. One day in a Kommandatura meeting I
                    happened to attend, the Russian brought up another of his usual charges about
                    some bad things one or another of the Social Democratic elected cabinet members
                    had done. In this case, it was Dr. Nestriepke, who was the education counselor.
                    He had allegedly done something the Russians considered insubordination.
                    Whereupon General Ryan suddenly spoke up and said: “Then I'll propose we dismiss
                    the man.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Without inquiring into the details?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes. Well, details were given by the Russian. But the British had a new
                    General Herbert who wasn't really quite sure what was going on and the French
                    didn't like Nestriepke, they favored Wildangel because he had lived in France.
                    So, bingo, suddenly Nestriepke was dismissed. Howley was there tearing his hair
                    and we were all upset.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The decision had been made.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: The decision had been made. There were all kinds of things of that
                    nature. In the Kommandatura one day the Soviets complained that Reuter, who was
                    in charge of public utilities, had distributed ration cards number one to his
                    friends. Ration cards came in five classes. One was for heavy workers, top
                    artists, and the like. Two, a little less good, was for government officials and
                    so down the line to five which was just about starvation level for nobodies like
                    housewives and widows. In our military government, German employees got one
                    ration level higher than they normally would have gotten under the German
                    regulations. Now, there was only a limited number of class one ration cards
                    available, and the Soviets accused Reuter of having favored some of his
                    political friends with them. So Reuter was called on the carpet by the public
                    utilities officer. We in the Kommandatura had a very nice man in public
                    utilities who ran a gas company in Kansas but was not terribly up to snuff in
                    international politics. Reuter, however, was very articulate and spoke good
                    English. He explained that he had taken away ration cards giving more household
                    gas and electricity to prominent communists who had not contributed anything to
                    the city's functioning and given them to people who were working hard as
                    officials of the gas company. That saved Reuter from being censored.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Incidents like that make you wonder how people keep their
                        temper at times and their good sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes. Well you yourself remember some of the things at the Kommandatura.
                    It was not an easy battling ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, we are of course coming on to the approach to the
                        blockage period of June '48. There was a bit of a build-up which I'm sure
                        you'll recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Well, let me see. Already in the fall of '47 there was an indication of
                    problems ahead. Suddenly, during a rainy period, a whole big load of potatoes
                    were dumped at one of the American sector railway stations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Potatoes destined for all of Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: It was a delivery from the east of an agreed-upon allocation. But the
                    next day you saw in the Taegliche Rundschau, the Soviet-sponsored German paper,
                    that “Americans are neglecting the feeding of Berlin, they let potatoes rot in
                    the rain.” The east had not notified anybody the shipment was coming, and no
                    storage space was readily available—everything was bombed out. Meanwhile the
                    food councilor, under tremendous pressure by one of his communist deputies, came
                    to me wailing that we had to do something to get those things stored away. (His
                    name was Fullsack, by the way.) There was a big empty factory-type building in
                    the American sector which was requisitioned by the U.S. Army but not being used.
                    Can I get that for him quickly? I went to Howley, who immediately was very
                    forthcoming. We got it the next day and moved the potatoes, which were very
                    important for feeding of Berlin. That kind of thing happened more often.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Devilish tricks, in other words?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes, little things here, little things there, and gradually getting more
                    difficult to handle. There was a blockade of postal deliveries to Berlin, with
                    the East press claiming the Soviet zone being “impoverished and sucked out” by
                    the west by smuggling, etc. Nothing could go into the west by parcel post. It
                    was also blocked from going to West Germany for a while. At first the Allied
                    reaction was that this was something for the Germans to handle, which of course
                    it wasn't, and it began to build up, more and more. In the chapter on Berlin I
                    wrote a book titled “Witnesses to the Origins of the Cold War,” I went into more
                    detail about those things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These pinpricks kept getting worse until the breakup of

                <p>MAUTNER: The Control Council broke up on the 20th of March, 1948. I think the
                    Soviets concluded after the 1947 Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow, that
                    they were not going to get their way in all of Germany. They began to work in
                    the direction of two Germanies. Well, it's a very difficult judgement call.
                    There are always people who say that it was our fault that Germany was split
                    apart. I think it was our fault, only in that we didn't give in to the Soviet
                    demands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's called revisionism, I believe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes, revisionists make a strong case, but I think they are wrong.
                    Looking back, I think the turning point of our attitude toward Germany and our
                    relations with the Soviets dates from the speech in Stuttgart by Secretary of
                    State Byrnes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was September 1946?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: October or September, yes. That was when it became clear that western
                    interests in that part of Germany, where the West had influence, had to be
                    maintained. But how this worked out on the higher level, of course, is another
                    story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You pointed out that two key events on the diplomatic
                        front, Secretary of State Byrnes's speech in Stuttgart in 1946 and Secretary
                        Marshall's visit to Moscow in early 1947, were turning points in determining
                        our policy towards Germany after the war. How did you see these things being
                        reflected at your level, that is in the Berlin city government? And another
                        question: tell us what you can about the lead-up to the famous Berlin
                        Blockade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Well, I don't think we saw much of anything reflected from the Byrnes
                    visit and the Foreign Ministers' meeting on our immediate low-level
                    activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Russians didn't change their policies? They didn't
                        become any more difficult?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: They were difficult already. There were always difficulties about West
                    Germany—the Berlin transport lines. At first, of course coming to Berlin was no
                    problem for the allied forces. We simply showed an ID card at the border and
                    moved on. Later there had to be travel orders; then they had to be translated
                    and it got more and more complicated. Some people called it “salami tactics”;
                    others disagreed, saying it was just better organization of the various
                    administrative problems. The Germans at first could move reasonably freely
                    between the sectors into the zones, but that didn't last very long. They were
                    always subject to searches and roadblocks and “requisition” of whatever they
                    were carrying. Then they needed all kinds of “propusks” (passes) to go from
                    place to place, and movement became increasingly difficult. They practically
                    could not cross the zone border without proper permission. There would be
                    various meetings in the west zone, let us say meetings of the Germany-wide CDU
                    party with Adenauer presiding, and the Berlin CDU people had trouble getting
                    there, and it was even more difficult for the east zone CDU members. There were
                    minister president meetings and similar kinds of things and attendance got
                    increasingly difficult. Then came another of the postal blockades I alluded to,
                    it was some time in January 1948. Suddenly, mail to West Germany piled up in the
                    American sector train station (which was controlled by the East German
                    (Reichsbahn) and Soviet supervision with the East claiming the Americans were
                    trying to censor the mail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we censoring the mail or was there no truth
                        whatsoever in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: No. Then, autobahn trouble started. We and the British had aid stations
                    half way down the autobahn to Helmstedt to aid our own motorists. The Soviets
                    ordered them closed down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The autobahn going through the Soviet zone of
                        Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes. Then they would arbitrarily stop vehicles in the middle of the
                    autobahn. Car travel became more and more unpleasant.</p>
                <p>On top of that, the Soviet claimed the bridge over the Elbe at Magdeburg had to
                    be repaired, and closed it to auto traffic. (By the way, that bridge had been
                    built by the U.S. Army engineers toward the end of the war and was still in use
                    until the 1970s.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the one bridge on the autobahn that was
                        absolutely essential to get to the west.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes. Later on came incidents with the allied trains. The Soviets
                    demanded the right to inspect them and we refused. After going back and forth on
                    this, the Soviets would relax a little bit and let some trains through but kept
                    coming back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But both of these on the rail and in regard to the road,
                        these were in violation of the four-power agreements?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Where were they, the four-power agreements? Apparently there weren't any
                    really, because the only detailed written agreement about access was for air
                    traffic where the Air Traffic Committee of the Control Council agreed to three
                    air corridors and a twenty-two mile circle around the air traffic Control Center
                    of Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think the rail and road arrangements were bilateral
                        agreements between military commanders to assure access when we took over
                        Berlin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes, the arrangements for access were never made formal agreements
                    because General Clay somewhat defensively claimed later that he understood that
                    it was a matter of word of honor and self-understood. He said that the right was
                    implied by the fact that we were in Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, there were these transport problems in getting into
                        Berlin, but was it not the currency conversion actually that triggered the
                        blockade?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: I think it was in a way true, although the Russian commandant, General
                    Kotikov, walked out of a Kommandatura meeting before the currency reform and
                    before the actual beginning of the blockade. If I am not mistaken, it was the
                    20th of June. That was an endless Kommandatura meeting, lasting sixteen hours or
                    so. Howley got tired and turned the meeting over to his deputy, Colonel Babcock,
                    and Kotikov seized on this as an insult and said, “If the Americans don't
                    cooperate, I'll walk out,” and left. That was the end of the four-power
                    Kommandatura. Of course, talks about possible currency reform were already going
                    on, but more on the Control Council level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For all of Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: For all of Germany. Not about Berlin. I came under pressure from Mayor
                    Reuter and city treasurer Haas, both of whom said: “We know something is coming
                    and we don't know the exact details, but we have a very good idea. Make sure
                    that your chief (that was Howley) gets Berlin included. Otherwise we'll go down
                    the drain.” So I went to Howley who said: “They don't know anything, and I don't
                    know anything; we're not supposed to know anything.” Those working on the
                    currency reform were completely sequestered, not allowed to talk to anyone. When
                    introduced, the currency reform applied only in west Germany. What really
                    persuaded Clay and the other military governors to include soon Berlin shortly
                    thereafter, I don't know. But it didn't take very long. Berlin got the Westmark
                    with a B stamp on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With a B for Berlin on it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes. They were shipped in by plane. The Soviets did not allow the
                    circulation of B marks in East Berlin or East Germany. I suspect we were quite
                    happy about that because it would have siphoned off the good marks and brought
                    in the east marks from the zone. Anyhow, with that, all traffic into Berlin from
                    the west, except allied air traffic, stopped. The day was the 26th of June. At
                    first, General Clay concluded that the allied forces could be supplied by air
                    but for a while it was thought that the city population could be supplied by
                    air.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there were about two million people living in West
                        Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: About two million. It quickly became evident Berlin could no longer get
                    electricity or food from the East anymore. Clay saw something had to be done and
                    started an impromptu airlift with old C-47s (DC 3s) to bring in some food and
                    other essentials. That airlift steadily expanded and turned into an enormous
                    operation. I had no idea until much later what an effort on the national level
                    it required, what organization. General Tunner, I think, was the organizational
                    genius. In the end one plane every two minutes came to West Berlin.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Tunner was in Wiesbaden, as I recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: General LeMay was one who inspired this...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Washington, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes. And General Clay who pushed it through Washington at the War
                    Department—I think it was still the War Department, or was it already the
                    Defense Department, I don't remember, there was great hesitation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was the War Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: There was great reluctance in some quarters because it was thought that
                    Berlin was indefensible. But Clay was really at his best at that time and
                    insisted. Truman backed him up and we had an airlift. The airlift was one of the
                    few clear cut victories we had in that era.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Karl, if I may refer to something you said a few minutes
                        ago, when you referred to Mayor Reuter. But earlier you'd said that he
                        didn't become mayor because the Soviets had vetoed him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: That is quite right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Well, the fall of 1948 was a peculiar time. The acting mayor was Louise
                    Schroeder, a remarkable woman. She was frail, very small, but she had been
                    trained in the old Social Democratic school of speaking to the public without a
                    microphone. She had a voice that carried a Hall and she was astute and capable.
                    Although she was frequently ill, she ran the city quite well. We liaison
                    officers once had a luncheon meeting with her. We brought her some food, a care
                    package or so. The Russians came with a fish. I think they had a carp wrapped up
                    in a Pravda, but anyway it was one of the last joint affairs...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A fresh fish from the Russians and a care package from the
                        U.S.?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes. I don't remember whether it was at her place or at Dr. Suhr's,
                    chairman of the city assembly. Anyway, she was great, but of course the real
                    mayor, the elected mayor was still Reuter. In the meantime, the pressure
                    intensified on those elected officials in the east sector continued...don't
                    forget that Berlin City Hall was in the east sector. The deputies to the
                    assembly were eventually chased out of the assembly hall, by communist goon
                    squads and east-controlled police. So they moved the assembly to the West Sector
                    into the Technical University building, at that time unheated and unpleasant,
                    but at least a safe haven. Then pressure built up on the food distribution
                    office and food councilor Fullsack had to move west. After him, the public
                    utilities man had to move because the Russians installed their own “liaison man”
                    to run that operation. The elected mayors in the East Berlin districts were
                    pushed out after being accused of inefficiency—because they couldn't deliver
                    coal which they didn't have, and this kind of thing. By the time December came
                    around...now wait a minute, there is something else. Before the blockade while
                    it was still in action the Kommandatura had decided that there should be
                    elections in all of Berlin in December...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be in 1948 then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: December, 1948. A new constitution was drafted by the city assembly, and
                    delivered to the Kommandatura on schedule, but only recognized and okayed by the
                    three western powers. The Soviets refused to recognize it because it made no
                    provisions for socialization and other kinds of things they wanted. The three
                    commandants nevertheless decided that the elections should take place and
                    approached the Soviets about it. They refused to allow elections in December in
                    their sector. The western commandants, in this case the French, very astutely
                    decided to go ahead in the west sectors regardless. Those elections were to take
                    place on the 5th of December with an open invitation to the Soviets to permit
                    voting in their sector too. But, before the 5th of December, I think it was
                    December 2, the Soviet sector arranged a monster rally in one of their theaters,
                    the Admiral Palast, of the so-called mass organizations, of course all
                    communists. The FDGB, the workers organizations, etc., and the participants
                    “elected” a Mayor and assembly by acclamation.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: And the political parties too, which by then were pretty well under
                    Soviet control. They decided to dismiss the existing mayors and elect their own
                    Lord Mayor, and that was Fritz Ebert, the son of Friedrich Ebert, the former
                    Social Democratic President of Germany in 1918.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this meant two governments in one city, is that
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Well, it became that way rapidly. Now, Fritz Ebert was an alcoholic and
                    not very useful, but he was made mayor. His deputy was Karl Mason, the old
                    Moscow-trained hand. We liaison officers were still based in the city hall
                    downtown, but things were beginning to crumble because most of the city
                    councilors or the cabinet ministers had already left. On December 2nd when Ebert
                    was elected, the communist authorities moved him to City Hall and we couldn't do
                    anything about it because they had physical control with their police. So we got
                    the then legitimate acting mayor, Dr. Friendensburg, to come down the next
                    morning (he lived in the West) and claim his office. We were all there; my
                    British colleague, Colonel Whiteford, Captain Ziegelmaier from the French, and
                    myself. Friedensburg arrived in his somewhat ramshackle car and tried to walk
                    into the City Hall, but was stopped by the East guards. He said: “I am the
                    mayor.” They said: “No you're not.” He responded with, “I yield to force,” and
                    went back home. We witnessed the exchange and prepared to move out of City Hall
                    as well. The British ran into a lot of trouble moving their office because they
                    apparently had no receipts for their furniture. We had legitimate receipts for
                    ours and knew where it had come from. There was a very interesting janitor on
                    the scene, a man named Mittag, who had kept track of everything on the premises
                    and of course turned the records over to the communists. So, we had a moving out
                    party out of the City Hall December 3.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of which was taking place within the Soviet
                        sector?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: All of this taking place within the Soviet sector, on the 2nd and 3rd of
                    December.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the blockade”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: During the blockade, before the elections, yes. Now, Howley said, “if
                    they want to block you, you run them down with your car.” Well fortunately they
                    were blocking with a big truck, so I couldn't run them down. But anyway it was
                    quite an exodus, I still have a picture from the New York Times of Whiteford,
                    Ziegelmaier and myself. Howley put me back in uniform, made me a Major again. We
                    moved to where the Assembly was meeting in West Berlin with whatever we got
                    out...our files, etc. The British also had a hard time getting their files out
                    but I got mine out intact. Then we set up the Liaison Offices in the West. The
                    elections took place only in West Berlin on the 5th of December. The SPD won a
                    flat majority, some 52% of the vote. With that the Commandants recognized Reuter
                    as mayor. West Berlin then had a real elected government: Reuter, Lord Mayor,
                    with Friedensburg deputy. The “Magistraat” now had become a “Senat” because
                    Berlin according to that new constitution was now a “Land” and the “Lord Mayor”
                    became “Governing Mayor”.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in a sense Reuter had been elected mayor of Berlin
                        twice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Twice, before taking his seat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that was a long digression on Mayor Reuter, but
                        since he was such a key figure during these blockade months, I thought it
                        would be useful to find out how he finally took his position. Now how did
                        your job change when you moved into the western sector of Berlin, and
                        specifically during this blockade period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: It didn't change that much, because the job I had was really tailor-made
                    to whatever was required. It became more one of listening to good advice. Reuter
                    was an extremely astute man, very intelligent, and obviously a leadership
                    figure, and he had many, many suggestions to make. By that time, the military
                    government people, especially on our side, were very willing to listen to him.
                    Clay had already made contact and respected him and Howley, of course, too.
                    Howley was a very interesting man, a real Irishman. He had quite a temperament.
                    He had right-leaning views but was very, very sensitive to popular moods and had
                    good political instincts. He knew Reuter was the man to rely on, and the
                    Berliners liked Reuter and relied on him, so the Social Democrats were okay with
                    Howley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, Reuter and Howley got along?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Absolutely, yes. There was a very momentous day in 1948, September 9,
                    played a role. When the currency reform was discussed in Moscow during the
                    summer, there was some tendency on the part of Americans to give in and relax
                    the absolute demand to have the westmark in West Berlin. And I think actually
                    that Bedell Smith (our Ambassador in Moscow) at that time was ready to give in
                    on that point. The matter was referred back to the Control Council on Germany
                    which began to meet again on that issue in the Control Council building in
                    Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After six months with no meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: Six months or more than that, with no meetings. That of course got
                    Berliners quite upset. Reuter was quite adamant, insisting that, “If you give up
                    the Bmark, we are gone. They'll swallow us up like a sausage.” The authorities
                    convoked a massive rally down in front of what is today the rebuilt Reichstag.
                    How did the crowd get there? Transport was extremely poor. You had to walk
                    endlessly because there was no electricity, and few streetcars. Yet some three
                    hundred thousand people showed up. Reuter and Neuman spoke, and leaders from the
                    other parties, too.</p>
                <p>Tape II</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On September 9, 1948, there was a big demonstration
                        against the blockade. What was your feeling at that time? Could the
                        Berliners stick it out? Did you feel that this demonstration showed that the
                        Berliners were willing to suffer and carry on their life during the
                        blockade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes. That's a little bit of a leading question, but I am quite sure that
                    was the case, because the demonstrators wanted to show that the Berliners led by
                    Ernst Reuter did not want the currency issue to become a vehicle for turning
                    them over to the east. They wanted to show the allied authorities that they were
                    willing to hold out even though the coming winter would mean hardships, and that
                    they trusted the airlift and the western allies, especially the Americans. They
                    heard ringing speeches by Reuter, Ernst Lemmer, Neuman. I think Irving Brown
                    spoke, too. (Irving Brown was representative of the AFL/CIO and a very important
                    figure in supporting the free trade union movement in Berlin and Germany.) They
                    then endorsed a document which asserted that Berlin was prepared to hold out no
                    matter how tough the times and marched to the nearby Control Council to present
                    it. Their action stiffened the backs of the three western allies against any
                    sellout of Berlin. It was a very decisive moment I am convinced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the three western commandants. What was
                        their role during this period of the blockade, because you indicated that
                        Mayor Reuter was a strong figure himself and apparently was taking more
                        power unto himself and to the Germans. What role did the allies play in
                        this? Were the commandants helpful?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: The commandants were certainly helpful. Reuter wasn't even mayor in the
                    beginning, but he was certainly a dominating and dominant figure, through his
                    personality, his intellect, and also through his reputation. The commandants by
                    that time had begun to consult with Reuter quite frequently. The commandants
                    were in a way the local rulers, and it must be pointed out that the French who
                    were generally not very helpful on the Control Council, were very good in Berlin
                    and were in favor of holding out. There was this incident with General Ganeval
                    who decided to blow up a radio tower in his sector which interfered with air
                    access and was controlled by the Russians. General Ganeval was important in
                    permitting the construction of Tegel airfield, which was a miracle anyway
                    because it involved building an enormous airfield out of a wasteland using
                    mostly hand tools, and not terribly efficient earth moving equipment, because
                    modern machines were too big to be easily flown in by air.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that airport Tegel finished in time to play a role in
                        the blockade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes, it definitely played a role. We had otherwise only Tempelhof and
                    Gatow which were barely adequate for that purpose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tempelhof in the American sector, and Gatow in the British
                        sector. And then Tegel which was in the French sector?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: That's right, although Tegel was not quite fully operational, but the
                    very existence of it was important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the fact that the French General would blow up a
                        Soviet radio tower to make the airport possible.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes, it was a radio transmitter for the Russian-controlled news station.
                    Those things were very important. They showed the Berliners that the allies were
                    with them. The Berliners had become friends, that was quite obvious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, we know from history that the blockade was
                        successful, that it ended in May 1949, and that Berlin settled into a new
                        and freer life closely attached to the Federal Republic which by this time
                        was becoming a force. Were there close links between West Berlin and the
                        Federal Republic? How did the constitutional situation develop there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: First of all, the Federal Basic Law, which was more or less a
                    constitution, contained various articles, I don't recall them exactly anymore,
                    that stated Berlin is a land of the Federal Republic. Some of those were
                    considered not quite compatible with the Four-Power status by the allies and
                    were suspended when the Federal Basic Law went into effect. It all took place
                    after the end of the blockade May 12, 1949. The relationship between Berlin and
                    the Federal Government was of course at that time still a little less close as
                    it later became. Although Mayor Reuter...don't forget Mayor Reuter became mayor
                    of all Berlin, nominally, but effectively of West Berlin on December 5, 1948. He
                    pushed very much for actual inclusion of Berlin as a “land”, i.e. a state of the
                    Federal Republic. At that time, it was a talk of Berlin as the eleventh land of
                    the FRG.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The land of the Federal Republic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes. Berlin in the meantime had itself become a land, i.e. a state, and
                    the Lord Mayor had become the Governing Mayor through that new Berlin
                    constitution recognized by the western allies, but it was only to a limited
                    extent a part of the Federal Republic. Berlin took over federal laws by a
                    separate legislative act. Some federal laws were not permitted or were suspended
                    in part by the allies, partly at the federal level and partly also at the
                    Kommandatura level.</p>
                <p>Now, Reuter's personality played of course a tremendous role, as did the
                    personality of the higher leading persons in Germany from now on. The allies
                    were fortunate to have people who could run the show, and the allies were also
                    unusually intelligent enough to let them run the show. We had Reuter who knew
                    the city in and out, and had the confidence of the population, and very
                    fortunately spoke excellent English and excellent French and thereby was able to
                    deal one on one with his allied partners, and really by his personality
                    dominated the scene. Sometimes his push to get Berlin closer to the Federal
                    Republic earned him rebuke. But running the place and making major decisions
                    about how to advance the fortunes of the city, that was really left to him. We
                    had people like Howard Jones, our economic counselor, who was bright enough to
                    rely on the excellent people Reuter had brought back to Berlin. For example,
                    people like Paul Hertz who was an emigre. He was once a Reichstag deputy and
                    then emigrated to America and was in his sixties. Reuter brought him back
                    because he was an excellent finance and economics expert. Howard Jones and most
                    of the allies relied very much on Hertz's capability and let him run the
                    economy. This is terribly important and also links in with the whole Marshall
                    plan business because of the fact that we found excellent managers we could rely
                    on and who could administer the American funded programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Although their personalities were far different, it seems
                        to me that Adenauer in West Germany played about the same dominant role
                        vis-a-vis the high commissioners that Reuter did with the commandants of
                        Berlin. A powerful personality could do what he wanted.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: Well, he couldn't do everything he wanted, but he could accomplish a lot
                    because he had capability and a persuasive personality.</p>
                <p>Now, Adenauer was a different man. He was far more scrappy, far more powerful in
                    many ways, and had the good fortune to have somebody like Mr. McCloy there who
                    trusted him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, as West Berlin recovered from the blockade, what was
                        the situation in Western Germany which had its own government? Were there
                        any links between West Berlin and East Berlin? Were there any attempts to
                        get the city together again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: I don't think there were many links at all. There was certainly no
                    official contact on any level. There may have been on the lower level contacts,
                    but I doubt it. There were of course a few, mostly Social Democratic deputies to
                    the city assembly in the West who still lived in the east sector and who
                    represented the east sector in the west sector parliament. Their luck ran out
                    fairly soon however. They had to move into the west and that's about the size of
                    the contacts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, the conditions improved in West Berlin and
                        did not really improve in East Berlin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: No, they didn't improve there. There were some vast building projects on
                    the so-called Frankfurter Allee which was renamed Stalin Allee. They built some
                    typical Stalinist housing projects along the Allee for show. They built this
                    enormous war memorial. In general I think the city was administered strictly on
                    the Stalinist model. The big tensions arose on really serious east-west
                    problems. Occasionally there were kidnappings. I remember the case of Dr. Linse
                    who ran a western-oriented lawyers' organization that radiated out into the
                    east. His Kidnappings involved the KGB. It was a dirty cold war at that time.
                    One of the really visible signs of the tension was the flow of refugees from the
                    east to the west. They came through Berlin because access to West Berlin was
                    still free. All they had to do was get on the S-bahn in East Berlin and go into
                    West Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean they could come from east Germany, the Soviet
                        zone, right into West Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: They could come from the eastern zone into East Berlin, get on the
                    S-bahn and come over. There were occasional attempts to stop them on the part of
                    the east police, but in general there was a fairly free flow into West Berlin.
                    At times there were great masses coming in whenever the pressure increased. With
                    the political pressure for example to increase the work norms in the factories,
                    and other hardships, collectivization of the farms, more people came out of the
                    east and flowed into the west. West Berlin established refugee camps. People
                    were screened to determine whether they were really refugees and then usually
                    flown out to West Germany because they couldn't travel on the autobahn which was
                    controlled by the east. That thing built up to the very high degree in early
                    1953 when again the pressure on the part of the eastern communists had
                    increased. They needed higher production. They increased the production norms
                    and didn't increase the rations pay or anything else. That culminated in a big
                    blow-up on June 16 and 17 when the East German workers, especially in the
                    Hennigsdorf steel plant north of Berlin went on strike. They marched into East
                    Berlin, demonstrated there vigorously. As Russian tanks moved in, they threw
                    rocks at them. It was quite a show. Eventually of course it was quashed with
                    brute force. We now know several hundred died. The demonstration extended into
                    various localities in the eastern zone, such as Magdeburg. The 17th of June 1953
                    is also one of the landmarks of some importance. In fact, in West Germany it
                    became a holiday, although the revolt was put down. Now, we had very interesting
                    allied reactions on that. They were not terribly good, because there were some
                    officials perturbed because the Germans revolted against an allied power.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though it was the Russians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Even though it was the Soviets against whom the workers rebelled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this reflected in the attitude of Americans, French,
                        or British in Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes. At the commandants level where there were relatively new people, it
                    was reflected in reactions like, “Got to be careful that we don't have a revolt
                    spilling over into our part of the city.” It was not a very nice situation. It
                    was also made more difficult because Mayor Reuter happened to be out of town on
                    that day. He was at an international Social Democratic rally in Austria and it
                    became an urgent matter to get him back to Berlin as quickly as possible because
                    the acting Mayor was an FDP man, Dr. Conrad, an inadequate substitute,
                    indeed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: FDP. What was FDP?</hi>
                </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the liberal-right-wing conservative group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes. It was sort of a mixture of old fashioned liberals and right
                    wingers, a funny combination. Dr. Conrad represented the mayor, he was a deputy
                    mayor who was in charge at that time. Dr. Conrad was not a terribly effective or
                    competent man. He was a nice person but that was about it. There wasn't too much
                    confidence in him on the part of the allies or anybody else. They wanted Reuter
                    back. But it required special permission to fly him home on a military aircraft,
                    to get him on a British military aircraft flying out of Klagenfurt, I believe.
                    But they refused to make that exception, so it took practically two days to get
                    Reuter back and that was quite damaging. There were such problems as West Berlin
                    Social Democrats calling for a protest rally in Kreuzberg which would have been
                    a big rally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kreuzberg is in the American sector?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: In the American sector, yes. The American commandant refused permission
                    although the police president, Dr. Stumm, a Social Democrat, said it was
                    perfectly safe to have it. There were on the commandants' level fears that it
                    might spill over into the east sector and cause a lot of trouble. Anyway, the
                    mood was not as good as it should have been, and that was especially noticeable
                    at the memorial ceremony for some West Berliners who had been killed in the
                    revolt in East Berlin. It was at the City Hall, the Freedom Bell rang. The
                    Kommandatura decided not to have the allied commandants present in uniform
                    because that might give too much weight to the fact that the allies approved of
                    this whole business. It was a typical reaction. Anyway, Cecil Lyon, our
                    political advisor to our commandant, permitted my wife and me to take his state
                    limousine with the American flag and we participated in the funeral procession
                    and people thought this was a good show for the Americans. There was also an
                    incident at the funeral commemorative ceremony in the City Assembly hall (the
                    House of Representatives). There were two conspicuously empty seats where the
                    British and the French liaison officers usually sat. I was there. I think this
                    caused some comment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The British and the French weren't there under orders from
                        their commandants, I assume?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: I assume under instructions, I don't know. Anyway, that shows the mood
                    then.</p>
                <p>Here I must mention RIAS (Radio in the American Sector) which had great influence
                    in East Germany. The man in charge was Gordon Ewing. He had the responsibility
                    of telling the people in the East what was going on. He could have been
                    incendiary and start a blood bath. He received no guidance from his superiors in
                    Bonn, nor in Berlin. He was able to draw on the wise (and informal) guidance of
                    two FSO's in our Eastern Section, Charlie Hulick and Jim Ruchti and with them
                    steered a sound path, avoiding extremist pressures. The three of them deserve
                    much credit.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I may ask, what was the military situation? Did we have
                        many troops there? Were they on alert? Were they on the border?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: The troops were certainly on the alert. I don't know how many troops we
                    had there, at least 6,000. Of course, militarily we would have been overwhelmed
                    by the Soviets. At the time, East Germans alone were revolting against Walter
                    Ulbricht. What was he, he was the secretary general of the SED and the actual
                    ruler in East Germany. In theory at least, according to four-power agreements,
                    the allied forces could have marched into East Berlin and established order.
                    Once the Russians countered, of course, that was no longer legally feasible. But
                    at the time when the Germans were revolting I think the western powers had the
                    right to do so. Of course, nobody had intention of doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the consequences of the June 17 uprising in our
                        view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: That's a good question. What were the long-range consequences? Well I
                    think it certainly shook up the East German regime. We mustn't forget that that
                    was after Stalin had died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Stalin died in March and this took place in
                        June.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: There was great turmoil, presumably in the ruling forces of the Soviet
                    communist party.</p>
                <p>There were rumors that Wollweber, who was the German chief of intelligence and of
                    course a KGB instrument, was advocating making concessions. He was removed
                    shortly afterwards. This is all something I don't know too much about, but it
                    was obviously of considerable importance. One of the consequences was a
                    reinforced split of the city, because for the first time there was really a
                    division. There were entrance/exit checks to control the refugee flow. It was
                    not completely stopped but it was diminished, and on the part of the west, it
                    became quite evident West Berlin had to be built up further and further. That
                    became one of the really important issues. Reuter at that time made a remark
                    which people didn't particularly appreciate. He said: “Now look, you got to
                    build up West Berlin, you should really have made it a capital, but you didn't.
                    West Berlin is the cheapest atom bomb in the heart of the eastern empire,”
                    meaning that as long as we held on to West Berlin, it's going to undermine the
                    viability of at least East Germany, or maybe the whole Soviet empire. Reuter
                    unfortunately died very soon thereafter, but I remember those words well.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>Reuter's death was an enormous blow not only to West Berlin but also to the west
                    German Social Democratic party where he had played a big role. It brought on new
                    elections in West Berlin for a new Governing Mayor, and a new cabinet. It wasn't
                    a direct election, of course, because the mayor was elected by the parliament,
                    the city assembly. He appointed his cabinet and it was then approved by the
                    parliament again. After a considerable struggle, Walter Schreiber, a CDU man,
                    together with an FDP minority got together enough votes to become Governing
                    Mayor. Walter Schreiber was also an old-time official of the Weimar Republic, a
                    competent man, a little colorless but quite up to the job. One problem occurred.
                    He had to appoint various FDP, Free Democratic Party people, to his cabinet. One
                    of them was a Dr. Eich who was supposed to take over the economics department,
                    which would have controlled the ERP, the American funded Marshall Plan programs.
                    That was something we were very interested in and we didn't like the idea
                    because Dr. Eich was not a terribly effective manager. So, I was able in various
                    discussions, with of course the approval of my superiors, to talk Dr. Schreiber
                    and all the people involved into keeping on Dr. Hertz who was from the SPD which
                    was not in the government. Dr. Hertz did not become a cabinet member but in
                    effect remained in control of the ERP and Marshall Plan affairs. That was
                    terribly important because he ran the programs competently and honestly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Hertz by the way an American citizen or a German at
                        this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: That I really don't know. I think he probably had dual citizenship.
                    Hertz was really very much a key figure, honest and a very competent official.
                    I'm not sure if Howard Jones was still there at that time, I don't think he was,
                    but he was right in supporting Hertz. Eventually, the relationship between
                    Berlin and the Federal Republic was enhanced. The fact that Schreiber was of the
                    same party as Adenauer helped because there were fairly many close connections.
                    Ernst Lemmer played a big role. Ernst Lemmer was a very interesting man, a good
                    speaker, a good politician, very afraid of Adenauer, but he was a very important
                    figure in the West Berlin party. Then slowly but surely, the legislative process
                    became easier to administer in Berlin. Allied vetoes were less and less
                    frequent. There was still a tendency on the part of some people to push for land
                    status in the Federal Republic, but that didn't play as much a role as it did
                    before. The next elections put the SPD in control again and Dr. Otto Suhr became
                    the Governing Mayor. Dr. Suhr was a very nice, very honest, very straitlaced,
                    excellent president of the city assembly, the Berlin parliament, but not a very
                    good mayor. He was one of the typical Social Democratic intellectuals who worked
                    much in theories and had problem administering the city. Besides, he became very
                    ill and died eventually of cancer. During Dr. Suhr's tenure there was the
                    Hungarian revolt.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: It played a big role also in Berlin insofar as there was a tremendous
                    demonstration in front of the Sch�neberg Rathaus, the City Hall, and some of the
                    speakers were pathetic. I was right in the middle of the officials. Dr. Suhr's
                    speech was intellectual, but it didn't strike a popular cord. He was followed by
                    Ernst Lemmer who was a good demagogic speaker and did a little bit better, but
                    by then the crowd was getting restless. Franz Neumann's speech was not very good
                    and some groups began to call for a march to the Brandenburg Gate. Nobody knows
                    what might have happened if they got to the border. Thereupon Willy Brandt, who
                    was chairman of the Parliament, grabbed the microphone and made a dramatic
                    speech quite spontaneously, hoarse as he was, and started marching the crowd not
                    towards the Brandenburg Gate, but towards the monument commemorating the victims
                    of Stalinism quite a distance from the Brandenburg Gate. There he led the
                    singing of the federal anthem, “Einigheit und Recht und Freiheit,” the third
                    stanza of the old “Deutschland uber alles,” and people began to calm down and
                    disperse. Some people say he may have avoided a blood bath. I don't think that
                    is quite true but who knows what could have happened in a confrontation at the
                    Brandenburg Gate. That episode really propelled Brandt into the big time
                    although it was already quite clear that he was a coming man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been very close to Reuter as I understand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Brandt was very close to Reuter and also an important figure in the
                    development of the SPD in West Germany because he represented, let's not call it
                    a right wing, but a moderate wing. He was instrumental in 1958 in converting
                    this old dogmatic rather stodgy Marxist party into something new through the
                    Godesberger program. He had links and connections with the Catholic and the
                    Protestant churches which was also important. It broadened the base of the
                    Social Democratic Party so that it could finally jump over the eternal 33% it
                    commanded.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: I don't think there was much mood for rumbling in East Germany. The
                    Soviets were clearly in control of the East German army and police. They
                    controlled the situation very thoroughly. Of course, the control was exercised
                    by the East German police, not the army.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Now, time moved on. There were some developments, again slightly closer relations
                    with the Federal Republic. Suhr was difficult to deal with because he was rather
                    scrappy vis-a-vis the commandants and resented the fact that the commandants
                    still had sovereignty in West Berlin. He did not speak English very well, and no
                    French. It was not a terribly good relationship but it worked. Then Suhr got
                    ill, and died in August 1957. The parliament elected Willy Brandt as Governing
                    Mayor who kept on most of the old cabinet and became a very strong figure in
                    Berlin. He worked very closely with us, with the Americans. He established an
                    excellent relationship with Bernard Gufler and Martin Hillenbrand, important
                    since the relationship with Suhr was not all that happy. At that time Eleanor
                    Dulles was already playing a considerable role—becoming as it were, “the Mutti
                    of Berlin”—by bringing into Berlin all kinds of aid projects: the Studentendorf,
                    the Student Village, and the Congresshall, all involving conflict with the
                    existing authorities. Gufler and Hillenbrand didn't really like her at all. She
                    had, I think, in essence a very good effect on the American/Berlin relationship.
                    Willy Brandt played her very well, was nice to her, and it helped. I think
                    Berlin got the better of the deal. There was the “Klinikum” which was one of her
                    favorite projects. It was a very good, interesting establishment for the medical
                    profession and made it a part of the university.</p>
                <p>There was one incident which I think was of considerable importance. That was
                    just before I left Berlin. If I recall this correctly, an American army
                    helicopter from Bavaria strayed into the east zone, had trouble and had to land
                    there. There were negotiations to get it out, initially conducted by the Potsdam
                    American military mission (each of the powers had a military mission in the
                    other's zone). The Americans had one in the Soviet area and the Soviets had one
                    in the American zone. The Potsdam Mission negotiations with the Soviets—Colonel
                    Pawel, I think, was the American—were unsuccessful. The Soviets continued to
                    insist we deal with the East Germans. For some reason, I am not sure at what
                    level, it was decided, certainly not on the Berlin level, the American
                    authorities began to talk to the East Germans and got the helicopter free. Now,
                    there were a lot of people among us, including Mr. Gufler, who thought this was
                    a serious mistake. The Soviets would have freed the helicopter after a while and
                    we should not have negotiated with the East Germans. Don't forget we were very
                    much in the cold war. The East and West Germans did not discuss things together
                    nor did the West Berliners and the East Berliners, and western allies did not
                    talk to the East German authorities. When I left, Willy Brandt had a little
                    evening with us, and he was also of the opinion that it may have been a mistake
                    to begin an American talk with East Germans. I left Berlin and had a fabulous
                    goodbye party, a lunch given by the whole senate and the presidium of the
                    parliament where I made a little speech. There were tears in some people's eyes
                    (including mine); it was really a moving affair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did this take place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: It was in June 1958.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had been in Berlin for thirteen years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Almost thirteen years.</p>
                <p>Here I want to mention an interesting man and how his career interceded with
                    mine. Herman Nickel was a high-school graduate, one of the first to be sent to
                    the USA as exchange. Back in the '50s in Berlin, we hired him as a helper in my
                    office. He went to meetings for me and reported on them and he was a highly
                    intelligent, useful sounding board. Later, he emigrated to the U.S., eventually
                    got a law degree, worked for some time for the NAACP, then joined Time-Life. In
                    South Africa he was expelled in the 60s, eventually became bureau chief in Bonn
                    and Time's diplomatic correspondent in Washington. Reagan appointed him
                    Ambassador to South Africa where he served usefully and successfully for 5
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you had seen some changes in those thirteen
                        years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: I had seen many changes in those thirteen years. Berlin was still a
                    smelling rubble when we moved in. And of course the change to real partnership.
                    That was a genuine partnership. I should not forget, by the way, in this whole
                    period, the important figure of Dr. Gunther Klein who was associated with Reuter
                    and Willy Brandt. He was also an old time Weimar Republic man. He was at one
                    time a Prussian Landrat, a high position, and a very intelligent, very shrewd
                    man. He was strictly a “burgerlich” (bourgeois) type of Social Democrat and was
                    very important in handling the legal relationship between the Federal Republic
                    and Berlin. He was also someone who pushed very strongly for closer integration
                    of Berlin and Bonn. One of his problems with the allied representatives was that
                    he did not speak any English or French, although he knew Latin and Greek. I
                    cannot emphasize enough how important it was in Germany that we had so many
                    Germans who spoke excellent English, and Americans who spoke excellent
                    German.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was quite a change for you, leaving Berlin and coming
                        back to an assignment in the Department. I understand that you were then
                        sent to the Bureau of Cultural Affairs. What did you do there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: Well, it was quite a change. In Berlin I was a big fish and there I was
                    a small one. The cultural affairs assignment was to program the European
                    exchange program, mostly a budget operation which I wasn't terribly keen about.
                    I thought I could exercise some influence about things I considered important
                    like the leader exchange program because of our experience in Berlin. We, on the
                    scene, selected or suggested people to go to the United States as leaders or
                    potential leaders and sometimes we found people in Frankfurt or Bonn on the
                    cultural affairs side who wanted to send others whom we did not consider good
                    material. This required considerable clout to change. We did not want to send
                    some museum director or somebody we didn't consider really important. We were
                    however usually able to send very important young people from Berlin who
                    eventually became very big people in the Federal Republic or in Berlin. Just to
                    mention Willy Brandt or Franz Amrehn who was deputy mayor for a long time, or
                    Neubauer, Lipschitz who unfortunately died very young, as very good people, who
                    grew in influence. But at Cultural Affairs (CU) I found myself mostly involved
                    in shuffling money around or seeing that Fulbright programs were properly
                    funded. It was not a terribly interesting job, but it was a job which required a
                    certain amount of doing and concentration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a chance to do any escort duty?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: No, none of that but my wife escorted Mrs. Brandt through the U.S. I
                    hardly ever saw any of the exchangees. I took a trip to Iceland and was able to
                    get a little bit of money for Iceland at one time, it was quite interesting
                    there. Then also a trip to Finland where we had some Finnish money which had
                    accumulated through their paying the Finnish war debt very punctually. So, I was
                    able to get a little bit of an increase in the grants which I think were quite
                    useful and talked people on the spot into selecting people that would be useful
                    later on to United States-Finnish relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling that Cultural Affairs was getting
                        much attention in the Department in those years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: I don't think the attention was very great. There was a political
                    appointee, Mr. Thayer, on the assistant secretary level to run the show. Al
                    Lightner was the professional in charge who did not like the job at all. It was
                    sort of a backwater, I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the relationship of the Department's cultural
                        program with USIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: It was always difficult. It was administered in the field by USIA. In
                    Washington, it was run by the State Department, although as I said, it was a
                    backwater. So the Cultural Affairs Officers in the field sometimes had different
                    ideas from those of the people in the State Department. I remember once there
                    was a meeting of Cultural Affairs Officers and Public Affairs Officers in Rome.
                    The Public Affairs Officers were often more receptive to political views. I
                    wouldn't say all Cultural Affairs Officers were not, but some of them were a bit
                    narrow-minded. There was this argument: Is for instance the leadership program
                    an instrument for the Ambassador to influence foreign policy, which is something
                    I and Don Edgar, then deputy to Al Lightner, advocated. We were set down, that
                    was not the purpose, etc. That reflects a little bit the tension. I think that
                    it is good that the whole program is now in the hands of the USIA and no longer
                    in the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there was the tension between the cultural and the
                        political viewpoints?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Definitely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you stayed with CU until you were summoned to work on
                        the Berlin task force. Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that task force was formed in 1958 or '59?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: No. That was 1961. '58 and '59 was a very critical period in Berlin
                    because it was the ultimatum Khrushchev made against Berlin that he'd turnover
                    this whole business to the East Germans. It would be then only between the
                    Western allies and the East Germans. I suspect our helicopter “cave-in” in early
                    1958 gave him ideas. There were all kinds of big conferences and some very weak
                    positions on the part of the allies. John Foster Dulles died and the Eisenhower
                    administration was more or less on the way out and I think that we were in many
                    ways lucky that some of the suggestions that were made were not accepted by the
                    Soviets. It could have gotten us into a lot of trouble.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the formation of the Berlin task force in 1961 you
                        moved effectively out of the CU Affairs, Cultural Affairs. Tell me how the
                        task force came about and what your tasks were.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: Well, the task force was created as a result of the growing tension
                    around Berlin. The refugee flow was increasing rapidly. It was quite obvious
                    that something was going to happen. This whole task force business became a part
                    of the development of the Operation Center which at that time was an invention
                    of Ted Achilles and John Stutesman. At first, the most important task forces
                    were of course the Vietnam task force and the Congo task force. Then the Berlin
                    task force was created. I was appointed just to collect the flow of information
                    and establish a filing system which expanded rapidly. There were the events of
                    June and July 1961; the earlier Kennedy confrontation with Khrushchev in Vienna
                    was one of the very important factors which established the task force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In June 1961.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Then in July 1961 there were speeches made by Senator Fulbright and
                    Senator Mansfield which caused old Berliners a little concern when they talked
                    about West Berlin and not about all of Berlin. We thought this was not the right
                    thing to do. The task force became very active very shortly before the Wall
                    became a fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, the task force was not caused by the Wall. It was in
                        existence before the Wall...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: It was in existence before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Wall came on 13th of August 1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes. The task force then was effectively taken over by Foy Kohler who
                    was Assistant Secretary, and Martin Hillenbrand who was in charge of GER. John
                    Ausland had just come back from Australia and he was made the GER expert on
                    Berlin. Jerry Holloway became sort of the task force manager. My own position
                    was a little bit difficult because I worked for Achilles and Ray Thurston, his
                    deputy. Both had different views from those of Foy Kohler—in other words, from
                    the ones who really ran the show.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that the task force was effective in what it
                        was doing? Did it get high level attention from the Secretary and from the
                        White House?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: That seemed to vary. In the beginning it was very effective because you
                    had people like General Maxwell Taylor attending. Secretary Dean Rusk appeared
                    quite often. The Secretary of the Treasury Fowler and all kinds of very
                    high-powered people came. Paul Nitze played a good role, and the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff had their representatives. So you had a mighty powerful task force. That
                    was after the Wall had gone up. But eventually I think the clout of the task
                    force was reduced. It was more or less a discussion and debate club where people
                    like myself were allowed to spout off occasionally and where my wife and the
                    other persons represented the intelligence community. But where the actual
                    decisions, the effective forces were, it was Martin Hillenbrand, John Ausland
                    and Foy Kohler who had direct contact with the President. I remember in one case
                    when John Ausland said at a task force meeting: “We decided that etc...” I
                    asked: “Who are we?” The task force had never heard of the matter. My remark
                    didn't go down too well, but it illustrates the situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there many differences between the views of the State
                        Department and those of the Defense Department in those days, or other
                        departments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: I would say yes. When the Wall went up 13th August, there was what I
                    considered a good deal of misunderstandings in many quarters of the significance
                    of it. I think it was on the 15th that there was a big meeting after which the
                    White House decided to ask Vice President Johnson to go to Berlin accompanied by
                    General Clay who still had a tremendous reputation, and to send a battle group
                    into Berlin. There were all kinds of misunderstandings because I think the White
                    House did not have a great deal of sympathy towards the plight of Berlin and the
                    Germans. The German Ambassador Dr. Grewe did not have a very good relationship
                    with the Kennedy administration. Kennedy I think distrusted Adenauer and Grewe.
                    There was that kind of thing going on. Of course it was overcome eventually when
                    people realized how the Berlin situation had changed. But on the task force we
                    had an insider group of people, as I said Martin Hillenbrand and Foy Kohler and
                    some others who worked with the White House. That was their job and they knew
                    where the orders came from. Our complaints were sometimes that they did not
                    fight hard enough for what would have been a little better course, but of course
                    I can't really judge that. There on the task force you had people who saw
                    things, let's say, more like us, cold warriorish. Paul Nitze was certainly one
                    of them. The representatives of the Joint Chiefs of Staff too, such as General
                    Taylor and his representative Larry Legere, myself, and a few others were
                    strongly in favor of vigorous action and we liked the idea of General Clay going
                    to Berlin and shaking up the situation. Flying helicopters into Steinstuecken
                    was a good idea for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Steinstuecken you might explain is an exclave of Berlin
                        which was then separated...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: It was an exclave of Berlin just outside the border of Zehlendorf but
                    part of Greater Berlin. It was really saved for the west by Ulrich Biel and
                    myself, I would say. There was a moment in the early days of the Kommandatura
                    when this issue came up and the Steinstueckeners couldn't get ration cards from
                    West Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were a part of West Berlin but cut off from it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: They had to walk a long stretch through East German territory to get to
                    the city proper. Colonel Babcock, who was Howley's deputy, proposed to give
                    Steinstuecken away. Biel wrote a letter, a memorandum, which went all the way
                    up, stating that neither Babcock nor Howley nor General Clay could give
                    Steinstuecken away because it was legally a part of West Berlin. That really
                    prevailed. Then I followed up by pushing the city to giving them ration cards.
                    We thus saved Steinstuecken until General Clay flew in helicopters and MPs and
                    it became an official American sector enclave, supplied by a mini-airlift.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you went along with General Clay and the Vice
                        President on this trip to Berlin after the Wall was put up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: That is correct. On the 19th of August I was along. I think it was Frank
                    Cash who made the suggestion that I should go along with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us about your experiences on that trip. How did the
                        Berliners receive this? Were they heartened or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: The Berliners were very enthusiastic. We had a problem before: Willy
                    Brandt had to make a speech on the 15th which was of course intended to hearten
                    the Berliners, give them heart, but he was obviously concerned and he sent a
                    telegram to Kennedy which was not received very favorably in Washington. It was
                    pretty blunt. It was an important document, and showed considerable wisdom. I
                    think it was first published in one of Eleanor Dulles's books “The Wall is Not
                    Forever,” which proved a good title for a book. The flight over was a rather
                    hectic affair. Everybody was set to drafting a speech for Vice President
                    Johnson. Everybody was dead tired when we arrived sometime in the evening around
                    6 or 7 at Tempelhof. We had a little cavalcade down the lanes to the Sch�neberg
                    Rathaus where there was an enormous crowd greeting the Vice President. All the
                    streets were lined all the way to the Rathaus in the so-called Brandenburg Hall,
                    a ceremonious hall. The Vice President made a speech where he made his famous,
                    “We pledge our sacred honor” and all was very favorably received, after which,
                    we all went to bed. Next day, it was announced that the convoy of a U.S. battle
                    group was coming down the autobahn through the East zone, and there was great
                    excitement. When it arrived it was greeted with great jubilation and joy. So I
                    would say despite some of the peculiarities of the Vice President's activities
                    in Berlin, the visit was a great success, a howling success. We took off around
                    midnight and had a long flight back, stopped over in Gander because a duck had
                    crashed into the windshield. The windshield had to be fixed, and we arrived
                    during the day at Andrews Air Force Base. I was pretty pooped out but I reported
                    to Maxwell Taylor right after my arrival on my impressions. I had met with
                    people in Berlin who presented a rather alarmist view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you're back in Washington in the latter part of August
                        1961 having to deal with the problems presented by the Wall. First of all
                        let me ask you, do you think we could have taken a realistic step to have
                        prevented the Wall from being erected?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: I don't think we could have prevented it. We did not foresee it. We
                    thought there would be a kind of wall around all of Berlin because the refugee
                    flow had to be stemmed. The able manpower out of the GDR, that is the German
                    Democratic Republic, was really draining and they had to do something. But we
                    expected, I think we all expected a wall around all of Berlin but not in Berlin.
                    Could we have prevented it? No, I don't think we could have prevented it. We
                    could have foreseen it a little bit earlier. We could have done something which
                    I consider very important, and that is not let the Wall appear to be a job of
                    the East Germans, it should have been a job of the Russians, the Soviets as
                    fourth occupying power. We should not have allowed the East Germans to stare our
                    generals down with guns. We could have moved our forces into the east sector
                    until they met the Soviets, which is exactly what happened at the so-called
                    “tank confrontation” in October where General Clay decided we were going to get
                    the Soviets into the act and show that it was a Soviet and not an East German
                    issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe that was the fall of '61, yes October of '61.
                        Well, now, what was your role after the Wall was erected on the task force?
                        Did you continue the same or did the pace speed up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: It continued the same, but I was a little bit a maverick in the problem.
                    I discussed the matter with Martin Hillenbrand because I felt a little
                    uncomfortable. He was the one who was going to write my efficiency report and I
                    was still working for Achilles and Thurston. And he said: “Well, the best thing
                    you can do is carry on as you do. You contribute something that way.” I was
                    maybe sometimes a little tactless in doing so, but had longer experience of
                    details than most anybody. There were points where I still think we could have
                    done better. First of all, as I said, we should have made it clear earlier that
                    it was the Soviets and not the East Germans whom we confronted. We had of course
                    some problems with our allies, especially the British who were very weak-kneed
                    on that business. Then came problems created by the micro-management from the
                    White House. There was for example a year later this terrible incident of Peter
                    Fechter who was shot by the East German police and fell between the lines,
                    between the Wall and the barbed wire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In no-man's land?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: In no-man's land and he was dying. Now a couple of weeks, maybe two
                    weeks earlier, when an old West Berlin friend, Rudolph Ketlein, press secretary
                    for Willy Brandt, talked to me and said: “Now look at it. What happens if they
                    shoot somebody and he's outside...” He was talking actually outside not between
                    the Wall, but outside the periphery in the zone. “Would you let him die there?
                    Is there something you can do about that?” I reported that and I think it was
                    absolutely applicable in the Peter Fechter business. We had a right to go into
                    East Berlin. The general in charge of the U.S. sector could have done something
                    but was under constraint to do nothing at all without first getting explicit
                    approval. He could have moved in and rescued Peter Fechter. Peter Fechter would
                    have died anyway probably, but we had a right to go into East Berlin. We did
                    establish that right by having Americans of the occupation moving back and
                    forth, going to the opera, by the tank confrontation, and our jeeps moving
                    around in East Berlin. The general had about three quarters of an hour to make
                    that decision. He couldn't make that decision, and I don't blame him, because
                    the orders would have to come from Washington, and it was too late, Peter
                    Fechter died. Fortunately I think we were forgiven. I don't think that anybody
                    remembers that we could have done that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were other incidents of course in later years, but
                        that was the one that I think drew attention to the inhumanity of the Wall,
                        shooting their own people.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes, shooting their own people. People swimming across the Teltow canal
                    and being shot at and there were a great many...I don't know how many people
                    were killed on the Wall, but there were quite a few of them. That is of course
                    what Honecker was being accused of, of having ordered the shooting of those
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, the Wall was a fact by this time. What happened
                        to the Berlin task force? How long did it continue in existence and what did
                        it do in this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: I went to Africa and I don't know when it really ceased being. I think
                    it sort of petered out. I think Pete Smith was for a while the task force
                    manager and then they still keep some of the files. But I think the longest
                    lasting member of the original task force was Martha Mautner. But there's also
                    one thing very interesting about which I don't know any details, but it was the
                    relationship between Kennedy and Ambassador Grewe. There were all kinds of
                    frictions and I'm not quite sure whether that didn't play a certain role. It
                    would be interesting to look into that a little further.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have to be to look at Ambassador Grewe's
                        memoirs as well as those in the White House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes, exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The task force wound down and your role was completed
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes, a few months later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were assigned to Khartoum in 1963. That must have been
                        a complete change for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: That was quite a big change. I am not quite sure whether it was a
                    terribly good assignment because I had no experience in the Arabic world at all.
                    I was to be chief of the political section. As it was, I rather enjoyed the
                    assignment, which lasted about two years although it probably didn't help my
                    career. It was an interesting assignment and in many ways rewarding. I also
                    think that I not only learned a little bit but I think I was in a way doing some
                    good there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: The Ambassador was Bill Rountree and the DCM was Tom McElhiney, both of
                    them experienced hands, both of them had been there for three years already. The
                    Ambassador was an old Middle-East hand. He had been involved in Egyptian affairs
                    in the days of John Foster Dulles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he was Assistant Secretary for the Middle East under
                        Mr. Dulles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Was he Assistant Secretary? I think you're right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Did you feel that you were accepted by the regional
                        specialists, the Arabists there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: You are talking about the Americans?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: I don't think I got very close to them. I had some difficulty because as
                    soon as I got aboard, we got information that the locals working for the
                    political section had to be fired because they were unreliable or had contact
                    with Egyptians. We also had a new young officer as an Arabist; he fortunately
                    turned out to be very good and really the backbone of the section later on, Art
                    Lowrie. But the whole assignment was difficult. I had a rather funny
                    introduction to the local scene because one of the important figures in Sudan
                    history was Slatin Pasha, an Austrian who as a young officer joined the
                    Anglo-Egyptian forces, and aged twenty-five became governor of Darfur, the far
                    western province. He got into a conflict with Gordon Pasha, on religious
                    grounds, staged a big long retreat of his Egyptian forces but was finally
                    captured by the Mahdi. He spent eleven years in prison in Omdurman, escaped and
                    became then, after the British victory over the Mahdi's successor, Inspector
                    General of the Anglo Egyptian-Sudan appointed by Kitchener. He stayed on until
                    1916. Now as it happened, his nephew Heinrich von Slatin went to the same school
                    as I did and on occasion we played with a toy railway in his yard and there I
                    once met the old gentleman, Slatin Pasha, and shook his hand. When I reported
                    this to some of the Sudanese they were quite excited. “He knew Slatin Pasha” and
                    that got me a fine entree with some people. One of them, by the way, made a very
                    interesting remark. He said: “You know the British were good administrators and
                    they were very smart in appointing Slatin Pasha as inspector general because by
                    the time he escaped, he had gotten to know everything that was important in
                    Sudan. He knew all the tribes and where they were supposed to graze or live
                    after the war. When he came back he rearranged the resettlement of the tribes
                    and it showed that the British were very intelligent administrators.”</p>

                <p>MAUTNER: They were very friendly to Americans; they were all together friendly

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to travel? The Sudan being the largest country
                        in Africa and...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: I traveled a bit. I took one trip out into the west, of course with a
                    military escort which was one way of getting around because there are no roads,
                    or only marginal roads. We had a truck escort and traveled in a jeep. First of
                    all, I flew out to El Obeid which is the regional capital of Kordovan. There we
                    picked up this escort and drove out to Darfur, the mountains of Djebel Mara
                    where they had water and oranges growing in a rather nice part of the country.
                    Then to Niala. We got caught by the rains and one of the escort officers said
                    we'd better get out because if we stayed any longer we'd have to stay there
                    through the winter. That was an interesting trip, and made a rather good trip
                    report I believe. Then I had another trip where we went to Abu Simbel which at
                    that time was not yet flooded, but was still the original Abu Simbel and then
                    came back by famous railway from Wadi Halfa through the desert which the British
                    had built when fighting the Mahdi. That was interesting, but more for
                    sightseeing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell at that time, it was of course many years
                        ago, that there would be the terrible troubles that the Sudan is now
                        experiencing? The regional fighting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: The regional fighting? Not at that time when I made the trip, but it
                    became quite clear that there would be trouble towards the end of my stay there.
                    First of all, the Arab Sudanese are just as black as the Southern Sudanese are,
                    but are of a different racial and tribal stock. They claim to be Arabs because
                    they have somehow a family line back to the Arab conquerors who then married
                    local girls. But they certainly dominate the situation, and at that time they
                    began to clean, let's call it ethnic cleansing, part of the South of foreigners
                    by getting rid of the Comboni fathers, the Catholic orders and other
                    missionaries who had split up the territories among themselves to work with the
                    Southern non-Muslim tribes. According to the Arabs the British had given various
                    parts to various missions in order to divide and conquer. Now, that immediately
                    isolated those parts from the outside world. Then you heard of trouble starting
                    here and there and the appointment of fairly powerful Northern Arab generals to
                    go out and take charge of garrisons in the South. It was quite clear that
                    something was brewing. Of course, there had been revolts in '56 when the country
                    became independent but they had stopped somehow. What we could do about it in my
                    days there, I don't know. At that time there were still a few expatriate people
                    in the South. One of them ran a tea plantation and a Greek merchant, sort of a
                    Greek patriarch, ran a big store in Juba, eventually had to give up and leave.
                    So the Europeans in that area began to be fewer and fewer.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>I had an interesting trip there when my family and I took a vacation in Uganda.
                    In those days Uganda was still a paradise and we drove around a couple of
                    thousand miles in a little Peugeot which we rented from an Indian, got
                    throughout the whole country, and on the way back, we flew from Kampala via Juba
                    to Khartoum and in Juba I got off the plane. We still had an AID expediter
                    there, and I stayed with him overnight. Went out hunting and shot some game.
                    There we saw herds of giraffes—running free. Then we still visited the old Greek
                    patriarch before I flew back. So I got a little bit of the flavor of the
                    situation in Juba. I went to the Catholic church there which was interesting
                    because the service was all in a strange language (it was already after Vatican
                    II) in a language I didn't understand. I noted that they had a crucifix with a
                    black Jesus on a white cross. I am not quite sure what the local Arab
                    administration reported about me going there but, anyway, that was quite an
                    interesting stopover.</p>
                <p>Then later in 1964, suddenly there was an uprising against the incumbent military
                    government. It had become quite corrupt, had lost influence and power. A student
                    uprising in which one student was shot, was seized on by the people who wanted
                    to revolt. They paraded the body up and down the main street and the government
                    just folded, resigned. A new moderate government took over. Very quickly
                    attempts were made by the communists who were ensconced in the trade unions to
                    take over. Fortunately, the communist organization had no mass support at that
                    time and supporters of the Mahdi family, the Ansari, came into town en masse
                    with their clubs and sticks. That was the end of the communists' attempt to move
                    in at that time. Later, the grandson of the old Mahdi, Sadiq El Mahdi, took over
                    as prime minister. He found that governing a country is not as simple as it
                    seems, especially if the country has internal divisions and economic and racial
                    difficulties. A variety of governments followed, sometimes a military group took
                    over. Sudan wound up eventually with a military dictatorship which ran into
                    great problems in the south, a real revolt of southern tribes. General Nimeiri's
                    military dictatorship was eventually overthrown, to be replaced by another
                    military dictator and then for a while there was quasi democracy again under
                    Sadiq El Mahdi. Now a military-fundamentalist Islamic dictatorship rules and is
                    engaged in a genocidal war against the non-Islamic southern tribes.</p>

                <p>MAUTNER: In May 1965, I left.</p>

                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: Yes. The children enjoyed themselves in the Sudan, and I enjoyed it
                    actually. The children went to the local schools, to the Comboni Middle School,
                    based on an Oxford-entry system. The American Embassy-run school was not
                    terribly good. I'm not quite sure if I made myself many friends for sending my
                    kids to the local school, but they learned arithmetic, spelling, and English
                    history (with an Italian accent).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which doesn't seem to have hurt them. Now, when you came
                        back to Washington, you were detailed to NASA, is this correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: That is correct. I was detailed to NASA. When I told this to the
                    secretary on the way out when I was given that detail, she said: “Oh, that's a
                    wonderful place. I spent my honeymoon there.” (She understood Nassau) Anyway,
                    the NASA assignment was the Office of International Affairs at NASA. In essence
                    we were handling the problem that had international, or in other words, required
                    State Department input. We dealt usually with Herman Pollack's Office of
                    Scientific Affairs, or whatever it was called at that time, and most of my time
                    was really occupied with working on agreements for tracking stations and ground
                    support in foreign countries or various things connected with support of the
                    Apollo program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you travel in this job or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Only a couple of times down to the Cape where there were Apollo-related
                    conferences, otherwise not. Later on, after the successful completion of the
                    Apollo program, I transferred to the civil service at NASA on the same level,
                    and handled part of the technology exchange program. NASA was supplying to the
                    Commerce Department or the State Munitions Control people, expertise about
                    technology exchanges, whether or not something should be permitted to go abroad.
                    My job was finding and shepherding the appropriate experts, because we were
                    dealing in some cases with far-out technology, things I certainly did not
                    understand and nobody else on the particular task force or committee understood
                    unless they were extremely well explained. So I located experts—NASA had experts
                    of all far-out technologies—and attempted to shepherd them so that their
                    explanations could be intelligible to the uninitiated. Our function was not only
                    to have a deciding voice in rare cases, but to explain the problems. These
                    usually hinged on clashes between the Commerce Department's efforts to export
                    something and the Defense Department's mandate to protect our technology and our
                    security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your work require you to deal with foreign embassies
                        here or the science attach�s in making arrangements in technology...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: Very little. The Apollo program was of course the important part. We had
                    to have landing strips for emergency aircraft in various places, for example, in
                    Mauritius. You don't just get a landing strip for that kind of big rescue
                    aircraft. It has to be built, so you have to negotiate with the countries and
                    sort of talk them into it. It takes a lot of time. Concrete doesn't mature in
                    twenty-four days. A good landing strip takes a year or longer to be built. So
                    that kind of thing was quite interesting and entailed many backs-and-forths and
                    explaining of the situation to the appropriate people at the State Department
                    (the Assistant Secretary of the African Bureau for instance as far as Mauritius
                    was concerned), keeping the people happy in Madagascar where we had an important
                    tracking station, all that kind of thing was part of our effort. There were
                    always a lot of negotiations between the people on the spot. There were
                    engineers on the spot who sometimes got in trouble or sometimes weren't very
                    diplomatic, and we and the State Department effectively controlled the situation
                    ultimately, in almost all cases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that NASA always had one advantage. It had money
                        which the State Department doesn't always have.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: That is true, yes. At that time certainly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, was there ever an occasion where a country turned us
                        down flat on our request for a landing strip?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: I also managed or shepherded a program called the National Geodetic
                    Satellite Program which required cameras and laser stations of a small kind to
                    be placed in various spots in the world for triangulation with a satellite in
                    order to determine the exact location of certain parts of the world. For
                    example; when we put our tracking station in Madagascar, we found we didn't
                    really know where Madagascar was because heretofore the distance between Africa
                    and Madagascar was estimated by ships going back and forth, and now that we had
                    a satellite, we found out that we were about twelve hundred feet off. This kind
                    of business, this program which was supposed to be a network over the whole
                    world was reasonably successful. But we had no tracking stations in the then
                    east bloc. We were generally not turned down because we usually had good
                    cooperation with the countries with the exception of India where we needed a
                    station in an area the Indians didn't want to give us entry. I recall few other
                    problems. Some of the problems were purely geographical because we had to have a
                    station in a completely ice-covered island in Antarctica and it posed logistic
                    problems for the people who ran the program, but no political problems in that
                    case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But generally you found that the nations were cooperative?
                        Because in fact all of them would benefit in the final analysis in
                        establishing their geographic location.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>MAUTNER: I think in general the nations were quite cooperative. It needed a good
                    deal of explanation sometimes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the people at NASA were pleased to have
                        someone from the State Department with them? Did you get cooperation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: I got cooperation on a personal basis. We had an office which was run by
                    a very difficult gentleman. He was not a great favorite of many people because
                    he was a very pushy, very brilliant man, but he was also a consummate bureaucrat
                    who insisted on doing things which sometimes other bureaus felt they could do
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I gather that after completion of your assignment at NASA
                        you retired?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You certainly had an interesting Foreign Service career
                        from the days you landed in a political job in Berlin in military uniform
                        until the time you were negotiating with the Indians and various African
                        nations in regard to the highest reaches of space. Thank you very much. But
                        one last question. What would you consider the greatest accomplishment had
                        been in your career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: Ah, it's a difficult question. I think the highlight of my career was
                    really my Berlin assignment. The fact that I was accepted in the Foreign Service
                    coming really completely from the outside. I don't know why, but evidently I did
                    a reasonably good job and the Berlin assignment was just something that was
                    ready-made for me. I was able to create a job, which was carried on later by a
                    variety of people who moved very well forward in the Service and the pattern I
                    set there for the relationship between Berlin and the American and also the
                    allied forces was, I think, important. I would go back to the days when I was
                    told by my predecessor that: “You have the mayor come in and stand at
                    attention,” and the way I managed to make my commandant be the first one to go
                    down to pay a call on the mayor, because the acting mayor happened to be Frau
                    Schroeder. I used the fact that she was a lady to play on the chivalry of a
                    cavalier (Howley) to set a precedent for the other commandants. I was
                    successful, I think, because I was able to make my contacts feel comfortable
                    enough to let their hair down when talking with me. It all led to considerable
                    loosening of relations between the various commandants (including the French)
                    and the local government.</p>
                <p>I believe that I had a chance to exercise more—and good—influence on American
                    attitudes and policy than my rank warranted. I did useful things for my country
                    and that is a good satisfaction.</p>

                        been your greatest frustration in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MAUTNER: There were lots of frustrations but nothing was the greatest. I would
                    say I had a reasonably happy career. I had ups and downs and I'm certainly
                    grateful to Uncle Sam that he has made it possible for a complete outsider and
                    one without a terribly good basic education to get as far as I did; to lead me
                    to Berlin where I met my wife who is a great inspiration; maybe that was my
                    greatest accomplishment, to have met my wife and captured her. Both of us, at
                    that time, worked for the formidable Rebecca Wellington, Political Advisor to
                    the U.S. commandant, later Consul General in Salzburg.</p>
